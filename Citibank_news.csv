HONG KONG, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Citigroup (C.N) has appointed William Pang as the head of its Natural Resources and Clean Energy Transition (NRCET) Investment Banking unit in Asia, according to a statement from the bank.

Pang joined Citi in 2015 and will continue to lead infrastructure investment banking in Asia, the statement said.

NRCET was established globally in March this year to work with the bank's clients on transitioning to cleaner energy.

Three of Citi's banking groups - chemicals, energy and power - were consolidated into one as part of a push to grow the bank's environmental sustainability coverage.

Pang will report to Jan Metzger, Citi Asia Pacific head of Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory, and globally to NRCET co-heads Stephen Trauber and Sandip Sen.

""Clean energy transition is a global super trend that is accelerating rapidly and will last decades,"" Metzger said in the statement.

NewsApi.org,"Summary Evergrande sends $83.5 mln for last-minute payment - source

Chinese property company faces more imminent debt deadlines

Next 30-day payment grace period expires on Oct. 29

Global financial markets on tenterhooks

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday, buying it another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

The property developer also announced plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Facing a deadline on Saturday to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, Evergande sent $83.5 million to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, the person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

That brought relief for investors and regulators worried about fallout for global markets and added to reassurances from Chinese officials that creditors would be protected. read more

Still, the world's most indebted property firm - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - needs to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default on Oct. 29.

With little known about its ability to pay and property sales tumbling 30% in the last 12 months, there is deep scepticism over Evergrande's capacity to ride out the crisis.

The company, once China's top-selling property developer, did not respond to a request for comment on debt payment.

Citibank declined to comment.

Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said on Friday the company would aim to make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business instead of property within 10 years.

Property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year by that time, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, he was quoted as saying by the state-backed Securities Times.

Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.

'BIT OF A RELIEF'

Evergrande's overall woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value. read more

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

It was not clear how cash-strapped Evergrande was able to raise funds to pay the bondholders or whether any had already received the money. Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Oct. 29 and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December. read more

""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.

""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next."" read more

If it fails to make next week's payment, or any other final deadlines in coming weeks, defaults would be triggered on all $19 billion of its bonds in international capital markets.

That would be the second biggest emerging market corporate default after Venezuela's state-owned oil firm.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each. read more

DISTRESSED LEVELS

Evergrande's dollar bond prices surged on Friday morning after news of the transfer, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of less than a quarter of face value.

Those gains evaporated on Friday afternoon in Asia, however, pushing several of the company's other bonds down more than 6%.

Evergrande's shares rose as much as 7.8% before closing up 4.3%, but still finished a shortened week down 8.8%.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds. read more

Chinese property companies could now be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year. read more

Still, Friday's news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index (.HSMPI) rise 3.3%.

In mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index finished up 2.4%, and an index tracking the broader property sector (.CSI000006) added 2%.

Asked whether it would step in to help its rival ease its liquidity crisis, the chairman of China's third-biggest developer, China Vanke Co Ltd (000002.SZ), said developers needed to ensure their own safety first.

""Everyone feels the chill as 'winter' arrives for the sector,"" Chairman Yu Liang told a company forum.

Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.

A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,"" said Quiddity's Lundy.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) said on Thursday it will require all U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of their employment.

The bank will comply with the Biden administration policy requiring all workers supporting government contracts to be fully vaccinated, as the government remains a ""large and important"" client of Citi, said Sarah Wechter, head of human resources, in a LinkedIn post.

However, the bank said it will assess exemptions on religious or medical grounds, or any other accommodation by state or local law, on a case-to-case basis.

Big Wall Street institutions have been grappling with questions around employee safety and how to bring back workers, as the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus spread across the country. While some firms have pushed back their return-to-office plans, others have chosen to stay the course.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said it will pay out $200 awards to its employees at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management who are fully vaccinated and going to office regularly.

However, investors were unimpressed and analysts pointed to the lack of progress in cost cutting.

Underlying expenses, which worried investors in recent years, were up 3% in the first nine months of this year.

Handelsbanken shares were down 3.2% at 0949 GMT.

It said its target of reaching an annual cost base of 20 billion Swedish crowns had lost its relevance due to higher development costs and its exit from Denmark and Finland.

“We are putting more and more in cloud-based solutions, that changes the playing field a bit,” CEO Carina Akerstrom told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

She said its other cost-cutting measures were developing according to plan, noting the bank had decreased its number of branches and staff, and that the effect on personnel cost would filter through in coming quarters.

The bank did not provide a new cost target.

Citibank said in a note that underlying costs “continued to disappoint” and said that it saw no visible improvement in personnel costs.

NewsApi.org,"In recent years, big tech companies have been pivoting into different industries. By applying their knowledge of emerging tech, they’ve been able to disrupt and overtake established players in the market. And with the emergence of open banking, they’ve now turned their sights on the finance industry.

Google Pay will soon let Citibank customers (and nine other banks) manage accounts directly from the app. Apple launched the Apple Card, its own credit card issued by Goldman Sachs. Amazon now offers up to $1M in loans to small businesses. Meanwhile, Facebook plans to launch its own digital currency Diem (formerly Libra) in the US.

Big banks need to innovate rapidly to compete with these emerging players who can offer new digital services to customers. However, while tech giants definitely have some key advantages over traditional banks — more development power, better equipped for innovation, and massive user bases — banks do hold an important card: customer trust.

Who do consumers trust most?

With life as we previously knew it being disrupted during the pandemic, many organizations have had to rethink their processes and operations to survive and emerge stronger in the new digital era. Values in society and business have shifted, and one of the most prominent attributes talked about today is the importance of trust. Consumers are more risk averse, with a heightened sense of which organizations they can trust and rely on.

In recent years, big tech, and particularly Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have faced criticism and a slew of investigations over the harvesting of users’ personal data. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to Siri and Alexa’s very unwelcome eavesdropping, more and more consumers are thinking twice about giving up their personal data in exchange for the companies’ services.

Another issue is security. Big tech’s track record with data breaches, both external and internal, have been called into question. Most recently, the data of 533 million Facebook users was posted in a low level hacking forum, meanwhile a number of Amazon employees were fired after leaking customer emails and phone numbers.

According to a report by Ponemon on privacy and security, 86% of adults said they were concerned about how companies like Facebook and Google use their personal data. At the end of the day, while these companies may offer different services to consumers from search engines to online marketplaces, their real revenue comes from advertising, which means data is gold.

The question is, with big tech’s move towards banking, will consumers be willing to trust them with their financial data?

All this means that banks could compete with big tech if they maximize on that trust gap. But tech innovation remains a significant hurdle.

Modern challenges for traditional banks

Differing from big tech, banks – based on centuries of experience – have been built for privacy and security. Berno Snijder, former Identity & Access Management lead atABN AMRO explained, from multi-factor authentication and audit trails to secure processes, “banks have multiple layers of defence before you can access the data.”

He continued, “regardless of what’s happening around us, people still trust banks today. It’s a safe haven. When you ask people who they trust more with their data, they would still choose the bank as being the safest.”

But this heritage is also their disadvantage in the race against big tech players.

Banks have been hesitant to adopt certain technologies, as the question around trust and privacy is brought to the forefront. If a bank decides to use a cloud solution, for example, to enable a more efficient and seamless product offering to their customers, they need to consider their responsibility and accountability for the data added to that platform.

Snijder admits that banks have been reluctant to adopt certain external solutions:

It’s the not-invented-here syndrome. Banks traditionally only trust the solutions that they build, manage and control themselves. This has two disadvantages. Firstly, they’re very expensive, and secondly, they’re not always customer friendly.

The biggest challenges facing banks today are slow growth, profitability, and digital adoption along with strict regulations. Outdated systems and processes may mean these institutions could fall behind financial big tech.

“The question is how can we manage that? I think the biggest puzzle we have to solve is how to collaborate with big tech companies — we cannot survive just ignoring them or trying to compete with them. You have to find a way to work with them, as a partner, as a competitor, and as an enabler. And the biggest beneficiaries should always be the customer,” says Snijder.

If you can’t beat them, join them

With the customer experience being a major factor, banks need to embrace the new technological challenge to improve, upgrade, and transform their processes and systems, and build on the digital innovation they lack. At ABN AMRO, this is seen through new partnerships being built with fintech start-ups, academics, and hackers, as well as through their Innovation Lab and introduction of AI, IoT, and blockchain.

Through its Digital Impact Fund, ABN AMRO partners with up and coming fintechs. This allows the bank to stay up to speed with the rapid pace of tech innovation and offer cutting edge products to customers, while providing fintechs with much needed funding.

For example, their partnership with Swedish startup Tink resulted in a personal finance management app called Grip. Meanwhile, their partnership with BehavioSec gives them access to the latest cyber-security technologies.

Designed to explore new ideas and opportunities for technology, society, and the product offering, the Innovation Lab is a prime example of how banks are transforming into modern businesses with an entrepreneurial mindset. Snijder explains,

New technologies like biometrics, the smart coffee machine, or identifying fraudulent transactions using Artificial Intelligence, bring new opportunities (and challenges) which are worth exploring to see if they can improve customer experience.

Maximizing trust by building society driven tools, features, and services

Developing customer trust is not simply about adopting the latest technology. It’s about using it to address wider trends and demands in society in line with consumer expectations. This is what will differentiate and ensure the continued success of traditional banks.

To really build trust, Snijder tells us:

We have to accept the trust experience is different for every individual. This means we have to put the customer experience in the centre of our service offerings, in line with our responsibility to make sure banking is available for everyone. There is a complete transformation from being a money-driven to a society-driven organization.

For example, during the pandemic, the bank quickly developed user-friendly personalized communication methods: an omnichannel customer experience that offers the option of video communication for customers, as well as an online platform that can be accessed via biometric authentication or a password, depending on each customer’s preference.

With these options, any customer, regardless of age or whether they are tech savvy, is able to continue banking in the way they feel comfortable with. ABN Amro tells us, “there is no one solution that fits all, we need to provide flexibility to the customer so they can choose what they want within the boundaries that we set. It’s a paradigm shift.” Listening and adhering to the customers’ needs nurtures the existing trust they have.

Supporting customers financially and evolving their offering along with societal changes will be imperative to ensuring the future of the traditional bank’s success in a digitally evolving world.",11/10/2021,Citibank,"Big banks need to innovate rapidly to compete with these emerging players who can offer new digital services to customers.

Oct 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N), like its Wall Street peers, made the best of a boom in dealmaking to post strong quarterly profit on Thursday, fending off a weakness in its lending business, which the bank's management said would continue to be under pressure.

A sizzling hot stock market and cheap borrowing costs have helped U.S. companies raise billions of dollars in debt and equity and funnel a big share of it into deals, for which they used large investment banks for advice.

The torrid pace of dealmaking boosted investment banking fees to an all-time record in the first nine months of the year, with banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Citi and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) benefiting the most.

""It was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade,"" Chief Executive Jane Fraser said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts.

The bank's investment banking revenue jumped 39% to $1.9 billion, helping offset a 16% decline in fixed-income revenue from a year earlier when there was unprecedented market volatility.

Its profit got a big boost by the decision to ease $1.16 billion from its loan loss reserves. A year earlier it had added $436 million to the reserves to survive a potential impact from the pandemic.

JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) have also released funds.

SLUGGISH LOAN BOOK

The reserve release along with a surge in deals helped Citi offset declines at its consumer bank due to lower interest income as customers saved up on cash during lockdowns and paid off loans. Net interest revenue declined 1% from a year earlier.

Executives said on Thursday that the bank had struggled to grow its lending business, even though consumer spending picked up during the quarter.

""Healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure,"" CEO Fraser said.

However, the silver lining is that net interest revenue was 2% more than the second quarter, suggesting an end to the downward trend that started when the pandemic began and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero.

Lower rates also hurt Citi's treasury and trade solutions business as revenue decline 4% even as it collected more fees and saw growth in trade loans.

Revenue from its branded cards in North America declined 1%. But on a positive note, cards purchase sales rose as consumer spending picked up. Spending for North America branded cards jumped 24% from last year.

Executives at other big U.S. banks have also said that consumers have started to show signs of taking on more debt as their cash balances diminish.

The results included the impact of a loss on the sale of its Australia consumer banking business. Excluding that, overall revenue increased 3%, driven by the institutional business.

EXPENSES RISE

For the three months ended Sept. 30, net income jumped 48% to $4.6 billion, or $2.15 per share, from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.65 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Operating expenses rose 5% to $11.5 billion as the bank spent more on technology and personnel to improve its control systems and comply with demands made by regulators a year ago.

Investors have been particularly concerned about Citi's expenses as it has not disclosed how much money and time it will take to meet the requirements of regulators and fix its systems.

Expenses for marketing credit cards have also been rising. Rival card-issuer JPMorgan said on Wednesday it could spend more on card marketing to attract spending from customers as the pandemic eases.

ZURICH, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A new multilateral climate action development bank is needed to help get money to emerging markets more effectively, analysts at U.S. bank Citigroup (C.N) said on Tuesday ahead of an upcoming U.N. climate summit.

Global leaders will assemble in Glasgow on Oct. 31 for the COP26 U.N. climate summit, aiming to thrash out more ambitious plans to cap global warming and agree the funding needed to help accelerate the planet's shift towards a lower-carbon economy.

Under the Paris climate agreement, developed countries have promised at least $100 billion annually to help address the climate financing needs of developing countries, while the summit itself hopes to help mobilise trillions in private sector finance towards climate investments.

Calling for a so-called Climate Action Development Bank, Citi proposed a new global institution dedicated to financing lower carbon developments, funded by nations across the globe.

""(We) believe it would be a far more efficient if capital were to be allocated with the assistance of an institution fully dedicated to achieving climate change objectives,"" the Citi authors said.

Such a bank could work together with other development banks, such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to coordinate climate action facilities and other goals.

It could further help harness trillions of private sector investments by adopting a blended finance approach, or public-private deals backed by government-financed institutions, and thereby reduce the risks and barriers for investors to back projects, particularly in emerging economies.

World business leaders also hope for a deal at the summit to resolve issues that have hindered use of carbon pricing to cut worldwide emissions. They look to boost the role companies play in slowing global warming. read more

""To stand any chance of staying within a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase, we need to do much, much more to reduce emissions,"" a team of nine experts concluded in the bank's 104-page global carbon market report, calling for a coordinated global effort to help price carbon and remove hurdles for developing countries to access climate financing.

""We cannot realistically expect emerging markets to fund their own decarbonization programs, and slow their economic growth ... The goal must fall at least in part on developed nations,"" the authors said. ""We need to find a mechanism whereby global efforts to decarbonize are funded efficiently and equitably.""

Indonesia's rupiah, the South Korean won and the Philippine peso eased between 0.1% and 0.5% as the greenback consolidated on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would announce tapering of stimulus at its meeting on Wednesday. Tourism-reliant Thailand's baht dropped 0.8% to a two-week low to be among the top losers, despite a resumption of travel for fully vaccinated people after months of restrictions. Thai stocks also slipped 0.4%. Investors want to see if there are new outbreaks after the re-opening, said Poon Panichpibool, markets strategist at Krung Thai Bank. ""After that, I think foreign investors will be more confident and will start to accumulate Thai equities again."" South Korean shares rose 0.5% as risk appetite got a lift after the country's exports posted their eighth straight month of double-digit growth in October. Malaysian stocks fell more than 2% even after the country announced plans to allocate 8.2 billion ringgit ($1.98 billion) for cash aid as part of its 2022 budget to be distributed to 9.6 million recipients. The market weakness is likely due to the announcement of new tax measures in the budget 2022, which includes the one-off prosperity tax on high-revenue generating companies as well as higher stamp duties on trading of shares, said Julia Goh, senior economist at UOB. Malaysia's central bank is also due to hold a policy review on Wednesday where it is likely to keep interest rates on hold to support the economy as it gradually reopens amid an intense COVID-19 vaccination drive, according to a Reuters poll.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. lenders are expected to report moderately higher third-quarter profits next week as pandemic-related accounting adjustments that had doubled their earnings earlier this year taper off and business starts to return to normal.

Analysts, on average, expect JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the country's largest lender, to report slightly lower profits compared with the year-ago period when it kicks off earnings season on Wednesday, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

Next Thursday, Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are both expected to report a 15% rise in profits, while Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is expected to be up about 35%. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which also reports Thursday, is expected to show a massive 100%-plus jump on a quarter in which results were depressed by unusual expenses.

Goldman Group Inc (GS.N) will cap the week on Friday, with profits expected to be up slightly.

Stock buybacks will provide a lift to earnings-per-share in the quarter and coming periods.

Investment banking divisions should deliver spectacular gains thanks to a record-breaking boom in takeovers, while a decline in fixed-income trading revenue will be partially offset by strong equity volumes.

But analysts say the focus will be on whether net interest revenue, which provides more than half of banking industry revenue but has been stagnant in recent quarters, is set to rise in coming months on higher interest rates and new loan demand from businesses and consumers.

""That's going to be the question. It is the heart of the business for everybody,"" said Gerard Cassidy, analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.

Some banks could show they are earning more interest because they started investing more of their excess cash in securities, such as 5-year U.S. Treasury notes which were recently yielding 1%, three times as much as at the start of the year.

Analysts will also look for signs that commercial and industrial borrowing has stopped declining. They expect an increase once COVID-hampered supply chains recover and allow businesses to build inventories that need bank financing. Many businesses and consumers paid down loans during the pandemic.

Bank of America's 35% expected jump in profits is likely to be driven by smaller provisions for loan losses and a rise in net interest income. Its results may suggest its strategy of investing its excess cash in government and mortgage-backed securities has paid off. read more

Unlike earlier this year, banks will benefit only marginally this quarter from releasing reserves for pandemic-related loan losses that did not materialize. Banks have already released 60% of a combined $50 billion of reserves they had put aside and will likely release only $5 billion more this quarter, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden.

He expects Wells Fargo and Citigroup will feel the greatest benefit.

Results for those two banks could also be influenced by how much they are having to spend to comply with orders from regulators to improve their controls. read more

Wells Fargo's year-earlier profits were hurt by costs for making amends to customers for wrongs.

M&A FEES, TRADING

Takeover advisory fees at the big investment banks will be up by 80% on average, Cassidy said, adding that he also expects a lift from equity underwriting.

Trading revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be down about 10% on average because fixed income markets, which drove record trading volumes last year, have settled down to more normal levels.

JPMorgan third-quarter net income is expected to decline about 3% from a year earlier on lower trading revenue and higher expenses, according to the average analyst estimate.

Results from investment banking giant and money manager Morgan Stanley are expected to rise on higher takeover advisory fees, stronger equities trading revenue and more wealth management fees.

Goldman Sachs is also expected to benefit from higher mergers and acquisitions fees amid the biggest global deals boom on record. read more

Most banks will report that expenses increased more than revenue, according to Ramsden. Keeping up with competitors continues to require more spending on technology. Analysts are also wary that banks have to pay more to attract employees.

Summary Investors await FY results in Q1 to gauge full extent of strain

China property sector issuance fell to near-four year low in Q3

High yield property default rates hit record high of 6.7%

HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China property companies could be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year as global investors wait on the sidelines for embattled China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) to work out its debt woes, fund managers and advisors said.

Even though Evergrande confounded market expectations by delivering$83.5 million to its Citibank trustee on Thursday to pay a bond coupon originally due on Sept. 23 and stave off imminent default, the move will do little to calm nervous property market investors, they added.

Instead, markets are likely to remain fractured which could lead to more asset sales and a scramble to lock in expensive private fund raising by lower-rated companies looking to refinance debt and avoid their own defaults in the next year.

""We may need to wait for full year results which likely happen at the end of the first quarter next year as investors will need to see how...tight the financials of the property developers are,"" PineBridge Investment's Arthur Lau said.

While Evergrande's payment was a positive, it still needs to make overdue coupon payments of $195 million, with the next major deadlines to avoid default on Oct. 29 and Nov. 10. It then has a further $340 million of coupon payments due on its offshore bonds between Nov. 1 and Dec. 28.

Lau said investors would be closely monitoring Chinese property sales, adding he expected capital markets to reopen at best in the first quarter.

""We do expect few more defaults before year end so it's hard to have (developers) come to market with such backdrop.""

Data on Friday showed China's government land sales slumped for a second month in the fast-cooling property sector.

The real estate sector accounts for a quarter of China's overall bond stock and more than half of its high yield debt, according to JPMorgan. The sector also has the highest share of high yield bonds at 69%.

Nearly $322 billion worth of bonds from mainland Chinese companies, in various currencies, are due to expire in the current quarter, according to Refinitiv, or 1,251 issues.

Over the next 12 months, China's property sector alone has $28.3 billion worth of offshore debt due. The largest before the end of 2021 is Shui On Development's $500 million deal in late November.

Fantasia Holdings Group Co. (1777.HK), which missed a $206 million bond repayment in early October, has nearly $420 million worth of bonds maturing in mid-December.

LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE

Investors are likely to remain cautious about buying lower rated Chinese property debt until property sales and mortgage applications start to rise, fund managers say.

""Property companies were very active in the U.S. dollar bond market because of the lower interest rates that were on offer, but going forward it will depend on how international investors look at this sector,"" BOCOM International's head of research Hong Hao said.

""There are some high risk investors still interested, but the dynamics of the Chinese property market have changed.""

A slowdown in debt issuance from the sector is already evident, with China's property developers issuing just $2.7 billion worth of offshore bonds in the third quarter, Refinitiv showed, the lowest quarterly amount since the end of 2017.

There has been little sign of a turnaround in October.

""Right now, it would be very challenging for any China property issuers to access the bond market,"" said Soo Chong Lim at JPMorgan, who expects more defaults over the next few months.

She would like to see some ""signaling from the central government on stabilising both funding conditions and the physical market before tip-toeing back into the lower part of the credit curve.""

JPMorgan calculates that the year-to-date default rate for China's high yield market stood at 5.2% and for high yield in the property sectors at 6.7% - both record highs.

Herbert Smith Freehills partner Alexander Aitken said the property firms were facing a loss of investor confidence which was unlikely to be resolved in the near-term.

""It could be tough for high yield Chinese property issuers with their usual investor community because we can already see bond yields rising very substantially,"" he said.

""The interesting question is whether the current situation will be restricted to the property sector or start to spread more broadly into the Chinese credit market.""

NewsApi.org,"China Evergrande Group wired funds to a trustee account on Thursday for a dollar bond interest payment due Sept. 23, a source told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have plunged the embattled developer into formal default.

The source corroborated a story in the state-backed Securities Times on Friday that the company had remitted $83.5 million in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday, allowing it to pay out to all bond holders before the grace period expires on Oct. 23.

“They seem to be avoiding short-term default and it’s a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,” said a Hong Kong-based restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders.

“But still, Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring.”

Evergrande did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Citi declined to comment.

News of the wired payment comes a day after financial information provider REDD reported on Thursday that the company had secured more time to pay a defaulted bond issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises and guaranteed by Evergrande.

A string of Chinese officials in recent days have sought to reassure investors, saying that creditors’ interests would be protected. Market participants nevertheless expressed shock at news of the payment.

“This is a positive surprise,” said James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd, adding many had expected a default.

The news would boost bondholders’ confidence, he said, as “there are many coupon payments due ahead. If Evergrande pays this time, I don’t see why it won’t pay the next time.”

Evergrande missed two coupon payments on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29, starting the clock on 30-day grace periods for payment. Non-payment of interest for 30 days would result in a formal default by the company, and trigger cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar bonds.

Evergrande’s dollar bonds surged on Friday morning, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, according to data provider Duration Finance.

Evergrande’s shares rose about 4%, a day after the resumption of trade following a more than two-week suspension pending the announcement of a scrapped stake sale in its property management unit.

She’s also kind of giving a younger Shiv Roy from Succession.

Based on real events detailed in the New York Magazine article “How Anna Delvey Tricked New York’s Party People,” Inventing Anna tells the story of convicted fraudster Anna Sorokin, who spent years posing as the wealthy and generous German heiress Anna Delvey.

Sorokin, after successfully inserting herself into New York’s wealthy social scene, became one of the most notorious con artists of the 2010s. In 2019, Sorokin was sentenced to nine years in prison for grand larceny. Currently, she remains in ICE custody and faces deportation to Germany.

The miniseries will follow Sorokin’s story though the lens of the journalist (Anna Chlumsky) investigating the depths of her fraud. But is Anna New York’s biggest con woman or is she simply the new portrait of the American dream? Anna and the reporter eventually form a dark funny love-hate bond as Anna awaits trial and the reporter seeks to answer the biggest question in NYC: who is Anna Delvey?

In addition to Garner, the all-star cast of Inventing Anna includes Arian Moayed (Succession), Katie Lowes (Scandal), Anders Holm (Workaholics), Jeff Perry (Scandal), and Laverne Cox (Orange Is the New Black).

Shonda Rimes and Netflix triggered New York’s “Son Of Sam” law when they bought the rights to Sorokin’s story in 2019. The $140,000 payment intended for Sorokin was frozen, as the law prohibits felons from profiting from screen or book adaptations of their convicted crimes. The money ended up going toward paying back some of the money Sorokin defrauded from City National Bank and Citibank, which is just rich.

NewsApi.org,"But Sergey Chernenko, an associate professor of finance at Purdue University’s Krannert School of Management, who was not involved in Dr. Howell’s research, said the new paper aligned with his own findings on race-based gaps in Paycheck Protection Program lending. At an economic conference next month, he will present a paper that concluded that Black-owned businesses were disproportionately left out of the relief program.

“This fits very well with and complements our finding that minority-owned businesses were less likely to get loans because of racial bias, and to the extent that they do get them, they’re more likely to get them from fintechs than banks,” Dr. Chernenko said.

The government designed the Paycheck Protection Program to be virtually risk-free for lenders: They would advance small companies up to $10 million — the size of the loan was based on the company’s head count and payroll — and the government would then pay off the loans in full for business owners that followed the rules. If the borrower defaulted, the government would still repay the lender. In theory, any lender should have been willing to lend to any qualified applicant.

It didn’t work out that way. Many banks limited their loans to their current customers, which was a hurdle for owners who lacked business checking accounts or loans. But even Black owners who had accounts were noticeably more likely than those of other races to end up with a fintech loan, Dr. Howell and her co-authors found.

The effects were strongest in parts of the country with higher levels of racial animus, which the study measured with variables like the extent of local housing segregation and the prevalence of racially charged Google searches.

The researchers tested — and found little evidence for — other common hypotheses about the program’s racial lending disparities. Even after controlling for variables like the applicant’s ZIP code, industry, recent revenue, affinity for online lenders, and loan size and approval date, the gap persisted.

This was not the case, they found, at the nation’s biggest banks. After researchers controlled for those elements, Black-owned businesses appeared to be just as likely as any other to get a loan from Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.",11/10/2021,Citibank,"At an economic conference next month, he will present a paper that concluded that Black-owned businesses were disproportionately left out of the relief program.

NewsApi.org,"What happened

Shares of Macy's (NYSE:M) were climbing higher this week after investors responded positively to news that Saks Fifth Avenue's e-commerce unit was seeking to go public early next year at a valuation of $6 billion, making Macy's business look more valuable by comparison. The news came after activist investor Jana Partners had urged Macy's in a letter last week to make a similar move, splitting its digital business from its brick-and-mortar stores.

As of Thursday at 2:05 p.m. EDT, the stock was up 9% for the week.

So what

Macy's shares surged on Monday after the news broke about Saks. According to The Wall Street Journal, Saks' e-commerce unit is aiming for IPO in the first half of 2022 and targeting a valuation at $6 billion, which is triple the $2 billion it was worth in March. Like Macy's.com, Saks' online business has soared during the pandemic, and investors, including Jana Partners, are hoping Macy's can make a similar move to unlock value.

After the stock jumped 17.5% on Monday, shares cooled off on Tuesday, falling 6.1% as investors perhaps realized that the Saks news has no direct bearing on Macy's, since management has not given any indications that it is considering such a move despite pressure from Jana Partners.

Wall Street analysts also weighed in on the debate. In a note this morning, Citibank analyst Paul Lejuez said he didn't think a separation between the digital and physical businesses made sense for Macy's, especially as the company has spent years integrating the two to refashion itself as an omnichannel retailer. Lejuez maintained a sell rating on the stock and a price target of $20.

On the other hand, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised his price target from $27 to $32 and kept an outperform rating on the stock. Though he didn't think a spin-off of the e-commerce business was likely in the near term, he believed it could be worth $40 per share or more as a stand-alone entity.

Now what

While the valuation argument for the separation might make sense for the retail stock, Macy's would face some challenges. Notably, the company has several hundred stores compared to just a few dozen Saks locations, making the move more logistically difficult, and it would undermine the omnichannel efforts Macy's has undertaken in recent years.

Still, such a split could allow investors to see the value of Macy's online business, and Jana has been a successful activist before, getting Whole Foods to sell itself to Amazon in 2017.",21/10/2021,Citibank,"What happenedShares of Macy's (NYSE:M) were climbing higher this week after investors responded positively to news that Saks Fifth Avenue's e-commerce unit was seeking to go public early next year at a valuation of $6 billion, making Macy's business look more valuable by comparison.

NewsApi.org,"Amazon.com Inc has been repeatedly accused of knocking off products it sells on its website and of exploiting its vast trove of internal data to promote its own merchandise at the expense of other sellers. The company has denied the accusations.

But thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by Reuters – including emails, strategy papers and business plans – show the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets.

The documents reveal how Amazon’s private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from Amazon.in to copy products sold by other companies, and then offered them on its platform. The employees also stoked sales of Amazon private-brand products by rigging Amazon’s search results so that the company’s products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report for India put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results” when customers were shopping on Amazon.in.

Among the victims of the strategy: a popular shirt brand in India, John Miller, which is owned by a company whose chief executive is Kishore Biyani, known as the country’s “retail king.” Amazon decided to “follow the measurements of” John Miller shirts down to the neck circumference and sleeve length, the document states.

The internal documents also show that Amazon employees studied proprietary data about other brands on Amazon.in, including detailed information about customer returns. The aim: to identify and target goods - described as “reference” or “benchmark” products - and “replicate” them. As part of that effort, the 2016 internal report laid out Amazon’s strategy for a brand the company originally created for the Indian market called “Solimo.” The Solimo strategy, it said, was simple: “use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.”

The Solimo project in India has had international impact: Scores of Solimo-branded health and household products are now offered for sale on Amazon’s U.S. website, Amazon.com.

The 2016 document further shows that Amazon employees working on the company’s own products, known as private brands or private labels, planned to partner with the manufacturers of the products targeted for copying. That’s because they learned that these manufacturers employ “unique processes which impact the end quality of the product.”

The document, entitled “India Private Brands Program,” states: “It is difficult to develop this expertise across products and hence, to ensure that we are able to fully match quality with our reference product, we decided to only partner with the manufacturers of our reference product.” It termed such manufacturer expertise “Tribal Knowledge.”

This is the second in a series of stories based on internal Amazon documents that provide a rare, unvarnished look, in the company’s own words, into business practices that it has denied for years.

Amazon has been accused before by employees who worked on private-brand products of exploiting proprietary data from individual sellers to launch competing products and manipulating search results to increase sales of the company’s own goods.

In sworn testimony before the U.S. Congress in 2020, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos explained that the e-commerce giant prohibits its employees from using the data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. And, in 2019, another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favor them.

But the internal documents seen by Reuters show for the first time that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favor Amazon’s own products, as well as copying other sellers’ goods, were part of a formal, clandestine strategy at Amazon – and that high-level executives were told about it. The documents show that two executives reviewed the India strategy – senior vice presidents Diego Piacentini, who has since left the company, and Russell Grandinetti, who currently runs Amazon’s international consumer business.

In a written response to questions for this report, Amazon said: “As Reuters hasn’t shared the documents or their provenance with us, we are unable to confirm the veracity or otherwise of the information and claims as stated. We believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated.” The company did not elaborate. The statement also did not address questions from Reuters about the evidence in the documents that Amazon employees copied other companies’ products for its own brands.

The company said the way it displays search results doesn’t favor private-brand products. “We display search results based on relevance to the customer’s search query, irrespective of whether such products have private brands offered by sellers or not,” Amazon said.

Amazon also said that it “strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data for the benefit of any seller, including sellers of private brands,” and that it investigates reports of its employees violating that policy.

Piacentini and Grandinetti didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The unfiltered insight the documents offer into Amazon’s aggressive use of its market power could intensify the legal and regulatory pressure the company is facing in many countries.

Amazon is under investigation in the United States, Europe and India for alleged anti-competitive practices that hurt other businesses. In India, the allegations include unfairly favoring its own branded merchandise. Amazon declined to comment on the investigations.

Jonas Koponen, an antitrust attorney with Linklaters LLP in Brussels, said the Reuters findings on Amazon’s practices in India would likely interest the European Commission, which is probing whether the company has used non-public seller data to boost its own retail business. India has cooperation agreements with the United States and the European Commission to exchange information related to enforcement of antitrust laws.

“When any one competition authority is looking into aspects of one of these globally present organizations’ behavior, they will certainly be interested in understanding what evidence there is in other parts of the world and the extent to which that evidence relates to the practices that they themselves are investigating,” Koponen said.

The documents also support criticism of Amazon laid out by Lina Khan, the new chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Khan published a paper in 2017 that argued that Amazon’s private-brand business raised anti-competitive concerns.





“Use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.”







“It is third-party sellers who bear the initial costs and uncertainties when introducing new products; by merely spotting them, Amazon gets to sell products only once their success has been tested,” she wrote. “The anticompetitive implications here seem clear.”

Amazon filed a petition in June with the FTC asking that Khan recuse herself from all matters related to the company because of “her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws.”

Khan and the FTC didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the first article in this series, Reuters reported in February that Amazon had for years given preferential treatment to a few big sellers on its Indian platform, and used those sellers to circumvent regulations designed to protect the country’s small retailers. That report triggered action by India’s main financial crime-fighting agency, which sought information and documents from Amazon. In addition, the nation’s antitrust watchdog submitted the story as an exhibit in a court battle with Amazon over its investigation into the company’s alleged anti-competitive practices. The court rejected Amazon’s request to halt the probe.

“We are committed to extending cooperation to all authorities in India and are confident about our compliance,” Amazon said in its statement to Reuters.

Like many other retailers, Amazon views its own brands as a major driver of increased profitability. Private-brand products often have higher profit margins than normal retail brands because production and marketing costs can be lower.

An internal email sent by Amazon executive Grandinetti to a group of company executives in December 2018 stated: “We believe that over the next several years, Private Brands will be one of the most important growth and profitability drivers in the Consumer business.” Grandinetti added that company executives believed private brands “can achieve 10% penetration” of the company’s consumer business worldwide over the next five years.

Introducing Amazon’s own brands was especially critical in India. The company began its e-commerce foray there in 2013, and soon recorded millions of dollars in losses, one internal document shows. To make the business “sustainable in the long run,” the 2016 Private Brands document notes, Amazon embarked on a strategy centered on introducing its existing private brands, such as AmazonBasics, and new ones tailored to India.

The 2016 document stated a goal: offer Amazon’s own goods in 20% to 40% of all product categories on Amazon.in within two years. Amazon would achieve profitability in its private-brand business by “only launching products that will provide more margin than comparable reference brand products.”

Amazon predicted private-brand sales would reach nearly $600 million by 2020 in India, according to a 2017 internal business strategy document. “We will be amongst the Top 3 brands in each sub-category that we play in,” the document stated.

Whether it achieved that sales goal isn’t clear; Amazon doesn’t disclose its private-brand sales in India. The company didn’t comment on the strategic goals and other details from the documents reported in this article.

An Amazon press release in 2018 revealed just how successful its private-brand business was becoming in India. Celebrating “record sales” during an annual promotion, the release stated, “Amazon Brands saw its best performance ever with 11X jump over last Great Indian Festival.”

Today, Amazon.in lists thousands of Amazon-branded offerings – from garbage bags, bed sheets and soap to air conditioners and televisions. According to the website, many are best-sellers.

One key person involved in 2016 with Amazon’s private-brand business in India was Amit Nanda, who later became a country director of the program, according to his LinkedIn profile. He holds an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, one of the nation’s top business schools. Before joining Amazon in 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile, he worked at Citibank and the Indian arm of consumer-goods giant Unilever.

As Amazon was reviewing its private-brand strategy in India in 2016, Amazon India employees had a meeting with Grandinetti. A longtime Amazon manager, at the time he was in charge of content for Kindle, the company’s popular reading device. But Amazon had announced that he would soon lead its international consumer business, including India.

During the meeting, Nanda was assigned various tasks, according to one Amazon document. Among them: The India private brands “business should be large and profitable. Build for scale.”

Nanda declined to comment for this story.

‘Glance views’

With its population of 1.3 billion people and a growing middle class, India represents a huge and potentially lucrative market for Amazon. But it’s also a country where foreign e-commerce players face a complex and protectionist regulatory regime.

The country’s brick-and-mortar retailers comprise an important political constituency for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Concerned that predatory pricing could hurt these merchants, India prohibits foreign e-commerce players from selling most goods directly to consumers, as they do in many other countries. Amazon and other foreign companies are restricted to operating an online marketplace of third-party sellers, with no one vendor allowed to hold an advantage over another. As a result, Amazon sells most of its private brands through other vendors.

In launching its private-brand business, internal documents show how Amazon used its Indian website to gain a clear edge for its own products on the platform. The creation of its Solimo brand offers a case study.

According to the internal documents, the word Solimo is derived from Solimões - the name for the upper stretches of the Amazon River in Brazil.

With the Solimo line, Amazon aimed to offer items that equaled or exceeded the quality of competing brands but were 10% to 15% cheaper, the 2016 Private Brands document shows. Amazon employees studied different product categories, and compared their overall market size with how well those segments were doing on Amazon.in. They then targeted categories such as home furnishings. Amazon found that furnishings was a $2 billion business in India - but its own website’s three-month sales in mid-2014 totaled about $1 million.

In its analysis, Amazon used a metric called “glance views” that quantified which products were being viewed by customers on its website. Explaining why it zeroed in on glance views, the 2016 Amazon document noted that monitoring its India website traffic provides “an opportunity to influence interested customers who are actively considering” a purchase in a product category.

Amazon has said some of the data its private-brand teams use in launching products is public – such as the website’s rankings of best-selling merchandise. This is how Amazon described the system to a U.S. congressional subcommittee last year: “Like anyone else at Amazon or in the general public, members of these teams can also visit Amazon’s product detail pages to learn a product’s best seller ranking and read customer reviews and star ratings to assess whether a product is selling well in Amazon’s store.”

But seven current and former Indian sellers on Amazon.in told Reuters they can’t access internal sales data of rival brands offered on the website. Four of the sellers said they can access glance views, but only for their own products. Amazon has access to more data on sellers, including the number of product units shipped and details about customer returns, the 2016 document shows, giving it an advantage in market intelligence.

Amazon’s own use of the data to develop and promote its private-brand products “destroys the level playing field,” said one current seller, who asked to remain anonymous.

Amazon said in its statement that it “does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace.” The company also said it “identifies selection gaps based on customer preferences at an aggregate level only and shares this information with all sellers.”

How to ‘replicate’ products

Once Amazon’s private-brand employees had decided which categories to enter, they reviewed sales and customer-review data on Amazon.in to identify “reference” or “benchmark” brands to “replicate,” the 2016 private-brand document showed.

In the case of Solimo, the 2016 document stated that to ensure the brand’s goods meet “customer requirements in terms of performance we identify and replicate these reference products.” Amazon had no comment on the Solimo project.

Amazon’s strategy also called for manufacturers of its private-brand products to use other companies’ goods as models to develop samples for pre-production testing.

Among the brands Amazon employees planned to “benchmark,” the document states, were American ones – “Old Navy/GAP” men’s shirts. The document does not indicate whether the employees followed through.

Gap Inc, which owns the Old Navy and Gap brands, declined to comment.

The rival products Amazon targeted also included other brands popular in India. For pots and pans, a “reference brand” was Prestige, one of India’s largest kitchen-equipment companies. For men’s shirts, the benchmarks included Peter England and Louis Philippe, both made in India by conglomerate Aditya Birla Group.

Amazon also targeted John Players, a menswear brand then owned by Indian conglomerate ITC Ltd.

Chandru Kalro, managing director of TTK Prestige, which owns the Prestige brand in India, told Reuters, “We have no knowledge of us being a ‘reference brand’ for Amazon and we don’t know what it means to be an Amazon reference brand.”

Aditya Birla Group declined to comment. ITC did not respond to a request for comment.





“We concluded to follow the measurements of Business Shirt of John Miller for Xessentia because of wide acceptance with our customer base.”







In early 2016, Amazon private-brand employees were internally noting the success of Xessentia, a clothing brand they had launched on Amazon.in in partnership with a seller. The seller owned the brand; Amazon designed the products.

Sales of Xessentia men’s business shirts were surging, and in the first quarter of 2016 had become that category’s second-most popular brand on the India site after the American brand Arrow, licensed to the Indian company Arvind Fashions. To create the Xessentia line, Amazon had used Louis Philippe as the benchmark brand, because it was “premium and popular,” the 2016 document said.

But something was amiss: About one in every 12 Xessentia shirts was being returned in the first quarter of 2016 for sizing issues. More than 350 were returned because customers complained they were too small.

Amazon employees conducted a “deep dive,” the 2016 document reports, by poring over a year’s worth of data from Amazon.in, including customer complaints and return numbers for Xessentia, Arrow and seven other brands. They found that a brand of men’s business shirts in India called John Miller had far outsold Xessentia shirts, despite carrying “a similar” average selling price. John Miller also had about half the rate of customer returns for “quality issues.”

The upshot: “Our learning is that our customer is different from the Louis Philippe customer and doesn’t prefer this fit,” the 2016 document stated. “We concluded to follow the measurements of Business Shirt of John Miller for Xessentia because of wide acceptance with our customer base.”

So Amazon revised the fit of Xessentia shirts to copy John Miller’s sizing, matching it down to the neck, shoulder, armhole, sleeve and waist dimensions.

Amazon didn’t reply to questions about its Xessentia project. Arvind Fashions declined to comment.

John Miller is a brand owned by retail mogul Kishore Biyani. Amazon and Biyani later became business partners in India, but had a falling out. Amazon is now embroiled in a legal battle with Biyani over the proposed sale of his retail assets to Reliance, which is run by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, considered India’s wealthiest man. Ambani and Amazon are fierce rivals, with the Indian magnate in recent years launching his own e-commerce business.

A spokesperson for Biyani’s Future Group said the company was “shocked and surprised” to learn that Amazon was using Indian brands to build its own. “They are in a powerful position of being both an online marketplace operator and a seller and collector of data,” the spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. “This is leading to misuse of consumer and seller data giving them the power to kill Indian entrepreneurs and their brands.”

After the launch of Xessentia, Amazon introduced a brand of U.S.-and-European-style clothes in India called Symbol.

“For every product line identified for launch, we will identify an optimal reference brand based on customer reviews and size of business,” state the plans for Symbol and another private brand. “The replication of the ‘Fit’ of this reference brand will be a crucial step in our product development process.”

The Symbol brand is still going strong. On Oct. 11, 11 of the top 25 best-selling men’s formal shirts on Amazon.in carried the Symbol brand name.

‘Systematic campaign of copying’

Amazon has been repeatedly accused in the United States of copying product designs.

In 2018, home-goods retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc filed a federal lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of copying its proprietary designs for chairs, lamps and other products for an Amazon private brand called Rivet.

“Amazon has engaged in a systematic campaign of copying,” the lawsuit alleged. The exhibits filed in the case included pictures of similar-looking products from Amazon and a Williams-Sonoma brand. In court filings, Amazon denied the copying allegations. Last year, the two parties reached a confidential settlement. Both didn’t comment about the case for this story.

Joey Zwillinger, co-founder of Allbirds Inc, a San Francisco-based maker of sustainable footwear and apparel, told Reuters that around 2016 or 2017, Amazon began inviting his company to sell its goods on the e-commerce giant’s platform. Allbirds said no.

Then, in 2019, Amazon introduced a wool-blend sneaker that closely resembled a popular Allbirds wool shoe – and sold for much less. Zwillinger said the Amazon product used cheaper material but that the design was so similar, “it’s hard to tell the difference in a silhouette.”

Allbirds didn’t sue. There are always subtle differences in designs, and copycat cases can be time-consuming, Zwillinger said. But he and Allbirds’ other co-founder posted online a letter to Bezos, noting that the Amazon product was “strikingly similar to our Wool Runner” sneaker. Writing that Allbirds was “flattered at the similarities,” they offered to help Amazon use more sustainable materials in its product.

Zwillinger told Reuters that they didn’t receive a response. Amazon had no comment.

In India, Amazon didn’t just knock off products for itself. One of its employees suggested that another seller consider replicating a company’s products.

In 2020, Amazon India employee Aditi Singh advised Mohit Anand, who was then selling products on Amazon.in, on how he could succeed on the platform. She suggested that Anand “replicate” a furniture company’s products, according to a recording of a phone call reviewed by Reuters.

Noting that an Indian furniture brand called DeckUp was selling well on Amazon.in, Singh suggested that if Anand were to “replicate DeckUp’s range” and charge lower prices, then the products “will sell very well” on Amazon.in. Anand told Reuters that he didn’t take the advice.

Utheja Pulluri, DeckUp's founder and a former Amazon India employee, said that as long as the e-commerce giant was “not sharing confidential data on us, I don’t have a problem … This appears to be business guidance, a generic insight.”

Singh referred a Reuters request for comment to Amazon’s public relations team. The company didn’t comment.

‘Search seeding’ and ‘sparkles’

How high products rank when customers search the Amazon website is critical to online sellers’ success. An internal document in 2017 noted that more than half of users’ clicks on search results are for the products listed in the top eight.

Amazon has said its search algorithms don’t favor its private-brand products. Asked during the 2019 congressional hearing whether Amazon alters algorithms to direct consumers to its own goods, associate general counsel Nate Sutton replied: “The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.”

Yet the internal Amazon documents show that in India, Amazon manipulated search results to favor its own products.

The company used a technique called “search seeding” to boost the rankings of its AmazonBasics and Solimo brand goods, according to the 2016 private-brand report. Referring to Amazon’s product codes – known as ASINs, or Amazon Standard Identification Numbers – the report stated: “We used search seeding for newly launched ASINs to ensure that they feature in the first 2 or three ASINs in search results.”

The document also referred to another technique that gave Amazon an edge: “search sparkles.”

“We have aggressively used search sparkles on PC, Mobile and App to specifically promote Solimo products on relevant customer searches from ‘All Product Search’ and Category search,” the 2016 private-brand report said.

According to one current and two former Amazon employees, search seeding and search sparkles are digital techniques the company has used to direct customers to certain products.

Two of the sources said Amazon has used seeding to alter search rankings to boost products, such as new ones, whose sales are so low that there’s insufficient data for the company’s technology to rank them. Sparkles are banners that Amazon has planted above search results to direct customers to certain products the company wants to promote.

While such tools have legitimate uses to assist online shoppers find certain hot new products, using search seeding to boost the rankings of Amazon’s own products hurts rival merchants’ sales on the platform, one of the former employees said.

Search seeding and sparkles were both used to promote AmazonBasics products on the company’s India platform, the 2016 document reveals. Within months of the launch of AmazonBasics in India in 2015, four of its products were “#1 Bestsellers in their category week after week,” the 2016 document said. It added that “promos” were placed on “detail pages of competitor products to direct traffic to AmazonBasics brands products.”

Piyush Tulsian, a New Delhi retailer of computer accessories, told Reuters he used to earn about $1,500 a month selling mouse pads on Amazon.in made by Logitech International, which is headquartered in Switzerland.

Then, about two years ago, he said he started noticing that his sales were dropping. He said he discovered that customers who viewed details about the Logitech mouse pad he was selling for $21 were shown an advertisement for an AmazonBasics pad that was about 60% cheaper. The Logitech product also began appearing much lower in search results, he said.

“It’s very frustrating,” said Tulsian, who is 36. “They are mistreating sellers.” He said he stopped selling the Logitech mouse pad on Amazon.in and was stuck with 150 unsold ones.

Amazon had no comment. Logitech declined to comment.

Controversy over the business practices of foreign e-commerce companies in India has heated up in recent months. In June, the government proposed draft regulations that threaten to impose further restrictions on Amazon and other e-commerce companies, including local players, after receiving complaints by consumers and traders of unfair business practices. The proposed rules could restrict Amazon and others from selling their own private-brand products in India.

Later that month, India’s commerce minister accused large e-commerce companies of flouting local laws and said he had observed “a little bit of arrogance,” particularly by American ones. The other big platform in India is Flipkart, owned by American retail giant Walmart Inc. Flipkart didn’t comment.

In early July, Amazon announced it would introduce to India a program it already offers businesses elsewhere. Called the “Intellectual Property Accelerator” program, it gives certain sellers on Amazon.in access to services provided by intellectual-property experts and law firms.

One aim, Amazon said, is to help sellers “protect their brands.”

Companies Amazon.com Inc See all The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page.

NEW DELHI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has been repeatedly accused of knocking off products it sells on its website and of exploiting its vast trove of internal data to promote its own merchandise at the expense of other sellers. The company has denied the accusations.

But thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by Reuters – including emails, strategy papers and business plans – show the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India, one of the company's largest growth markets.

The documents reveal how Amazon's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from Amazon.in to copy products sold by other companies, and then offered them on its platform. The employees also stoked sales of Amazon private-brand products by rigging Amazon's search results so that the company's products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report for India put it, ""in the first 2 or three … search results"" when customers were shopping on Amazon.in.

Among the victims of the strategy: a popular shirt brand in India, John Miller, which is owned by a company whose chief executive is Kishore Biyani, known as the country's ""retail king."" Amazon decided to ""follow the measurements of"" John Miller shirts down to the neck circumference and sleeve length, the document states.

The internal documents also show that Amazon employees studied proprietary data about other brands on Amazon.in, including detailed information about customer returns. The aim: to identify and target goods - described as ""reference"" or ""benchmark"" products - and ""replicate"" them. As part of that effort, the 2016 internal report laid out Amazon's strategy for a brand the company originally created for the Indian market called ""Solimo."" The Solimo strategy, it said, was simple: ""use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.""

The Solimo project in India has had international impact: Scores of Solimo-branded health and household products are now offered for sale on Amazon's U.S. website, Amazon.com.

The 2016 document further shows that Amazon employees working on the company's own products, known as private brands or private labels, planned to partner with the manufacturers of the products targeted for copying. That's because they learned that these manufacturers employ ""unique processes which impact the end quality of the product.""

The document, entitled ""India Private Brands Program,"" states: ""It is difficult to develop this expertise across products and hence, to ensure that we are able to fully match quality with our reference product, we decided to only partner with the manufacturers of our reference product."" It termed such manufacturer expertise ""Tribal Knowledge.""

This is the second in a series of stories based on internal Amazon documents that provide a rare, unvarnished look, in the company's own words, into business practices that it has denied for years.

Amazon has been accused before by employees who worked on private-brand products of exploiting proprietary data from individual sellers to launch competing products and manipulating search results to increase sales of the company's own goods.

In sworn testimony before the U.S. Congress in 2020, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos explained that the e-commerce giant prohibits its employees from using the data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. And, in 2019, another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favor them.

But the internal documents seen by Reuters show for the first time that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods, were part of a formal, clandestine strategy at Amazon – and that high-level executives were told about it. The documents show that two executives reviewed the India strategy – senior vice presidents Diego Piacentini, who has since left the company, and Russell Grandinetti, who currently runs Amazon's international consumer business.

In a written response to questions for this report, Amazon said: ""As Reuters hasn't shared the documents or their provenance with us, we are unable to confirm the veracity or otherwise of the information and claims as stated. We believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated."" The company did not elaborate. The statement also did not address questions from Reuters about the evidence in the documents that Amazon employees copied other companies' products for its own brands.

The company said the way it displays search results doesn't favor private-brand products. ""We display search results based on relevance to the customer's search query, irrespective of whether such products have private brands offered by sellers or not,"" Amazon said.

Amazon also said that it ""strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data for the benefit of any seller, including sellers of private brands,"" and that it investigates reports of its employees violating that policy.

Piacentini and Grandinetti didn't respond to requests for comment.

The unfiltered insight the documents offer into Amazon's aggressive use of its market power could intensify the legal and regulatory pressure the company is facing in many countries.

Amazon is under investigation in the United States, Europe and India for alleged anti-competitive practices that hurt other businesses. In India, the allegations include unfairly favoring its own branded merchandise. Amazon declined to comment on the investigations.

Jonas Koponen, an antitrust attorney with Linklaters LLP in Brussels, said the Reuters findings on Amazon's practices in India would likely interest the European Commission, which is probing whether the company has used non-public seller data to boost its own retail business. India has cooperation agreements with the United States and the European Commission to exchange information related to enforcement of antitrust laws.

""When any one competition authority is looking into aspects of one of these globally present organizations' behavior, they will certainly be interested in understanding what evidence there is in other parts of the world and the extent to which that evidence relates to the practices that they themselves are investigating,"" Koponen said.

The documents also support criticism of Amazon laid out by Lina Khan, the new chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Khan published a paper in 2017 that argued that Amazon's private-brand business raised anti-competitive concerns.

""It is third-party sellers who bear the initial costs and uncertainties when introducing new products; by merely spotting them, Amazon gets to sell products only once their success has been tested,"" she wrote. ""The anticompetitive implications here seem clear.""

Amazon filed a petition in June with the FTC asking that Khan recuse herself from all matters related to the company because of ""her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws.""

Khan and the FTC didn't respond to requests for comment.

In the first article in this series, Reuters reported in February that Amazon had for years given preferential treatment to a few big sellers on its Indian platform, and used those sellers to circumvent regulations designed to protect the country's small retailers. That report triggered action by India's main financial crime-fighting agency, which sought information and documents from Amazon. In addition, the nation's antitrust watchdog submitted the story as an exhibit in a court battle with Amazon over its investigation into the company's alleged anti-competitive practices. The court rejected Amazon's request to halt the probe.

""We are committed to extending cooperation to all authorities in India and are confident about our compliance,"" Amazon said in its statement to Reuters.

Like many other retailers, Amazon views its own brands as a major driver of increased profitability. Private-brand products often have higher profit margins than normal retail brands because production and marketing costs can be lower.

An internal email sent by Amazon executive Grandinetti to a group of company executives in December 2018 stated: ""We believe that over the next several years, Private Brands will be one of the most important growth and profitability drivers in the Consumer business."" Grandinetti added that company executives believed private brands ""can achieve 10% penetration"" of the company's consumer business worldwide over the next five years.

Introducing Amazon's own brands was especially critical in India. The company began its e-commerce foray there in 2013, and soon recorded millions of dollars in losses, one internal document shows. To make the business ""sustainable in the long run,"" the 2016 Private Brands document notes, Amazon embarked on a strategy centered on introducing its existing private brands, such as AmazonBasics, and new ones tailored to India.

The 2016 document stated a goal: offer Amazon's own goods in 20% to 40% of all product categories on Amazon.in within two years. Amazon would achieve profitability in its private-brand business by ""only launching products that will provide more margin than comparable reference brand products.""

Amazon predicted private-brand sales would reach nearly $600 million by 2020 in India, according to a 2017 internal business strategy document. ""We will be amongst the Top 3 brands in each sub-category that we play in,"" the document stated.

Whether it achieved that sales goal isn't clear; Amazon doesn't disclose its private-brand sales in India. The company didn't comment on the strategic goals and other details from the documents reported in this article.

An Amazon press release in 2018 revealed just how successful its private-brand business was becoming in India. Celebrating ""record sales"" during an annual promotion, the release stated, ""Amazon Brands saw its best performance ever with 11X jump over last Great Indian Festival.""

Today, Amazon.in lists thousands of Amazon-branded offerings – from garbage bags, bed sheets and soap to air conditioners and televisions. According to the website, many are best-sellers.

One key person involved in 2016 with Amazon's private-brand business in India was Amit Nanda, who later became a country director of the program, according to his LinkedIn profile. He holds an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, one of the nation's top business schools. Before joining Amazon in 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile, he worked at Citibank and the Indian arm of consumer-goods giant Unilever.

As Amazon was reviewing its private-brand strategy in India in 2016, Amazon India employees had a meeting with Grandinetti. A longtime Amazon manager, at the time he was in charge of content for Kindle, the company's popular reading device. But Amazon had announced that he would soon lead its international consumer business, including India.

During the meeting, Nanda was assigned various tasks, according to one Amazon document. Among them: The India private brands ""business should be large and profitable. Build for scale.""

Nanda declined to comment for this story.

'GLANCE VIEWS'

With its population of 1.3 billion people and a growing middle class, India represents a huge and potentially lucrative market for Amazon. But it's also a country where foreign e-commerce players face a complex and protectionist regulatory regime.

The country's brick-and-mortar retailers comprise an important political constituency for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Concerned that predatory pricing could hurt these merchants, India prohibits foreign e-commerce players from selling most goods directly to consumers, as they do in many other countries. Amazon and other foreign companies are restricted to operating an online marketplace of third-party sellers, with no one vendor allowed to hold an advantage over another. As a result, Amazon sells most of its private brands through other vendors.

In launching its private-brand business, internal documents show how Amazon used its Indian website to gain a clear edge for its own products on the platform. The creation of its Solimo brand offers a case study.

According to the internal documents, the word Solimo is derived from Solimões - the name for the upper stretches of the Amazon River in Brazil.

With the Solimo line, Amazon aimed to offer items that equaled or exceeded the quality of competing brands but were 10% to 15% cheaper, the 2016 Private Brands document shows. Amazon employees studied different product categories, and compared their overall market size with how well those segments were doing on Amazon.in. They then targeted categories such as home furnishings. Amazon found that furnishings was a $2 billion business in India - but its own website's three-month sales in mid-2014 totaled about $1 million.

In its analysis, Amazon used a metric called ""glance views"" that quantified which products were being viewed by customers on its website. Explaining why it zeroed in on glance views, the 2016 Amazon document noted that monitoring its India website traffic provides ""an opportunity to influence interested customers who are actively considering"" a purchase in a product category.

Amazon has said some of the data its private-brand teams use in launching products is public – such as the website's rankings of best-selling merchandise. This is how Amazon described the system to a U.S. congressional subcommittee last year: ""Like anyone else at Amazon or in the general public, members of these teams can also visit Amazon's product detail pages to learn a product's best seller ranking and read customer reviews and star ratings to assess whether a product is selling well in Amazon's store.""

But seven current and former Indian sellers on Amazon.in told Reuters they can't access internal sales data of rival brands offered on the website. Four of the sellers said they can access glance views, but only for their own products. Amazon has access to more data on sellers, including the number of product units shipped and details about customer returns, the 2016 document shows, giving it an advantage in market intelligence.

Amazon's own use of the data to develop and promote its private-brand products ""destroys the level playing field,"" said one current seller, who asked to remain anonymous.

Amazon said in its statement that it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace."" The company also said it ""identifies selection gaps based on customer preferences at an aggregate level only and shares this information with all sellers.""

HOW TO 'REPLICATE' PRODUCTS

Once Amazon's private-brand employees had decided which categories to enter, they reviewed sales and customer-review data on Amazon.in to identify ""reference"" or ""benchmark"" brands to ""replicate,"" the 2016 private-brand document showed.

In the case of Solimo, the 2016 document stated that to ensure the brand's goods meet ""customer requirements in terms of performance we identify and replicate these reference products."" Amazon had no comment on the Solimo project.

Amazon's strategy also called for manufacturers of its private-brand products to use other companies' goods as models to develop samples for pre-production testing.

Among the brands Amazon employees planned to ""benchmark,"" the document states, were American ones – ""Old Navy/GAP"" men's shirts. The document does not indicate whether the employees followed through.

Gap Inc, which owns the Old Navy and Gap brands, declined to comment.

The rival products Amazon targeted also included other brands popular in India. For pots and pans, a ""reference brand"" was Prestige, one of India's largest kitchen-equipment companies. For men's shirts, the benchmarks included Peter England and Louis Philippe, both made in India by conglomerate Aditya Birla Group.

Amazon also targeted John Players, a menswear brand then owned by Indian conglomerate ITC Ltd.

Chandru Kalro, managing director of TTK Prestige, which owns the Prestige brand in India, told Reuters, ""We have no knowledge of us being a 'reference brand' for Amazon and we don't know what it means to be an Amazon reference brand.""

Aditya Birla Group declined to comment. ITC did not respond to a request for comment.

In early 2016, Amazon private-brand employees were internally noting the success of Xessentia, a clothing brand they had launched on Amazon.in in partnership with a seller. The seller owned the brand; Amazon designed the products.

Sales of Xessentia men's business shirts were surging, and in the first quarter of 2016 had become that category's second-most popular brand on the India site after the American brand Arrow, licensed to the Indian company Arvind Fashions. To create the Xessentia line, Amazon had used Louis Philippe as the benchmark brand, because it was ""premium and popular,"" the 2016 document said.

But something was amiss: About one in every 12 Xessentia shirts was being returned in the first quarter of 2016 for sizing issues. More than 350 were returned because customers complained they were too small.

Amazon employees conducted a ""deep dive,"" the 2016 document reports, by poring over a year's worth of data from Amazon.in, including customer complaints and return numbers for Xessentia, Arrow and seven other brands. They found that a brand of men's business shirts in India called John Miller had far outsold Xessentia shirts, despite carrying ""a similar"" average selling price. John Miller also had about half the rate of customer returns for ""quality issues.""

The upshot: ""Our learning is that our customer is different from the Louis Philippe customer and doesn't prefer this fit,"" the 2016 document stated. ""We concluded to follow the measurements of Business Shirt of John Miller for Xessentia because of wide acceptance with our customer base.""

So Amazon revised the fit of Xessentia shirts to copy John Miller's sizing, matching it down to the neck, shoulder, armhole, sleeve and waist dimensions.

Amazon didn't reply to questions about its Xessentia project. Arvind Fashions declined to comment.

John Miller is a brand owned by retail mogul Kishore Biyani. Amazon and Biyani later became business partners in India, but had a falling out. Amazon is now embroiled in a legal battle with Biyani over the proposed sale of his retail assets to Reliance, which is run by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, considered India's wealthiest man. Ambani and Amazon are fierce rivals, with the Indian magnate in recent years launching his own e-commerce business.

A spokesperson for Biyani's Future Group said the company was ""shocked and surprised"" to learn that Amazon was using Indian brands to build its own. ""They are in a powerful position of being both an online marketplace operator and a seller and collector of data,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. ""This is leading to misuse of consumer and seller data giving them the power to kill Indian entrepreneurs and their brands.""

After the launch of Xessentia, Amazon introduced a brand of U.S.-and-European-style clothes in India called Symbol.

""For every product line identified for launch, we will identify an optimal reference brand based on customer reviews and size of business,"" state the plans for Symbol and another private brand. ""The replication of the 'Fit' of this reference brand will be a crucial step in our product development process.""

The Symbol brand is still going strong. On Oct. 11, 11 of the top 25 best-selling men's formal shirts on Amazon.in carried the Symbol brand name.

'SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN OF COPYING'

Amazon has been repeatedly accused in the United States of copying product designs.

In 2018, home-goods retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc filed a federal lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of copying its proprietary designs for chairs, lamps and other products for an Amazon private brand called Rivet.

""Amazon has engaged in a systematic campaign of copying,"" the lawsuit alleged. The exhibits filed in the case included pictures of similar-looking products from Amazon and a Williams-Sonoma brand. In court filings, Amazon denied the copying allegations. Last year, the two parties reached a confidential settlement. Both didn't comment about the case for this story.

Joey Zwillinger, co-founder of Allbirds Inc, a San Francisco-based maker of sustainable footwear and apparel, told Reuters that around 2016 or 2017, Amazon began inviting his company to sell its goods on the e-commerce giant's platform. Allbirds said no.

Then, in 2019, Amazon introduced a wool-blend sneaker that closely resembled a popular Allbirds wool shoe – and sold for much less. Zwillinger said the Amazon product used cheaper material but that the design was so similar, ""it's hard to tell the difference in a silhouette.""

Allbirds didn't sue. There are always subtle differences in designs, and copycat cases can be time-consuming, Zwillinger said. But he and Allbirds' other co-founder posted online a letter to Bezos, noting that the Amazon product was ""strikingly similar to our Wool Runner"" sneaker. Writing that Allbirds was ""flattered at the similarities,"" they offered to help Amazon use more sustainable materials in its product.

Zwillinger told Reuters that they didn't receive a response. Amazon had no comment.

In India, Amazon didn't just knock off products for itself. One of its employees suggested that another seller consider replicating a company's products.

In 2020, Amazon India employee Aditi Singh advised Mohit Anand, who was then selling products on Amazon.in, on how he could succeed on the platform. She suggested that Anand ""replicate"" a furniture company's products, according to a recording of a phone call reviewed by Reuters.

Noting that an Indian furniture brand called DeckUp was selling well on Amazon.in, Singh suggested that if Anand were to ""replicate DeckUp's range"" and charge lower prices, then the products ""will sell very well"" on Amazon.in. Anand told Reuters that he didn't take the advice.

Utheja Pulluri, DeckUp's founder and a former Amazon India employee, said that as long as the e-commerce giant was ""not sharing confidential data on us, I don't have a problem … This appears to be business guidance, a generic insight.""

Singh referred a Reuters request for comment to Amazon's public relations team. The company didn't comment.

'SEARCH SEEDING' AND 'SPARKLES'

How high products rank when customers search the Amazon website is critical to online sellers' success. An internal document in 2017 noted that more than half of users' clicks on search results are for the products listed in the top eight.

Amazon has said its search algorithms don't favor its private-brand products. Asked during the 2019 congressional hearing whether Amazon alters algorithms to direct consumers to its own goods, associate general counsel Nate Sutton replied: ""The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.""

Yet the internal Amazon documents show that in India, Amazon manipulated search results to favor its own products.

The company used a technique called ""search seeding"" to boost the rankings of its AmazonBasics and Solimo brand goods, according to the 2016 private-brand report. Referring to Amazon's product codes – known as ASINs, or Amazon Standard Identification Numbers – the report stated: ""We used search seeding for newly launched ASINs to ensure that they feature in the first 2 or three ASINs in search results.""

The document also referred to another technique that gave Amazon an edge: ""search sparkles.""

""We have aggressively used search sparkles on PC, Mobile and App to specifically promote Solimo products on relevant customer searches from 'All Product Search' and Category search,"" the 2016 private-brand report said.

According to one current and two former Amazon employees, search seeding and search sparkles are digital techniques the company has used to direct customers to certain products.

Two of the sources said Amazon has used seeding to alter search rankings to boost products, such as new ones, whose sales are so low that there's insufficient data for the company's technology to rank them. Sparkles are banners that Amazon has planted above search results to direct customers to certain products the company wants to promote.

While such tools have legitimate uses to assist online shoppers find certain hot new products, using search seeding to boost the rankings of Amazon's own products hurts rival merchants' sales on the platform, one of the former employees said.

Search seeding and sparkles were both used to promote AmazonBasics products on the company's India platform, the 2016 document reveals. Within months of the launch of AmazonBasics in India in 2015, four of its products were ""#1 Bestsellers in their category week after week,"" the 2016 document said. It added that ""promos"" were placed on ""detail pages of competitor products to direct traffic to AmazonBasics brands products.""

Piyush Tulsian, a New Delhi retailer of computer accessories, told Reuters he used to earn about $1,500 a month selling mouse pads on Amazon.in made by Logitech International, which is headquartered in Switzerland.

Then, about two years ago, he said he started noticing that his sales were dropping. He said he discovered that customers who viewed details about the Logitech mouse pad he was selling for $21 were shown an advertisement for an AmazonBasics pad that was about 60% cheaper. The Logitech product also began appearing much lower in search results, he said.

""It's very frustrating,"" said Tulsian, who is 36. ""They are mistreating sellers."" He said he stopped selling the Logitech mouse pad on Amazon.in and was stuck with 150 unsold ones.

Amazon had no comment. Logitech declined to comment.

Controversy over the business practices of foreign e-commerce companies in India has heated up in recent months. In June, the government proposed draft regulations that threaten to impose further restrictions on Amazon and other e-commerce companies, including local players, after receiving complaints by consumers and traders of unfair business practices. The proposed rules could restrict Amazon and others from selling their own private-brand products in India.

Later that month, India's commerce minister accused large e-commerce companies of flouting local laws and said he had observed ""a little bit of arrogance,"" particularly by American ones. The other big platform in India is Flipkart, owned by American retail giant Walmart Inc. Flipkart didn't comment.

In early July, Amazon announced it would introduce to India a program it already offers businesses elsewhere. Called the ""Intellectual Property Accelerator"" program, it gives certain sellers on Amazon.in access to services provided by intellectual-property experts and law firms.

One aim, Amazon said, is to help sellers ""protect their brands.""",13/10/2021,Citibank,"Celebrating ""record sales"" during an annual promotion, the release stated, ""Amazon Brands saw its best performance ever with 11X jump over last Great Indian Festival.""

NewsApi.org,"I receive compensation for content and many links on this blog. Citibank is an advertising partner of this site, as is American Express, Chase, Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles, points, and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

Citibank has added Choice Privileges as a points transfer partner, at better than 1:1. I value Choice points at around $0.006 apiece, so transferring at 1:2 isn’t unreasonable. In fact, it’s better than you’ll do with most bank transferable currencies moving points to hotels (other than moving points to Hyatt). And it’s possible to get over a penny apiece in value from a Choice point, so there’s certainly a strategic use for moving one Citi point into two Choice points.

The Citi Premier® Card has its biggest-ever initial bonus to earn 80,000 bonus points after $4,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening.

Earning on this $95 annual fee card is 3 points per dollar spent at restaurants; supermarkets; gas stations; air travel; and hotels. That’s a broad set of categories for triple points-earning. I could see, then, getting 6 cents per dollar spent in value from a Choice transfer.

Points can be transferred to a variety of frequent flyer programs, now including:

SkyTeam: Aeromexico Club Premier, Air France KLM Flying Blue

Aeromexico Club Premier, Air France KLM Flying Blue oneworld: Cathay Pacific Asia Miles, Malaysia Airlines Enrich, Qantas Frequent Flyer, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, American Airlines AAdvantage (through November 13, 2021)*

Cathay Pacific Asia Miles, Malaysia Airlines Enrich, Qantas Frequent Flyer, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, American Airlines AAdvantage (through November 13, 2021)* Star Alliance: Avianca LifeMiles, EVA Air Infinity MileageLands, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus, Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles

Avianca LifeMiles, EVA Air Infinity MileageLands, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus, Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles Non-alliance: Emirates Skywards, Etihad Guest, JetBlue TrueBlue, Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Emirates Skywards, Etihad Guest, JetBlue TrueBlue, Virgin Atlantic Flying Club Hotels: Choice Privileges

Citi lost Hilton as a points transfer partner when Hilton went exclusive in its co-brand relationship with American Express. Choice gives it a hotel transfer partner, and one I value more than American Express transfers to Hilton (because in my view one Choice point is worth more than one Hilton point).

While some of the best deals with Choice will be found at inexpensive hotels costing few points, they have more aspirational redemptions such as in the Ascend Hotel Collection that are often overlooked.

Since Citi Prestige is no longer available for new cardmembers. the Citi Premier® Card is Citi’s primary competitor in the transferable points space, and they’vee ramping up their investment in attracting new customers. 80,000 points is a compelling reason to get the card.

And the transfer partners are strong and in some cases quite unique. Qatar’s Privilege Club has really improved and is compelling especially for QSuites redemptions.

While Virgin Atlantic miles are often less valuable than other currencies they have incredible sweet spots.

Turkish Airlines offers 48 hour award holds so you can lock in an award prior to transferring points. Cancel and redposit fee is just $25. First class to the Caribbean or Hawaii is just 12,500 miles one-way on United. Europe is just 45,000 miles in business class, and India 52,500 miles (plus fuel surcharges).

Singapore Airlines is great for booking awards on Singapore flights themselves in long haul premium cabins. Meanwhile EVA Airways has a really underappreciated program as well.

This card pairs really well with a no annual fee Citi Custom CashSM Card which offers 5% return in specific categories that change each month based on what you’re spending the most on. You can move the points into your Citi Premier® Card account and transfer them to frequent flyer programs.

With the Citi Custom CashSM Card your 5x category will be the one you spend the most in out of restaurants; gas stations; grocery stores; select travel and transit; select streaming services; drugstores; home improvement stores; fitness clubs; live entertainment.

Oct 25 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) on Monday warned of significant charges related to the closing of its consumer banking business in South Korea, months after announcing its exit from 13 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

The Wall Street lender's plan is part of Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser's turnaround strategy to bring the bank's profitability and share price in line with its peers.

The charges will largely comprise payouts to employees related to voluntary termination benefits, discussions for which have already started with employee unions, Citigroup said, adding the charges will be spread across till the end of 2023.

The bank said it was, however, unable to estimate the charge it will take.

Besides South Korea, the bank will also divest its retail banking arms in Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, it said in April.

In November of 2020, Google announced it would be offering mobile-optimized bank accounts, called “Plex” accounts, in partnership with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union. Now the company is pulling back on its plan, saying logistical setbacks and the departure of its executive sponsor are to blame.

Plex accounts were originally intended to be simplified bank accounts focused on the mobile experience. Users would be able to sync the account with Google Pay and wouldn’t be subjected to monthly or overdraft fees. In an effort to improve financial literacy and wellness, Google planned on implementing a budgeting dashboard that helped users understand how they spent and saved their money. It was the company’s next stab at truly on-the-go banking, popularized most recently by its own mobile payment system, as well as by Apple Pay and Apple Card.

“[We are] looking to make banking more relevant for the mobile-first generation,” said former Google vice president and general manager of Google Payments Caesar Sengupta last year. At the time, Sengupta spearheaded the Plex project and led the company’s Next Billion Users initiative, which seeks to make the internet more accessible to people worldwide. Google was on track to begin opening accounts in 2021, after which it would begin offering users the opportunity to sign up for a custom debit card, run by Mastercard.

But like with everything else, COVID-19 threw a wrench in Google’s plans, resulting in several Plex delays and missed deadlines. Sengupta left Google earlier this year to start his own financial tech company, Arbo Works (and brought a handful of his Google colleagues with him). Though former Paypal executive and current Google President of Commerce Bill Ready took over Plex, the project’s spark seemingly left with Sengupta.

A Google spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that the company would be shifting toward “delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than [Google] serving as the provider of these services.” While Citibank and Stanford Federal Credit Union already have mobile apps, Google may wish to focus on smaller institutions that haven’t so easily been able to keep up with the times. Still, the news is likely disappointing to the 400,000 users who have added themselves to Plex’s waitlist since last year.

ONLINE TEST: Criteria: CPI 6+ and no active backlogs

Test consisted of 5 sections. There were sectional timers. You cannot switch between sections. Also you cannot navigate through the questions within a section. There was no negative marking. It was video proctored.

General tip: Be real quick while solving questions!

1. CS subjects’ based MCQs (25 Questions in 35 minutes)

MCQs based on stacks, queues, trees, searching, sorting techniques, output prediction, basic programming questions, OOPS etc

Your basics should be really clear and you will be through this section.

2. Aptitude (16 Questions in 16 minutes)

MCQs on topics like work and time, probability, permutations and combinations, percentages, ages, profit and loss, etc. I don’t remember exactly what the questions were, but they were doable.

The only thing is you need to be fast.

3. Logical Reasoning (14 Questions in 14 minutes)

I don’t clearly remember the questions of this section.

But the questions were of easy to moderate level.

4. Verbal Reasoning (22 Questions in 18 minutes)

Antonyms, synonyms, prepositions and passages etc. The questions were easy.

Tip: There were two passages. Each passage had around 3-4 questions.

So reading the passage carefully once helps a lot.

a. Trapezium Pattern Printing. Passed 11/11 test cases

b. Rat in a maze

I followed a backtracking approach and I managed to pass 25/32 test cases

40 students were shortlisted for the interviews

ROUND 2(TECHNICAL INTERVIEW): Duration: 20 minutes (on zoom)

The interviewer was really friendly and he began the interview by introducing himself. Then he asked “Tell me about yourself”. He looked quite impressed with my introduction and he spent around 1-2 minutes describing what he liked about my introduction. This made me feel quite comfortable.

He had my resume and asked me how much would I rate myself in Java on the scale of 10 (as I had java on my resume) to which I replied 6/10

Then he asked me the following questions

Abstraction can be achieved by both interfaces and abstract classes. What is the difference between interfaces and abstract classes? Which one is preferable? Can static members be inherited? When a protected member of the base class is inherited what will be the access modifier of that member in the derived class? Volatile keyword in java (This I could not answer and I clearly stated that I was not aware of this. He said no problem)

After this he asked me about HTML (mentioned on my resume), He asked me what HTML is and what all I have learnt in HTML.

Next he asked what happens when you enter something in a text field on a website.

Then he moved on to my project and asked me to describe my project. I used the STAR approach to explain my project. He was happy with my explanation.

Next, he asked me about the data structures that I am proficient in. I replied to arrays, strings, trees, linked list, stacks, queues.

Then he asked me a coding question : nth node from end of a linked list

I gave him two approaches(better and optimal) and he was satisfied. He did not ask me to code.

At the end he asked whether I had any questions for him (Always ask questions! It shows your interest in the company)

I asked him two questions and his replies were full of advice and his experiences.

26 students were shortlisted for the next Round

ROUND 2(HR ROUND): Duration: 30 minutes (on zoom)

Tip: Be confident and be yourself!

The HR gave her introduction and then asked the following questions

Tell me about yourself and your family What are your weaknesses? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Do you like to work in a team or individually? Have you worked on a group project? How was your experience and what did you learn? Why do you want to intern with Citi?

Finally, 10 students were shortlisted for the internship and I was one of them!

NewsApi.org,"New tie-up offers Citi credit card customers greater flexibility and convenience in redeeming Citi ThankYou Points or Citi Miles for GrabRewards points

SINGAPORE, Oct. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Citi, the largest pan-regional credit card issuer, and Grab, a leading superapp in Southeast Asia, are providing Citi cardmembers in Singapore with more options to maximise the value of their Citi ThankYou Points or Citi Miles.

Citi Logo (PRNewsfoto/Citi)

Starting today, Citi cardmembers will have a new channel to instantly convert their existing Citi ThankYou Points or Citi Miles to GrabRewards points. This tie-up was partly in response to Citi cardmembers' feedback on wanting more rewards redemption options. The partnership allows Citi card customers more flexibility to redeem their Citi ThankYou Points or Citi Miles for ride or delivery vouchers from the GrabRewards catalogue, offset in-store purchases, and participate in fun seasonal activities. This can be done seamlessly with no conversion fees imposed.

The programme follows a longstanding partnership between Citi and Grab in the region, with the most recent being a cards tie-up in Thailand in August 2021. This partnership is made possible via API integration, allowing a secure and easy way for Citi cardmembers to make instant rewards conversion on a partner's digital e-commerce site or app, using secured API developed, controlled and owned by Citi.



Serene Gay, Citibank Singapore Head of Credit Cards and Personal Loans, said: ""At Citibank, we greatly value our customer experience, and seek to make it more convenient and rewarding for them to use our cards. Thus, we are delighted to be the first credit card issuer in Singapore to offer this innovative tie-up with Grab which will offer more flexibility and value to our cardmembers through combining a strategic partnership with the use of technology.""

Lim Kell Jay, Head of Grab Financial Group, Singapore said: ""As consumers become savvier about earning rewards with their digital payments, we are always seeking ways to enhance our users' GrabPay experience by providing greater value and rewards with every transaction. By teaming up with Citibank, consumers who are both GrabPay and Citi Card users can now have the flexibility to convert their Citi ThankYou Points or Citi Miles for everyday use on the Grab platform.""

NewsApi.org,"Citibank recently added the ability to transfer ThankYou Rewards points to Choice Privileges at an excellent 1 to 2 rate. 1,000 Citi points becomes 2,000 Choice points. This is great for Choice Hotels stays. They even have some high end Ascend Collection hotels that offer excellent value (the Hotel Napa Valley and the Peacock Inn in Princeton, NJ are ones that Nick and I, respectively, have booked in the past). Venturing outside of Choice’s own hotels, though, it’s possible to go really high end thanks to their partnership with Preferred Hotels & Resorts.

The only problem with this option is that booking a Preferred Hotel with Choice points is an extremely frustrating experience. More about that later. Hopefully as more and more of us book these properties, Choice will smooth out the process.

Great value is now possible

Preferred Hotels & Resorts is a collection of over 650 high-end independent hotels around the world. Not all Preferred Hotels are bookable with Choice Privileges points, but many are (349 at the time of writing). Point prices range from 25,000 to 55,000 points per night. Given the 1 to 2 transfer ratio, this translates to only 12,500 to 27,500 Citi ThankYou points per night. If you think of it as being similar to an award chart, that’s fantastic. Among the major hotel chains, only Hyatt offers an award chart that’s competitive (Hyatt has a few award charts, but their primary chart ranges up to 40,000 points with the vast majority of those hotels at 30,000 points or lower).

Prior to Citi offering 1 to 2 transfers to Choice, the best options for acquiring Choice points quickly were to transfer from Amex Membership Rewards 1 to 1, or to buy points indirectly at 8/10ths of a cent each. At those rates, my previous looks at the Preferred Hotels & Resorts partnership showed that while good value was sometimes possible, most of the time the value was poor. Citi has changed that equation…

Value Examples

Below are a handful of examples of Preferred Hotels bookable with Choice points and the value I found for specific upcoming dates. As you’ll see, I found that Choice point values in these examples ranged from 0.76 to 1.05 cents per point. That’s decent value on its own, but not amazing. I certainly wouldn’t want to transfer Amex Membership Rewards points to get that value. But with Citi offering a 1 to 2 transfer ratio, the value of Citi points in these examples ranges from 1.5 to 2.1 cents per point. That’s very good!

The Brown Hotel, Louisville, KY

Dec 3 to 5: $400 after taxes and fees.

Choice points: 25K x 2 = 50,000 (0.8 cents per point value)

ThankYou points: 25,000 (1.6 cents per point value)

The Kahala Hotel and Resort

Dec 10 to 12: $1,161 after taxes and fees

Choice points: 55K x 2 = 110,000 (1.05 cents per point value)

ThankYou points: 55,000 (2.1 cents per point value)

Balboa Bay Resort, Newport Beach, California

Dec 10 to 12: $894 after taxes and fees

Choice points: 45K x 2 = 90,000 (0.99 cents per point value)

ThankYou points: 45,000 (1.99 cents per point value)

Hotel Sans Souci

Dec 10 to 12: $841 after taxes and fees

Choice points: 55K x 2 = 110,000 (0.76 cents per point value)

How to book your stay

The Choice website says “To book your stay with Preferred Hotels & Resorts, call 888-770-6800.”

That’s technically true, but believe me when I say that it’s not easy. I started working on a booking shortly after 9 in the morning and it took 3 hours and four phone calls to get it done. Hopefully you can learn from my mistakes and get it done more quickly…

Step 1) When the Choice computer voice asks if you want to book a stay, say “NO!”

I made the mistake of saying yes the first time and I spent nearly an hour on the phone trying to convince a booking agent that he should be able to help me book a particular Preferred Hotels property, and no I don’t want to be transferred to Expedia, please transfer me to a supervisor, no I don’t want to be transferred to the hotel itself, please transfer me to a supervisor, no I don’t want to be transferred to Expedia… I never did get to that supervisor no matter how hard I tried.

Second attempt:

“Would you like to book a stay” No!

“What can I help you with?” Choice Privileges

“I’ll connect you with an agent”

Step 2) Ask agent if they’re familiar with the ability to book Preferred Hotels with Choice points.

If they say no, I recommend asking to be transferred to someone else or hang up and try again.

Step 3) Have lots of patience

I was lucky enough to get an agent who knew about the Choice partnership with Preferred Hotels, but he didn’t know how to book the stay. Here’s an abbreviated version of our conversation:

Agent: “I’ll have to go into another system here…. I’m trying to verify the system.. [mutters] That’s actually a different system… OK what are the dates and location of the stay you want?”

Me: [I give him the details]

Agent: “I will have to contact another department. Let me place you on a brief hold” … [time passes] … “I am trying to contact the other department that handles this. Is it OK if I put you on hold for a while?” … [time passes] … “I just got that info sent to me. Let me place you on hold for a brief moment” … [time passes] … “This is actually a very nice hotel.” …[hums, mutters, and clicks]…”Let me click onto the other line to see if they have it, OK? Just one second” … [time passes] … “They sent me a thing just showing how much it costs, but not the option with points. So I’m trying to see here. It just shows me money value, not points.” … [time passes] … “I need to get into contact with one of my coordinators. OK? She’s looking into that right now. Maybe I have a little glitch in my system. OK? We are going to verify both at the same time. OK? Please allow me to put you on hold. OK?” … [time passes] …”I just got good news for you. If you have points, we can book it right now.”

Me: “What is the cancellation policy?”

Agent: “Good question…” … [time passes] … “Please cancel 72 hours prior to the arrival date.”

Me: “I transferred in the needed points, can we book it now?”

Agent: “I have to transfer call… Please allow me to reach out to them. I’ll have to put you on a brief hold?”

Eventually I was transferred to a supervisor to actually book the stay. The supervisor had similar sounding computer issues as with the first agent. After lots of clicking and muttering, we got to this:

Supervisor: “I need to reboot my system and that will take a while. Can you call back in about 35 minutes?”

Me: “Can you call ME back when you’re ready?”

Supervisor: “OK, I’ll do that”

I was worried about the situation… would he really call me back? Luckily, he actually did call me back only 5 minutes later. The final conversation only took 7 minutes to complete and my stay was finally booked! A few hours later I received a confirmation email. Done!

NewsApi.org,"Citibank recently added the ability to transfer ThankYou Rewards points to Choice Privileges at an excellent 1 to 2 rate. 1,000 Citi points becomes 2,000 Choice points. This makes hotels bookable with Choice points more accessible than ever before. Plus, it makes almost all Choice awards a good deal. Hotels that cost 30,000 Choice points per night, now cost only 15,000 Citi ThankYou points per night.

Separately I looked at luxury options when I posted “The worlds best Preferred Hotels bookable with Choice points.” And I described how difficult these are to book here. Now, I’ve turned my eye towards Choice’s own high-end brand: The Ascend Hotel Collection.

There are a few great things about Choice’s Ascend Collection hotels:

Unlike Preferred Hotels, Ascend Collection hotels can be booked online with points.

Award prices range from 16,000 to 30,000 points per night. That means that you can book these with only 8,000 to 15,000 Citi ThankYou points per night!

Often (but not always), all room types can be booked with points for the same price as a standard room. Sometimes multi-room suites can be booked for the same award price as a standard room.

There are some negatives though:

Choice only allows booking with points within 100 days of your stay.

There is no way to know what the point price will be for stays more than 6 months in advance. The best you can do is go to the hotel’s Choice website, click “Hotel Info”, and look for a section like this: Oct 24, 2021 – Jan 31, 2022: Sun – Thu 30,000/Room Fri – Sat 30,000/Room

Feb 1, 2022 – Apr 15, 2022: Sun – Thu 25,000/Room Fri – Sat 30,000/Room

There’s no easy way to find Ascend Collection hotels. Choice doesn’t offer an online directory. For this post, I made heavy use of freehotelsearch.com/Ascend_Collection-chain.html, but many entries were out of date.

For this post, I searched for Ascend Collection hotels and included them below only if they seemed subjectively desirable in some way and got good online reviews. For each property, I noted my thoughts about it; I listed the point prices for the next 6 months; and I noted whether or not suites could be booked with points.

If you know of good properties that I missed, please let me know!

Canada

Nova Scotia

Greg’s Take: Looks like a nice resort in Nova Scotia!

Award prices: 16K, 20K

Book suites for same point price? No (None available that I could find)

Website quote: “Escape the stress and rush of the city at a relaxing beach resort in Nova Scotia. Surrounded by Fall River’s abundant natural beauty, you’ll feel the wear and tear of daily life fall away as you enjoy gourmet cuisine, rest by our private white sand beach, and stroll along Lake Thomas. Our Nova Scotia luxury resort is also in easy distance of Halifax’s most famous landmarks, including the Halifax Citadel, St. Mary’s Basilica, and the original Alexander Keith’s brewery. Or, if the wilderness calls, you can get lost among the many lakes and rivers of central Nova Scotia.”

Quebec

Greg’s Take: I really enjoyed visiting Quebec City a couple of years ago — it was like going to France without the long flight. This hotel could be a good lodging option, but it’s worth comparing the cash rates to the point prices: often it is cheap enough that you might as well pay and earn points rather than spending them here.

Website quote: “Located just minutes from historic Old Quebec, the Hotel Royal William, an Ascend Collection Hotel Member® offers boutique-style accommodations perfect for a business trip, romantic getaway or family function. One of the foremost luxury hotels in Quebec City since 1831, Hotel Royal William offers an elegant oasis in the hip and trendy St-Roch neighbourhood, where you can enjoy a diverse array or urban eateries, unique stores, as well as exciting nightlife.”

Europe

Greg’s Take: This gem was brought to my attention both by a YouTube commenter on our podcast and via a post on our Frequent Miler Insiders Facebook Group (we welcome new members by the way!). Online reviews of this property are fantastic, and yes, you can book a big suite for the same point price as a regular room! The value of using points here vs. paying cash is incredible.

Website quote: “The modern and chic Hotel Aquarius Venice, Ascend Hotel Collection is located in the desirable Santa Croce district full of stunning architecture, desirable nearby restaurants and top attractions for travellers to this exquisite city. Guests can enjoy the hotel’s warm tones and relax in our interior courtyard or experience the hotel’s secret garden. For unique entree to the city, guests can access Venice via our water door from the canal. The Hotel Aquarius Venice is decorated with contemporary furnishings and appointed with smart elements crafted by local artists and artisans. Start your day with a complimentary hot breakfast before exploring Venice. The hotel is a short walk from the famed Rialto Bridge and Market. You can adore Piazza San Marco and tour the Palazzo Ducale and Basilica di San Marco or commemorate 500 years of Jewish life and rich history in the Jewish Ghetto.

United States

Arizona

Greg’s Take: This looks like it would be a nice home base for hiking around Sedona.

Award prices: 25K, 30K

Book suites for same point price? Yes

Website quote: “Just a short drive from our hotel you’ll discover awe-inspiring destinations like the stunning red sandstone formations of the upper Sonoran Desert, Bell Rock Vortex, Thunder Mountain, Red Rock State Park, Slide Rock State Park and Cathedral Rock. Our boutique hotel situated on Highway 89A is less than 3 miles from downtown Sedona and minutes from Red Rock Crossing and only a 15-minute drive to Oak Creek Canyon. After a day of outdoor exploration or browsing Sedona galleries and shops, retreat to your room to relax and prepare for an evening in Sedona.”

Arkansas

Greg’s Take: I love how unique this property is, and the fact that quite a few suites are available to book for the same point price as a regular room.

Book suites for same point price? Yes

Website quote: “Experience the historic feel and quaint charm of our Springdale hotel.

California

Nick’s take: The Hotel Napa Valley is well-located and can be a good value on points, particularly if you’re able to book one of the suites. Keep in mind though that most of the rooms are in separate buildings behind the main house, so while nice enough it doesn’t quite have the B&B vibe you get from curbside pictures of the main building.

Website quote: “You’ll never run out of fun things to do near our hotel. The dining and tasting rooms of downtown Napa lie just blocks away. La Toque and TORC are some of the nearby favorites. The depot for the Napa Wine Train is close by, making it easy to explore vintages farther afield in St. Helena and Calistoga. Want to try something new? Our friendly staff is eager to help. We offer free WiFi throughout the property and a print station.”

Award prices: 20K, 25K, 30K

Book suites for same point price? No (None available that I could find)

Website quote: “Hotel Petaluma is situated in the midst of Wine Country, home to more than 400 wineries such as Saintsbury, DeLoach Vineyards and Sequoia Grove. Our hotel has its own wine tasting room, Barber Cellars, focusing on small-production, single-vineyard wines from Sonoma Coast and Mountain vineyards. Hotel Petaluma also has its own restaurant, The Shuckery, and a cocktail lounge, Bar 855, a tribute to the 855 men and women of Petaluma who originally financed the hotel.”

Greg’s take: The hotel itself looks fine but not amazing, but the location appears to be fantastic. It’s far enough away from Fisherman’s Warf to be removed from the tourist crowds while being walking distance from some of San Francisco’s treasures: The Presidio begins a half mile to the west. Same with the Palace of Fine Arts. The bay is just a half mile north, with views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Lombard Street (“the crookedest street in the world”) is a mile walk to the east. And the Pacific Heights neighborhood is just to the south with Alta Plaza Park just a half mile away.

As a guest of our hotel, you’ll also be within walking distance of many iconic San Francisco attractions, including Pier 39 and Ghirardelli Square, and a short distance from Alcatraz Island.”

Colorado

Greg’s Take: I almost didn’t include this one. Some of the photos made this look more like a cheap motel than a nice hotel. Plus, I couldn’t find any suites so I didn’t see a way to get extraordinary value from points. But then I read some of the glowing online reviews. People seriously seem to love this place. Several reviews even said things like “don’t go by the online photos — this place is much nicer than you’d expect.”

Website quote: “The Golden Hotel, Ascend Hotel Collection®, is located in historic downtown Golden, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

Simply step out the front door to stroll across Clear Creek, jog or bike along the trails and experience the shops, restaurants and art galleries in vibrant downtown Golden.”

Illinois

Greg’s Take: This looks like a solid choice (no pun intended) if you want to stay near Grant Park. It’s also a short walk (about half a mile) from Chicago’s Union Station, so this would be a decent option when arriving in Chicago by train. Unfortunately, this is one of the Ascend properties where suites are available for cash but not for points.

Award prices: 20K, 30K

Book suites for same point price? No

Website quote: “Our hotel is located near the urban greenery of Grant Park, Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. Dozens of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance provide a taste of Chicago, including the deep-dish pizza at Gino’s East and the cheddar and caramelcorn mix at Garrett Popcorn Shops. Iconic Chicago attractions like Shedd Aquarium, Alder Planetarium, The Field Museum of Natural History and the shore of Lake Michigan at 12th Street Beach are just minutes away. Hop on the CTA Red or Blue Line to explore the city without a car. Catch your favorite team at Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, United Center or Guaranteed Rate Field, or get a bird’s eye view of the city from Skydeck Chicago at The Willis Tower (formally the Sears Tower) and 360 Chicago.”

Greg’s Take: This place looks seriously nice. Next time I visit Evanston, I’ll definitely look to book a room here! Unfortunately, this is one of the Ascend properties where suites are available for cash but not for points.

Award prices: 16K, 20K, 25K

Website quote: “Join us each morning for our free continental breakfast, highlighted by our fresh house-baked croissants and pastries, and sip a cup of coffee or tea from one of our famous “ugly mugs.” At the end of the day, or at the start of your evening, enjoy a glass of wine as you visit with friends in our Grand Parlor. In summertime, our flowered outdoor roof deck offers a lovely skylight view of downtown Evanston. If you’re looking for a quiet retreat, visit our cozy English library and enjoy a book from our collection—or from yours.”

Michigan

Greg’s Take: I had no idea that this place existed, but now I’m eager to spend a summer weekend here to try it out.

Commenter Paul says: if you check out the Shoreline Inn, be sure to make a trip to Pere Marquette Park (just a few miles down the road). This is one of the nicest beaches in West Michigan, and there is a cool bar/bbq place on the beach. They have live music most weekends during the summer.

You won’t find another hotel like this one in Muskegon. From our waterfront boutique hotel, you’ll enjoy the shores of Muskegon Lake and the sandy beaches of Pere Marquette. Want a little more activity? You’ll also be near Michigan’s Adventure and Water Park, the largest amusement and water park in the state. But you can also find plenty to enjoy at our unique hotel. Take a walk along Terrace Point Marina just behind our hotel, and you can watch boats come in and out of the marina — or just watch the sunset.”

Missouri

Greg’s Take: This looks very nice, but it was also very inexpensive on all of the dates that I looked at. As a result, this might be a better place to earn Choice points with a paid stay rather than to spend them.

Award prices: 16K, 20K

Book suites for same point price? Yes (I found both a 2 bedroom suite and a king corner suite available for points)

Website quote: “Guests included Harry S. Truman, Bette Davis and Clint Eastwood. Over time, the hotel was converted to a senior living facility, and in 1998 was bought and restored to its former glory as a hotel. Today, the Hotel Bothwell, Ascend Hotel Collection®, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.”

Montana

Greg’s Take: The cabins themselves don’t look like much, but this property looks amazing. I would love to try this place out in the summer.

Award prices: 25K, 30K

Book suites for same point price? Unknown (lodge is only open seasonally “typically mid-April through mid-October” so I wasn’t able to look at award stays within the next 100 days)

Website quote: “Contemporary accommodations meet the rustic spirit of Yellowstone at our cozy riverside lodge in Livingston, Montana, featuring incredible views of the Absaroka Mountain Range and amazing opportunities for outdoor activities, from rafting to horseback riding. Whether you’re here for solitude and relaxation, a one-of-a-kind fly fishing experience, or just a night of sleep on a longer adventure, your stay at Yellowstone Valley Lodge & Grill is sure to be a memorable one.”

New Jersey

Greg’s Take: My wife and I stayed at the Peacock Inn a couple of years ago, and we loved it. Princeton NJ is a beautiful town, but most of the chain hotels are located on route 1, well away from the town’s beauty. The cool place to stay is near Princeton’s main drag, Nassau Street, but hotel prices in town are exorbitant. Luckily, the Peacock Inn is right in town and available to book with Choice points!

Book suites for same point price? Yes (Even the Penthouse suite can be booked with points when available!)

Website quote: “With less than 20 total guest rooms, this is a true boutique hotel experience. But the amenities are remarkably modern, including flat-screen TVs, banquet rooms, and hotel-wide free WiFi. And if you feel the need to explore one of the country’s largest cities, New York City is less than 60 miles away. You can make the day trip to Manhattan and still be back for one of our delicious dinner options in the evening. With free hot coffee waiting for you in the morning, you’ll be ready for a whole new adventure each day.”

New York

Greg’s Take: This looks like it would be a nice option for those looking to stay in Midtown. Personally, I’d still pick Hyatt’s Andaz 5th Avenue hotel over this one, but if visiting in the summer and if the King suite with balcony is available at the Draper, this one might win me over.

Award prices: 16K, 20K, 30K

Book suites for same point price? Yes (King suite with balcony)

Website quote: “We’re conveniently located in the heart of New York City on 37th Street close to the Chrysler Building and the iconic Grand Central Terminal. Enjoy a day wandering the Theater District with Times Square at its core and Broadway musicals on every corner. Spend an afternoon hanging out with locals in Bryant Park or make your way to Columbus Circle at the corner of Central Park, where you can watch musicians play live or grab a hot dog.”

Greg’s Take: This appears to be a beautiful and swanky downtown hotel, and it gets great reviews. Unfortunately, this is one of the Ascend properties where suites are available for cash but not for points.

Watch the sun set with a cocktail in hand on our rooftop lounge, Vue, featuring panoramic views of downtown Buffalo, Lake Erie, and the Canadian shoreline.”

Greg’s Take: I’d always prefer to stay on the Canadian side of the falls, but if you’re planning to stay on the American side, this looks like a great option.

Website quote: “Stay in the heart of scenic Middletown at The Carriage House Inn, Ascend Hotel Collection®. This fully renovated Victorian-era home has been transformed into a boutique hotel that embodies historic charm and modern amenities near Newport, RI.”

Texas

Greg’s Take: Based on the hotel’s photos, I don’t get the appeal, but this hotel’s reviews are excellent.

Award prices: 16K, 20K

Book suites for same point price? No (None available that I could find)

Website quote: “Guests can enjoy an authentic Cleburne experience with a stay at our Liberty Hotel, Ascend Hotel Collection®. Located in the heart of downtown Cleburne, we offer easy access to many of the popular things to do here. We’re just steps away from the Gone With the Wind Museum, which includes a collection of more than 6,000 pieces of history and memorabilia.”

Greg’s Take: While most Ascend Collection hotels are in-town boutique inns, this one is something completely different: a resort and spa on the far edge of town (about 20 miles from the River Walk). Still, it looks awesome and you can book a suite for the same number of points as a standard room.

Photograph: David Gray/Reuters New Zealand New Zealand raises interest rates for the first time in seven years Rate hike puts New Zealand ahead of most other developed economy nations as central banks look to wind back emergency-level borrowing costs Reuters Wed 6 Oct 2021 05.41 BST Share on Facebook

Share via Email

New Zealand’s central bank has raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, signalling further tightening to come, as it looks to get on top of inflationary pressures and cool a red-hot housing market.

The 25 basis point rate rise on Wednesday marks the start of a tightening cycle that had been expected to begin in August, but was delayed after an outbreak of the coronavirus Delta variant and a lockdown that is continuing in its biggest city Auckland.

The New Zealand dollar briefly rose after the announcement of the increase in the official cash rate to 0.50%, but fell back to $0.6930, in line with broader market moves.

“It was pretty much in line with what everyone was picking,” Jason Wong, senior market strategist at BNZ in Wellington, said. “We’re on a path towards a series of rate hikes and the market is well priced for that.“

Announcing its decision, the RBNZ said further removal of monetary policy stimulus was expected, with future moves depending on the medium-term outlook for inflation and employment.

The rate hike puts New Zealand ahead of most other developed economy nations as central banks look to wind back emergency-level borrowing costs, although countries including Norway, the Czech Republic and South Korea have already raised rates.

In Australia, the central bank held interest rates at a record low 0.1% for an 11th straight month on Tuesday.

Economists expect the benchmark rate to reach 1.50% by the end of next year and 1.75% by the end of 2023, a Reuters poll showed.

New Zealand has enjoyed a rapid economic recovery since a Covid-driven recession last year, partly because it reopened its economy before others following efforts to eliminate coronavirus.

But with its borders still shut, labour and goods shortages are pushing up inflation, as well as contributing to a surging property market, which has been driven by ultra-low interest rates.

“Demand shortfalls are less of an issue than the economy hitting capacity constraints,” the RBNZ committee noted in the minutes of the meeting.

The central bank said headline CPI inflation is expected to increase above 4% in the near-term but return towards its 2% midpoint over the medium term.

Recent Covid-19 restrictions have not materially changed the medium-term outlook for inflation and employment, and economic activity will recover quickly when the measures are eased, it said.

But economists said the RBNZ may not race ahead with its hiking cycle in view of the current global uncertainty and the Delta variant outbreak dragging on in Auckland.

“[We] remain of the view that further rate hikes will be in 25 basis point increments rather than 50 basis point moves,” Citibank economist Josh Williamson said.

New Zealand abandoned its strategy of eliminating Covid-19 this week, with the government saying it will have to live with the virus and step up vaccination rates to control it.

In August, a central bank official confirmed it had also considered a 50-basis-point move that month, before taking a rate hike off the table altogether due to the lockdown.",06/10/2021,Citibank,"Show caption The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has increased interest rates for the first time in seven years.

NewsApi.org,"China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) wired funds to a trustee account on Thursday for a dollar bond interest payment due Sept. 23, a source told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have plunged the embattled developer into formal default.

The source corroborated a story in the state-backed Securities Times on Friday that the company had remitted $83.5 million in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday, allowing it to pay out to all bond holders before the grace period expires on Oct. 23.

""They seem to be avoiding short-term default and it's a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,"" said a Hong Kong-based restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders.

WHAT LIES BENEATH? HIDDEN DEBT FEARS FEED CHINA'S PROPERTY WOES

""But still, Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring.""

Evergrande did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Citi declined to comment.

News of the wired payment comes a day after financial information provider REDD reported on Thursday that the company had secured more time to pay a defaulted bond issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises and guaranteed by Evergrande. read more

A string of Chinese officials in recent days have sought to reassure investors, saying that creditors' interests would be protected. Market participants nevertheless expressed shock at news of the payment. read more

""This is a positive surprise,"" said James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd, adding many had expected a default.

CHINA POWER ISSUE MAY MAKE THE GLOBAL CAR SHORTAGE MUCH WORSE

The news would boost bondholders' confidence, he said, as ""there are many coupon payments due ahead. If Evergrande pays this time, I don't see why it won't pay the next time.""

Evergrande missed two coupon payments on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23 and Sept. 30, starting the clock on 30-day grace periods for payment. Non-payment of interest for 30 days would result in a formal default by the company, and trigger cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar bonds.

Evergrande's dollar bonds surged on Friday morning, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, according to data provider Duration Finance.

Evergrande's shares rose about 4%, a day after the resumption of trade following a more than two-week suspension pending the announcement of a scrapped stake sale in its property management unit.

NewsApi.org,"Air France canceled the flight because of the pandemic. Cook Travel promised me a full refund. That was one year ago. Cook Travel has asked me to be patient, but now they are not responding to my inquiries. I’ve tried to dispute the charges with Citibank, my credit card issuer, but a representative told me too much time has elapsed. I’ve tried to reach out to executives at Air France and Cook Travel but have gotten no response. Can you help me?

Q. Last year, I bought tickets to fly from San Francisco to Stockholm on Air France. I booked the tickets through Cook Travel, a travel agency in New York. I paid for the tickets with my credit card.

JIM SHEA, San Mateo, Calif.

A. If an airline cancels a flight, it has to send you a refund within seven business days. That’s not my rule; it’s the US Department of Transportation’s (www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds). If I had my way, I’d make them refund it as quickly as they took your money, which is within a few seconds. So, for Air France to make you wait one year is outrageous.

Your travel agency should have fought for your refund. After all, aren’t travel agents supposed to represent you? And how about your credit card company? Citibank could have easily accepted your dispute. The Fair Credit Billing Act, the law that protects credit card customers, does not prevent your bank or credit card issuer from getting involved in a dispute, even if it’s been longer than 90 days. Citibank could have done better.

Based on the correspondence between you, Cook Travel, and the airline, here’s what happened to your money. Air France tried to refund the ticket directly to your credit card. For some reason, that failed. Then, an Air France representative told you that your travel agent had the money. The travel agency said it does not have the refund. It appears that they just pointed the finger at each other until they lost interest in resolving your case.

Perhaps you could have reached out to someone higher up at Air France to resolve this. I list names, numbers, and e-mail addresses of the Air France executives on my consumer advocacy website at www.elliott.org/company-contacts/air-france/.

I contacted Cook Travel. A representative looked into your refund and verified that Air France had tried to send the money. You checked with your bank, which contradicted the Air France claim. According to your bank, Air France did not attempt to transfer money to your account. It’s possible that the airline had the wrong account number or routing number. Air France agreed to cancel the original transfer request and create a new one, which it did. You’ve received a full refund.

NewsApi.org,"DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The ""Hong Kong Retail Banking - Competitor Benchmarking 2021"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

This report looks at market performance, retention risk, and current account market share. It ranks Hong Kong's top banks across a range of criteria, from digital adoption and user experience to rewards and money management tools.

Despite the impact of COVID-19, banks in Hong Kong remain well capitalized and ready to support recovery going forward. All incumbents increased their total divisional assets (TDA) in 2020.

Although the threat of a long-term low-rate environment persists, profitability is unlikely to be affected as banks focus on controlling costs and non-interest income. As net interest margins across the banking sector compress due to the need for ultra-low interest rates, the importance of non-price factors has become significantly more important in the banking space.

Scope

Use of digital channels peaked in 2020. However, reversion to pre-pandemic habits appears to be underway. Standard Chartered, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, and Bank of China are all experiencing greater branch usage in 2021 than in 2020.

38% of Citibank customers have joined within the last five years, suggesting its customer acquisition efforts have been successful.

HSBC leads the way in terms of cross-selling, with 20% of its customers holding three products with the bank. Challengers ZA Bank and Mox Bank struggle in this regard due to a lack of services.

NewsApi.org,"NEW DELHI: Perhaps the biggest takeaway for markets from the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy statement last week was that normalisation of the ultra-accommodative policies has started in the country.The central bank, aware of the risks of adding fresh liquidity to the banking system amid upside risks to inflation , paused the government security acquisition program that it had adopted since April and announced a larger quantum of funds to be withdrawn from the system through its variable rate reverse repo operations.However, one of the key market metrics which indicate a bearish view on interest rates has barely registered any change – short-term gilt yields.Papers maturing in up to five year or so are typically the most sensitive to liquidity conditions and the interest rate scenario.And if one goes by the price action in such securities, the market is pretty confident that any normalisation is some time away.Yields on the most liquid 3-year and 5-year securities have actually declined 3 basis point and 7 basis points respectively since RBI ’s monetary policy statement in August. Hardly a sign of a market which is expecting imminent normalization of monetary policy.While yields on Treasury Bills had shot up in the runup to the policy statement, that was more to do with the commentary surrounding a possible central bank response to a sudden surge in crude oil prices.In the days preceding the policy statement, many segments of the market, including major foreign lender Citibank, had predicted a rise in the reverse repo rate , from its current all-time low of 3.35 per cent.RBI’s decision to set the cutoff rate at a recent reverse repo auction at 3.99 per cent -- just below the benchmark policy repo rate of 4.00 per cent -- also stoked speculation that the central bank was looking to realign money market rates to the repo rate rather that the reverse repo rate of 3.35 per cent.The reverse repo rate effectively represents the overnight cost of funds for banks due to the huge surplus of liquidity – currently estimated around Rs 7 lakh crores -- in the banking system.What actually happened on the ground was different. RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee held all key rates steady and while it did start the tricky process of modulating excess liquidity from the banking system, the consensus is that the central bank has pulled off the task quite adroitly.“The main reason why short-term bonds have not reacted to the policy is because the RBI has done a very good job with communication,” PNB Gilts Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Vikas Goel said.“Look at MIBOR (Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate). The fixings are not anywhere close to the repo rate and it will take some time to head even to the 3.70 per cent or 3.80 per cent levels. Basically the market is now of the view that whatever happens will happen gradually. There will not be a crash landing. I expect that in either December or February there could be a 15-basis-point rise in the reverse repo rate but the actual cost of funds is unlikely to shoot up anytime soon,” he said.Yields on longer-tenure bonds may have climbed on Friday but that phenomenon was inevitable, given demand-supply dynamics. Absorbing Rs 12.05 lakh crore, a large portion of which is longer-term papers, is no easy task, especially when RBI steps back from upfront committed bond purchases.Typically, markets take a day or two to digest monetary policy statements, but the proof of the pudding is always in the price action. Going by that metric, the lack of response in short-term bond yields is testament to the market’s confidence that policy accommodation is not going to leave abruptly, despite high oil prices and the US Federal Reserve’s guidance of tighter monetary policy.RBI would undoubtedly be relieved after the reaction in short-term bonds as most corporate borrowing is benchmarked against government securities maturing in 3 to 8 years.Growth indicators may be showing a revival in the economy but it is still far from being capable of absorbing the shock of a sudden rise in borrowing costs.“Now that the policy is done, I think short-term bonds will remain around these levels,” a senior trader at a large foreign bank said on condition of anonymity.“5.63 per cent, 2026 had sold off earlier and then traders had a renewed interest in the bond because there was no extra GST borrowing. The trade is again getting crowded, but I think looking for carry is a sensible option in the current scenario where liquidity is still plentiful and rate hikes are some time away,” he said.",12/10/2021,Citibank,"The fixings are not anywhere close to the repo rate and it will take some time to head even to the 3.70 per cent or 3.80 per cent levels.

NewsApi.org,"Qantas announced the release of ‘millions’ of award seats as Australia re-opens. So far Australians are expected to be able to leave their country next month (and return!) with rules for what they must do on arrival varying by state. There’s no announced timeline for visitors to come to Australia, but there’s reason to be hopeful.

I’ve been waiting to see my family since before the pandemic, and I’ve booked and then had to cancel many awards. Fortunately Qantas awards are usually bookable with American AAdvantage miles, which have no cancel/redeposit fees for any member any longer. They’re also generally bookable with Alaska Airlines miles.

Early reports were that most of the seats being made available were domestic and coach for international, but I was going to persist.

In general when Qantas award seats are added into inventory you won’t see them on the American Airlines website. That was my first stop and I simply didn’t find Qantas business class seats between the U.S. and Australia coming up when I searched (I did find one date in 2022 where American offered three business seats on their own LA-Sydney flight). It’s a better idea to search the Qantas or British Airways websites and then call American to book. Space may not match exactly but it’s usually close.

In this case though I’m finding seats being made available to Qantas members and not to partners. The seats aren’t available on the British Airways website either, and weren’t available when I called American. That could be by design,, or a matter of timing (that they’ll become available to partners shortly).

Of course Qantas is a transfer partner of American Express, Citibank and Capital One. Their long haul business class awards are expensive, both in points and money (since they add fuel surcharges). Brisbane – Los Angeles is 108,400 miles and US$261 one way.

Still, I was determined. My first shot was April 2022, looking for 3 business class seats either Los Angeles – Brisbane or San Francisco – Sydney, because these two routes are historically easier than Los Angeles – Sydney and Dallas – Sydney is likely to return later than LA flying. There was some availability, and remember 3 seats are always harder than 2.

I looked at June and found nothing, but come July (their winter, but it’s not actually cold, and I’d spend part of the time up near Queensland in any case where it’s warmer) space really opened up on these two routes. You’ll see some LA – Sydney and San Francisco – Brisbane space here as well (not to mention connections via Tokyo which aren’t priced as a single award by American AAdvantage):

International awards booked with Qantas miles by February 28, 2022 for travel through end of 2022 are cancellable free of charge. I don’t really want to spend the miles Qantas charges, and don’t really want to risk stranding miles in a Qantas account – but since I travel to Australia often to see family they won’t really be stranded. If the trip doesn’t work out I’ll book another one later.",19/10/2021,Citibank,"Qantas announced the release of ‘millions’ of award seats as Australia re-opens.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lincoln Avenue Capital, a leading, mission-driven investor in and developer of affordable housing, has signed an agreement to acquire the majority stake in a social purpose real estate investment fund, the Housing Partnership Equity Trust (HPET), which invests in affordable housing across the United States. The transition is expected to be complete by the end of this year, after which Lincoln Avenue Capital will serve as one of the largest, single private investors in affordable housing.

Lincoln Avenue Capital logo. (PRNewsfoto/Lincoln Avenue Capital)

HPET was originally founded nine years ago by major Wall Street banks, prominent foundations, and nonprofit housing organizations that came together to pioneer an innovative approach to affordable housing investment and preservation. Until now, HPET has been principally owned by some of the nation's largest and most respected not-for-profit developers and operators of affordable and workforce housing for low- and moderate-income individuals and families. In partnership with HPET nonprofits, Lincoln Avenue Capital plans to purchase at least $150 million annually in workforce and affordable housing to expand HPET's investments.

The company will continue HPET's traditional focus on largely unsubsidized affordable housing (what is also referred to as ""naturally occurring affordable housing"" or ""NOAH""). Their rents are lower than those of the area's housing market.

""Building and preserving affordable housing is one of the most important social causes of our time,"" said Jeremy Bronfman, CEO and founder of Lincoln Avenue Capital. ""HPET has pioneered and proven a powerful model for bringing together private and nonprofit partners to develop and sustain affordable and workforce housing that strengthens communities. Lincoln Avenue Capital is well equipped to build on this success. We are delighted to be partnering with leading nonprofit and philanthropic organizations that share our mission to increase HPET's impact across the country.""

""Affordable housing is tangible and essential for individuals, for families, and for communities. Lincoln Avenue Capital's work aligns deeply with that of HPET's, and we look forward to their stewardship,"" said HPET CEO and president Anne McCulloch. ""This transaction is a new chapter for HPET with a leading impact investing partner that brings expertise in affordable housing. It's a milestone in our industry and a preview of the path forward in making housing more accessible in our nation.""

Established in 2012, HPET was built on an idea first proposed by the Housing Partnership Network (HPN), a collaborative of 100 leading affordable housing and community development nonprofits, and other housing advocates. The group advanced the idea that more private capital would be attracted into affordable housing if a real estate investment trust (REIT) could be formed with some of the nation's largest and most respected nonprofit developers and operators of affordable multifamily housing. To put the concept into action, HPN and its members worked with the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and other major investors including Citibank, Charles Schwab Bank, the Ford Foundation, Prudential, and Morgan Stanley Bank. Today, HPET serves nearly 3,000 households in seven U.S. states.

""Expanding access to safe, affordable homes is key to our country's fight against inequality and racial injustice,"" said Debra Schwartz, MacArthur's Managing Director for Impact Investments. ""We are proud to have supported HPET's groundbreaking work since inception and excited that Lincoln Avenue's partnership with HPET's leading nonprofit housing organizations promises even greater scale and impact in the years ahead.""

Lincoln Avenue Capital is expected to close on the purchase by the end of 2021. It will acquire a majority interest in HPET, which it will own alongside the other institutional investors, including the MacArthur Foundation. HPET's nonprofit partners will retain ownership of 7.5 percent of the company. Other investment partners include Prudential Impact Investments Private Equity LLC, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., and Charles Schwab Bank, SSB. Under Lincoln Avenue Capital's leadership, HPET will continue to aggressively seek out new housing investment opportunities and additional private capital. Beekman Advisors acted as investment banker for HPET in the transaction.

""In nearly every U.S. market, naturally occurring affordable housing is disappearing,"" said Tom Bledsoe, HPN's president and CEO. ""The most effective way to address this challenge is through more impact investment. This acquisition is a clear demonstration of that idea and transforms the entity into becoming one of the industry's premier workforce housing platforms.""

This acquisition is the culmination of a vision, almost a decade in the making, to truly scale up and expand social impact investment in affordable housing,"" said Linda Mandolini, HPET board member and CEO of California's Eden Housing, one of HPET's 14 not-for-profit developers. ""Now nonprofits will have an even greater set of tools to expand investment in the development and preservation of critically needed housing.""

""At Lincoln Avenue Capital, we're focused on advancing solutions in affordable housing and creating impact for generations to come,"" said Jeremy Bronfman. ""More than ever, the need for quality, sustainable, affordable homes is clear. This new chapter for HPET represents what is possible when mission-driven businesses, nonprofit organizations, and foundations come together to tackle the pressing need for affordable and workforce housing.""

NewsApi.org,"Air France owes Jim Shea a refund for a flight it canceled during the pandemic. But he’s been waiting a year for his money. So where is it?

Question

Last year, I bought tickets to fly from San Francisco to Stockholm on Air France. I booked the tickets through Cook Travel, a travel agency in New York. I paid for the tickets with my credit card.

Elliott Advocacy is underwritten by battleface -- At -- At battleface , we deliver insurance that doesn’t quit when circumstances change. We provide specialty travel insurance services and benefits to travelers visiting or working internationally, including in the world’s most hard to reach places. Currently selling in 54 countries and growing, our mission is to deliver simple solutions to travelers worldwide heading out on their next adventure.

Air France canceled the flight because of the pandemic and Cook Travel promised me a full refund. That was one year ago. Cook Travel has asked me to be patient, but now they are not responding to my inquiries. I’ve tried to dispute the charges with Citibank, my credit card issuer. Unfortunately, a representative told me too much time has elapsed. I’ve tried to reach out to executives at Air France and Cook Travel but have gotten no response — and no refund. Can you help me? — Jim Shea, San Mateo, Calif.

Answer

If an airline cancels a flight, it has to send you a refund within seven business days. That’s not my rule; it’s the U.S. Department of Transportation’s. If I had my way, I’d make them refund it as quickly as they took your money, which is within a few seconds. So, for Air France to make you wait one year for your refund is outrageous.

Your travel agency should have fought for your money. After all, aren’t travel agents supposed to represent you? And how about your credit card? Citibank could have easily accepted your dispute. The Fair Credit Billing Act, the law that protects credit card customers, does not prevent your bank or credit card issuer from getting involved in a dispute, even if it’s been longer than 90 days. Citibank could have done better. (You can read more about credit card chargebacks here.)

Based on the correspondence between you, Cook Travel and Air France, here’s what happened to your refund.

Air France tried to refund the ticket directly to your credit card. For some reason, that failed. Then an airline representative told you that your travel agent had the money. The travel agency said it did not have the refund. It appears that they just pointed the finger at each other until they lost interest in resolving your case.

You could have reached out to someone higher up at Air France to track down your refund. We list the names, numbers and email addresses of the Air France executives in our database.

I contacted Cook Travel. A representative looked into your refund and verified that Air France had tried to send the money. You checked with your bank, which contradicted the Air France claim. According to your bank, Air France did not attempt to transfer money to your account. It’s possible that the airline had the wrong account number or routing number. Air France agreed to cancel the original transfer request and create a new one, which it did.

NewsApi.org,"By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday, buying it another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

The property developer also announced plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Facing a deadline on Saturday to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, Evergande sent $83.5 million to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, the person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

That brought relief for investors and regulators worried about fallout for global markets and added to reassurances from Chinese officials that creditors would be protected.

Still, the world's most indebted property firm - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - needs to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default on Oct. 29.

With little known about its ability to pay and property sales tumbling 30% in the last 12 months, there is deep scepticism over Evergrande's capacity to ride out the crisis.

The company, once China's top-selling property developer, did not respond to a request for comment on debt payment.

Citibank declined to comment.

Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said on Friday the company would aim to make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business instead of property within 10 years.

Property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year by that time, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, he was quoted as saying by the state-backed Securities Times.

Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.

Story continues

'BIT OF A RELIEF'

Evergrande's overall woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value.

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

It was not clear how cash-strapped Evergrande was able to raise funds to pay the bondholders or whether any had already received the money. Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Oct. 29 and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.

""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.

""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next.""

If it fails to make next week's payment, or any other final deadlines in coming weeks, defaults would be triggered on all $19 billion of its bonds in international capital markets.

That would be the second biggest emerging market corporate default after Venezuela's state-owned oil firm.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.

DISTRESSED LEVELS

Evergrande's dollar bond prices surged on Friday morning after news of the transfer, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of less than a quarter of face value.

Those gains evaporated on Friday afternoon in Asia, however, pushing several of the company's other bonds down more than 6%.

Evergrande's shares rose as much as 7.8% before closing up 4.3%, but still finished a shortened week down 8.8%.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.

Chinese property companies could now be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year.

Still, Friday's news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index rise 3.3%.

In mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index finished up 2.4%, and an index tracking the broader property sector added 2%.

Asked whether it would step in to help its rival ease its liquidity crisis, the chairman of China's third-biggest developer, China Vanke Co Ltd, said developers needed to ensure their own safety first.

""Everyone feels the chill as 'winter' arrives for the sector,"" Chairman Yu Liang told a company forum.

Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.

A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,"" said Quiddity's Lundy.

NewsApi.org,"Tech support scams work because they try to trick people into believing there's a serious security crisis with their computers, says Norton Labs.

You receive a phone call, an email or a popup on the web claiming that your computer is at risk and that some security firm or product is needed to fix the problem. Though such scams seem obvious to people knowledgeable about cyber threats, many people still fall for this type of ploy. In fact, the tech support ruse was the number one scam described by Norton Labs in its new October Consumer Cyber Safety Pulse Report.

SEE: Fighting social media phishing attacks: 10 tips (free PDF) (TechRepublic)

Tech support hoaxes topped Norton's list of phishing threats for 13 consecutive weeks from July 1 through Sept. 30. These scams are designed to trick you into believing that your computer is facing some dire security risk.

In reality, the criminals behind these con games want to steal your personal information, gain access to your bank account or install malware on your PC. Many scammers will employ standard phishing tactics by impersonating the names of major technology companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple.

These ploys proliferate for a few reasons, according to Norton. They take advantage of the increased need by people to use their devices to juggle hybrid work and home life. They capitalize on FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) by trying to frighten people into believing that there's something wrong with their computers. Further, they continue because they work. Norton also expects these scams to take off further as we head into the holiday season.

The best defense against these tech support scams is awareness, according to Norton. Never call a phone number based on a pop-up notification or warning. Instead, contact the company directly through its website. The same advice holds true for any emails you receive claiming a security problem with your PC. And if you get such a phone call, simply hang up.

But tech support scams aren't the only threats covered in Norton's latest Pulse report.

Gamers are another audience that cybercriminals like to target. In one particular phishing campaign, attackers went after people who play RuneScape, a popular and free multiplayer online role-playing game. The initial goal was to steal the login credentials of players. After RuneScape developer Jagex added such security measures as two-factor authentication, the scammers countered by concocting phishing emails designed to steal the 2FA codes.

To avoid falling for phishing scams, don't click on links from unexpected emails or text messages. Instead, browse to the website of the service listed in the message to contact the company directly if necessary.

In another incident, a phishing campaign targeted Citibank customers by spoofing the bank's actual home page in an attempt to steal account credentials. In this case, remember that your bank will never send you emails or texts asking you to sign in with your account.

In a gift card scam, attackers used a certain website to try to guess gift card numbers and PINs until they found the right combinations. They then resold those cards online. With this scam, Norton advises people to always check the value of a gift card after you obtain it.

NewsApi.org,"Chinese property developer Evergrande evaded default this week with a last-minute bond coupon payment, which bought the company another week to deal with its $300 billion debt crisis.

According to Chinese state media, Evergrande sent a $83.5 million bond payment to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, a day before the deadline to pay interest on its US dollar bond.

The heavily indebted company will have to make payments on a range of other bonds, currently amounting to around $300 billion. The next deadline for the bond payment is October 29, when the company will have to pay another $47.5 million. After that, it has nearly $338 million in offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.

Evergrande’s dollar bond prices jumped on Friday morning after news of the bond payment transfer, data from Duration Finance showed, but then fell in afternoon trading in Asia, pushing several of the company’s other bonds down more than 6%. Evergrande’s shares traded up 4.3% at market closing time, but still showed an 8.8% drop on a weekly basis.

The company has been trying to raise funds over the past weeks, but the attempts have been futile. A $2.6 billion deal fell through earlier this week, when talks to sell a 50.1% stake in Evergrande Property Services arm to Hopson Development Holdings ended in deadlock. Evergrande confirmed the termination of the deal on Wednesday. Earlier, Reuters reported that the $1.7 billion sale of the group’s Hong Kong headquarters failed last week due to an unnamed buyer’s worries over Evergrande’s financial situation.

Meanwhile, in a post on its WeChat account, the company said on Sunday that it has resumed work on more than 10 projects in Shenzhen, Dongguan, and other Chinese cities, adding that some of these projects have entered the interior decoration stage while others have recently finished construction. Still, the prospect of Evergrande’s default puts in jeopardy more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in 280 cities.

If it evades default, Evergrande plans to shift its focus from property development to its electric vehicles business. According to chairman Hui Ka Yan, the company aims to make its new electric vehicle venture, launched in 2019, its primary business instead of property within 10 years. The venture, however, has not yet revealed a production model, nor sold a single vehicle.

NewsApi.org,"There are many reasons for even the smallest businesses to have business bank accounts. For one, separating your business and personal finances can protect your personal assets. Plus, come tax time, tracking down expenses and deductions is easier with a business bank account.

But depending on the bank, you can also access important services for your company, such as business credit cards and loans. In today’s world, it can be hard to find the best bank for small businesses — from going with a big bank, opting to work with a local credit union, or even signing up for online-only institutions.

No matter what your business needs are, here are the best banks for small businesses.

Do I Need a Business Bank Account?

Whether you have a side hustle or plan to build a full corporation, a business bank account is a smart move, and sometimes, it’s legally required.

If you’re a sole proprietor, you don’t have to open a business bank account, but it can help protect your personal finances and make tax season easier by tracking spending all in one place, separate from your personal account. This is especially helpful in the event of an audit.

Even if you have an LLC, which can offer some liability legal protections, your personal assets may become vulnerable if you are sued while using one personal account for both personal and business purposes.

What Do I Need To Open a Business Bank Account?

Opening a business bank account requires more hoops to jump through than opening a personal account, but it’s worth the additional protection and services.

Here’s everything you may need to open a business bank checking and/or savings account. Keep in mind that requirements may vary by bank, so check with the bank in advance to gather the appropriate documents and paperwork.

Government-issued ID

EIN (employer identification number); a social security number will also work only if you are a sole proprietor, but filing for an EIN is free and takes just a few minutes.

Certificate of DBA if you are operating under a trade/fictitious name

Business license, if applicable

Articles of Organization or Articles of Incorporation for LLCs and corporations, respectively

Partnership agreements for partnerships

Which Is the Best Bank For Small Businesses?

Ultimately, the best bank for small businesses depends on your specific needs. Whether you just need a checking account to hold the business’ finances and track spending or you need several accounts and credit cards, you’ll want to request more information from different banks to find the best one for you. Here are some of the top banks for small businesses across the board.

1. Credit Unions

Small businesses may benefit from checking out their local credit unions for opening a business account. Credit unions typically have lower and fewer fees for business bank accounts compared to large banks, because credit unions are not-for-profit. Credit unions may also offer lower loan interest rates and better dividends for members.

Chase is a popular business bank option, especially if you’ll need business credit cards thanks to the Chase Ink credit cards as well as co-branded credit card options, all of which offer cash back programs and rewards points for business spending.

Chase offers multiple business checking account options, which vary based on the amount of money you expect to keep in the account and receive each month. The best option for small businesses is the Chase Business Complete Banking checking account. There are also two business savings account options.

Many business bank accounts have fees or limits depending on the number of transactions. So if your online business has large numbers of sales each month, even if each sale is small, you may be limited by your bank account or you could incur fees for extra transactions. Capital One may be perfect for you, as it offers unlimited transactions and cash deposits. You’ll also get a free business debit card when you set up an account.

If you travel a lot or may require business loans, Wells Fargo could be a good option for your business. Wells Fargo has great branch accessibility with over 5,000 branch locations and 13,000 ATMs across 37 states and Washington, D.C.

Wells Fargo is a top pick for business loans, too — it offers SBA loans, business lines of credit, commercial real estate financing, and more. You can also get small business insurance through Wells Fargo.

Ideal for new businesses or businesses with few transactions, US Bank offers fee-free accounts. That means it’s easier to get your business up and running. You’ll get the perks of a big bank, like a reliable mobile app and branch accessibility, with fewer fees and daily balance requirements. Just keep in mind that there are fees for overdrafts and limits on transactions, so it might not be a good fit if you expect a high number of transactions.

Best Online Banks for Small Business

Sometimes, you need more capital to help your business continue to grow. If you need small business loans, consider one of these top banks.

Wells Fargo is well-known for its small business loan options, including three lines of credit, commercial real estate financing, SBA loans, and other financing products. Credit lines range from $5,000 to $500,000. Note that the highest business line of credit options will require your business to earn at least $2 million in annual sales.

Bank of America is one of the top banks for business loans with the highest amount of commercial and industrial loans compared to any other bank as of 2020. The bank offers term loans with borrowing limits up to $250,000, business lines of credit without set maximums for borrowing and SBA loans — it also offers commercial auto and commercial real estate loans.

Citibank is another great option for small business loans, especially if you feel overwhelmed by the types of loans available. The bank offers a smaller range of loans that can suit your needs. Citibank offers term loans of $5,000 to $3 million with up to 7-year terms and fixed interest rates. Citibank also offers two business lines of credit for $10,000 to $3 million.

NewsApi.org,"Yasir al-Rumayyan, the new non-executive chairman of Newcastle United, was involved in a controversial “anti-corruption” campaign in Saudi Arabia that included the transfer of assets on behalf of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

Details of Rumayyan’s role – including the transfer of a charter jet company to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), where he serves as governor – are contained in court documents that shed light on his relationship with Prince Mohammed.

The inner workings of the PIF have been a source of intense interest after it led a consortium that acquired Newcastle United this month. The state-owned sovereign wealth fund is run by Rumayyan and chaired by the crown prince.

The Saudi-led consortium withdrew its bid to acquire Newcastle in 2020 amid concerns that the PIF was part the Saudi state. But the Premier League approved the deal this month and said it had been given “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control” the club. The Premier League has not disclosed the nature of the assurances.

Internal Saudi documents filed to a civil court in Canada as part of an unrelated case show that in 2017 a close aide to Prince Mohammed ordered Rumayyan – who is formally referred to in memos as “his excellency” and the “supervisor” of the PIF – to transfer 20 companies to the sovereign wealth fund as part of the anti-corruption campaign.

One of 20 seized companies, the documents show, was a charter jet company that was later alleged to have been used in the Saudi plot to kill Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies concluded in an intelligence report that was declassified in February that Prince Mohammed approved Khashoggi’s gruesome murder.

There is no suggestion that Rumayyan had any involvement in or knowledge of the alleged use of the jets in the operation that killed the Washington Post journalist.

The documents suggest, however, that a senior aide to the crown prince was able to order Rumayyan to take actions related to the PIF on Prince Mohammed’s behalf. The PIF declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment.

Rumayyan is a former banker who serves as governor of the PIF and chairman of the oil firm Saudi Aramco. He has overseen billions of dollars in investment by the PIF, including in Uber, Facebook, Disney and Citibank.

The Harvard Business School-educated executive is reportedly due to attend his first Newcastle match on Sunday in his new role as non-executive chairman of the club.

The internal Saudi documents were filed in a Canadian court as part of a civil case that has been brought by Saudi-owned entities against a former senior Saudi intelligence official, Saad Aljabri, a critic of Prince Mohammed who in turn has accused the Saudi government of trying to assassinate him in Canada. The Saudi government has denied the claims.

The court records include copies of memos that were sent to his “excellency the supervisor of the Public Investment Fund” by Mohammad al-Sheikh, a senior Saudi adviser to Prince Mohammed.

They relate to the infamous anti-corruption campaign led by the crown prince from November 2017, when 400 of Saudi Arabia’s richest individuals – including princes and ministers – were rounded up and held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh in what was later condemned by witnesses and critics as a purge involving torture, coercion and the expropriation of billions in assets into Saudi coffers.

Mohammad al-Sheikh, the close adviser to the crown prince, defended the campaign in a 2018 interview on CBS. “The anti-corruption crackdown was very simple. We had a serious problem with corruption,” he said. “We had to do what we did at the Ritz.”

The memos are labelled “top secret, not for circulation and very urgent”. The first memo, sent on 22 December 2017, calls on Rumayyan to “transfer” a number of companies to the PIF’s ownership that were seized as part of the anti-corruption purge.

The second memo, dated two days later, repeats the order with greater urgency and tells Rumayyan to “immediately approve the completion of the necessary procedures”.

Saudi documents filed to the court show that in response, Rumayyan sent a handwritten and signed memo on 26 December 2017 to an associate ordering him to “do what’s necessary as fast as possible” to comply with the order. Among the 20 companies included on a list to be transferred to the PIF was Sky Prime Aviation Services, a charter jet company based in Riyadh.

The name of the charter jet company resurfaced in 2019 in a report by Agnes Callamard, the former UN special rapporteur who investigated the Khashoggi killing. She concluded that the team of Saudi agents who killed the journalist used two jets operated by Sky Prime Aviation to travel to and from Istanbul before the murder in the Saudi consulate on October 2018.

CNN first reported in February 2021 that court documents showed that the two private jets used by the Saudi assassination squad were owned by a company that had previously been seized by Prince Mohammed. But other details from the court documents relating to Rumayyan’s role in PIF’s acquisition of the charter jet firm and other companies have not previously been reported.

The PIF declined to respond to a request for comment from Rumayyan and did not respond to a question about the control of Sky Prime Aviation Services. The Saudi embassy in Washington and the Premier League also declined to comment.

Obsessive, illuminating, high-stakes: why investigative journalism matters - video

Rumayyan has in the past described the abrupt manner in which he was selected by the crown prince to lead the PIF as governor in 2015. “I received a call … The crown prince heard of me. I got the call. I thought it was an interview [to lead the PIF], but it was, like: ‘Here is what I want you to do. One, two, three,’” Rumayyan said in a 2020 interview with the Carlyle Group chief executive, David Rubenstein.

After Rumayyan initially said he could start the job in three months, the crown prince told him he had “one month, and you will do it”. A week later Prince Mohammed called back and told Rumayyan he was starting “immediately”.

“We are all very proud to be Saudis and to participate in the positive changes the country is living and doing right now,” Rumayyan said in the Rubenstein interview.

NewsApi.org,"China Evergrande Group paid the US$83.5 million interest payment on its offshore bond, just before a 30-day grace period runs out for declaring it in default, as the world's most indebted developer took action to assure a capital market on edge about the spectre of the nation's highly leveraged property sector.

The Shenzhen-based developer wired the payment due on its 8.25 per cent, US$2.03 billion bond maturing in March 2022 to Citibank on Thursday, according to separate reports by the state-run China Securities Times newspaper and Reuters, both citing unidentified sources. Evergrande did not respond to a request for confirmation while Citibank, the bond's trustee, declined to comment.

Evergrande missed paying the coupon on September 23, and was given a 30-day grace period to comply before it was being declared in default, which could trigger cross defaults on much of its offshore debt and in the worst case set the stage for bondholders to petition for its liquidation. The developer negotiated an ""off-exchange resolution on a separate 4 billion yuan (US$618 million) senior note before a separate deadline last month.

Evergrande, with more than US$300 billion in liabilities, is hardly out of the woods, as it missed five interest payments on its offshore debt in September and October, including Thursday's coupon payment. It has two coupon payments totalling US$235 million due on Sunday.

Its track record was better with onshore debt, as Evergrande made what it called its ""best effort"" to comply, paying the interest this week due on a 2.1 billion yuan senior note that matures in October 2025.

Evergrande, with numerous entities and publicly traded subsidiaries involved in everything from its core real estate development to electric cars, health, bottled water and even a football club, had doubled down on its negotiations to stave off a financial collapse.

Story continues

Its venture Jumbo Fortune Enterprise got creditors to agree this week to an extension on the repayment of a US$260 million bond that Evergrande had guaranteed, according to REDD Intelligence, a bond information portal.

Investors cheered the coupon payment, pushing Evergrande's shares up by as much as 7.8 per cent to an intraday high of HK$2.78 in Hong Kong, reversing yesterday's 12.5 per cent slump when the developer's plan to sell a unit for US$2.6 billion failed to materialise. Evergrande Property Services Group, the management unit that Evergrande withdrew from sale, rose by as much as 5.3 per cent, in contrast to the 10.2 per cent tumble when the withdrawal was announced.

Evergrande's deteriorating finances had spilled over to other leveraged developers in China's property industry, raising concerns among investors about the state of a sector that makes up an estimated 14 per cent of China's economy.

Several Chinese developers, including Hong Kong-listed Sinic Holdings Group and Fantasia Holdings Group, have defaulted on their debt this month, sparking a series of downgrades in the sector by major credit rating agencies.

On Wednesday, Modern Land (China) cancelled its plan to repay a portion of a high-yield US$250 million bond and extend it just days before it was set to mature.

Founded by Chinese tycoon Hui Ka-yan in 1996 in Guangzhou, Evergrande has been racing to sell off assets, from properties under development to a stake in a Northeast China-based bank, to ease its liquidity crunch and repay suppliers - many who say they have not been able to get paid for months.

However, it ran into issues recently as it tried to amass enough capital to keep the lights on and complete its backlog of 1.3 trillion yuan in unfinished properties.

The company has failed to attract a buyer for a 2.2 million sq ft plot in Yuen Long that it hoped to sell at a loss and state-backed Yuexiu Property dropped its proposed US$1.7 billion offer for Evergrande's 26-storey office tower in Wan Chai this month.

On Wednesday, Evergrande said it scrapped the sale of a controlling stake in its Hong Kong-listed property management business to China-based developer Hopson Development in a cantankerous back-and-forth between the two companies. However, Hopson left the doors open on Thursday, saying it still consider the purchase agreement legally binding.

Chinese authorities, including People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, have said that they can contain the economic and financial risks associated with the Evergrande crisis, but have not stepped forward with a public lifeline for the company because of its ""poor management"" and that it ""expanded blindly.""

The Evergrande crisis has left Chinese officials in a difficult spot as they try to balance policy efforts to control speculative pricing bubbles in the mainland property sector with the need to maintain social stability, particularly given the importance housing plays in its economy.

""We believe the mounting pressure will lead the authorities to take further measures to accelerate credit growth before the year-end, including reserve requirement ratio cuts,"" Fitch Ratings analysts Andrew Fennell and Grace Wu said in a research note on Thursday. ""They may also scale back the implementation of some property-related regulations.""

""The three red lines and other measures to control developer leverage may also be tempered, even while they retain rhetorical value as part of government campaigns to improve housing affordability and rein in financial risks,"" they added.

“This will moot Democrats’ excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified Democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation. Alternatively, if Democrats abandon their efforts to ram through another historically reckless taxing and spending spree that will hurt families and help China, a more traditional bipartisan governing conversation could be possible,” he continued in the statement.

Senator Patty Murray said that Democrats plan to delay today’s procedural vote on the debt limit — originally slated at 3pm ET — to discuss internally the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell proposal, CNN reports.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Chuck Schumer tweeted, “Democrats are working to bring this GOP-manufactured default crisis to a swift end and avoid irreparable economic harm to people and families. Today, the Senate will vote on moving forward on House-passed legislation to suspend the debt ceiling.”

Meanwhile, President Biden met with CEOs and leaders today to discuss the need to raise the debt ceiling, including leaders of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Bank of America, Citibank, Deloitte, Intel, JP Morgan, Nasdaq, the National Association of Realtors, and Raytheon, according to a statement on the White House’s website.

“The failure to raise the debt limit will undermine the safety of the United States Treasury securities; threaten the reserve status of the dollar as the world currency and the — that the world relies on; downgrade America’s credit rating; and result in a rise in interest rates for families — talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards,” Biden said today, according to the transcript of this speech.

“My friends — and they are — many are my friends — the Senate Republicans’ position I find to be not only hypocritical, but dangerous and a bit disgraceful, especially as we’re crawling our way out of a pandemic that cost America 700,000 lives thus far, and we’re still battling it. Our markets are rattled. America’s savings are on the line. The American people — your savings, your pocketbook — are directly impacted by this stunt. It doesn’t have to be this way,” he added.

By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday, buying it another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

The property developer also announced plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Facing a deadline on Saturday to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, Evergande sent $83.5 million to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, the person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

That brought relief for investors and regulators worried about fallout for global markets and added to reassurances from Chinese officials that creditors would be protected.

Still, the world's most indebted property firm - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - needs to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default on Oct. 29.

With little known about its ability to pay and property sales tumbling 30% in the last 12 months, there is deep scepticism over Evergrande's capacity to ride out the crisis.

The company, once China's top-selling property developer, did not respond to a request for comment on debt payment.

Citibank declined to comment.

Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said on Friday the company would aim to make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business instead of property within 10 years.

Property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year by that time, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, he was quoted as saying by the state-backed Securities Times.

Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.

'BIT OF A RELIEF'

Evergrande's overall woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value.

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

It was not clear how cash-strapped Evergrande was able to raise funds to pay the bondholders or whether any had already received the money. Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Oct. 29 and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.

""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.

""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next.""

If it fails to make next week's payment, or any other final deadlines in coming weeks, defaults would be triggered on all $19 billion of its bonds in international capital markets.

That would be the second biggest emerging market corporate default after Venezuela's state-owned oil firm.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.

DISTRESSED LEVELS

Evergrande's dollar bond prices surged on Friday morning after news of the transfer, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of less than a quarter of face value.

Those gains evaporated on Friday afternoon in Asia, however, pushing several of the company's other bonds down more than 6%.

Evergrande's shares rose as much as 7.8% before closing up 4.3%, but still finished a shortened week down 8.8%.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.

Chinese property companies could now be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year.

Still, Friday's news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index rise 3.3%.

In mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index finished up 2.4%, and an index tracking the broader property sector added 2%.

Asked whether it would step in to help its rival ease its liquidity crisis, the chairman of China's third-biggest developer, China Vanke Co Ltd, said developers needed to ensure their own safety first.

""Everyone feels the chill as 'winter' arrives for the sector,"" Chairman Yu Liang told a company forum.

Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.

A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,"" said Quiddity's Lundy.

NewsApi.org,"Far from the mountains of Switzerland or the beaches of the Caribbean, South Dakota has become a poster child for the American states that have loosened their tax laws to attract wealthy investors.

""Over the past decade, South Dakota, Nevada and more than a dozen other US states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy,"" according to the vast investigation into offshore tax havens released this week known as the ""Pandora Papers"".

With secrecy and systems that allow clients to evade tax or pay nothing during an inheritance, these states are locked in fierce competition to attract funds from investors at home and abroad.

""Almost half the states are in the competition,"" said Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies, one of the experts who provided background to journalists who worked on the Pandora Papers, told AFP.

He cited, among others, ""Alaska, Wyoming, and Nevada.""

""They tend to be small states,"" he said, where a service industry geared toward finance ""will have a lot of power.""

- Sioux Falls -

If a client needs to create an anonymous shell company that brings together their international activities so as not to pay tax, then Delaware, where President Joe Biden served as senator for 36 years, ""is kind of the premier tax haven state""

""And if you want to create a trust, there are states like South Dakota that have changed their laws to allow a trust to live sometimes forever, [or] at least a century,"" said Collins.

By offering these financial companies a lifespan of 100 years, or longer, the assets included in them can be passed on from generation to generation, without having to pay part of them in estate taxes during an inheritance.

South Dakota, a rural northern-central state famous for the faces of US presidents carved in the rock of Mount Rushmore, is a pioneer in the field, having used financial windfalls to attract investors in the 1970s and 1980s when its economy was at its worst.

Story continues

In 1981 the state began authorizing loans at any interest rate in order to attract the bank card business of Citibank, and the jobs that went with it.

Then, ""year after year in South Dakota, state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders,"" the Pandora Papers said.

Tax law firms based in Sioux Falls now sing the praises on their websites of these laws, their discretion, the low taxes, and the system governing trusts.

""Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion,"" said the Pandora Papers.

- Financially opaque -

Dozens of other states have followed suit, to varying degrees, to the extent, to the point where ""by 2020, 17 of the world's 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states, according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow,"" the investigation said.

The US states also benefited when the Bahamas passed a law at the end of 2018 which required the real identity of the owners of certain companies and trusts to be declared.

That is why the United States came in 25th in the 2020 ranking of tax havens compiled by the Tax Justice Network, an NGO watchdog.

In terms purely of financial opacity, the world's leading economic power comes in a global second, just behind the Cayman Islands.

The United States hosts nearly a quarter (21.37 percent) of the global market for financial services intended for non-residents, the NGO said.

The Biden administration is leading the charge among major powers for tax harmonization between countries.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that US president ""is committed to bringing additional transparency to ... the US and international financial systems.""

Capital One made its reputation as an alternative to airline miles, with David Spade mocking airline co-brands.

Over the past three-plus years they’ve taken their strength consistently delivering on a value proposition – albeit one best-geared to buying cheap tickets – and worked to build a really strong value proposition in frequent and aspirational travel. That’s the new travel portal that’ll help ensure you get the best deal, the soon-to-launch airport lounge network, and that’s transfer of Capital One miles into airline miles.

They’ve consistently been adding features, rarely taking them away – which I love for customers. And they’ve been working to become an essential companion to travel.

If there’s one thing that’s held them back from widespread adoption, it’s the complicated (but good) value proposition of airline miles transfers. And this is a company that built its brand on simple, straightforward value props.

When they launched mileage transfers at the end of 2018 they offered a variety of transfer ratios.

Capital One Venture is a great card, built on earning 2 miles per dollar. Earning ‘always double miles’ makes it hard to then transfer 1:1 into airline miles. Because a card that earns 2 airline miles per dollar, in your choice of airline, on all of your spend (rather than limited categories)? That’s expensive.

But if you earn 2 miles per dollar, and transfer those at 2:1.5, that’s still 1.5 airline miles per dollar spent on everything – which is great.

But you have to do math, stop and think. Capital One keeps doubling down on adding value to travel, and they did so in April introducing… 1:1 transfers to some airlines so you really could earn 2 airline miles per dollar on all of your spend.

It was a limited set of airlines initially. That’s changing. They’ve added several airlines to the 1:1 transfer tier, making the earn power of Capital One Venture as well as Spark Miles even better.

Capital One miles now transfer 1:1 to:

Even with 1:1 transfers, Capital One is offering a 50% bonus on transfers to Etihad in October.

Capital One miles also transfer at 2-to-1.5 into EVA Air Infinity MileageLands. And they transfer 2-to-1 into ALL Accor Live Limitless.

At this point – and EVA Air is a really underappreciated transfer partner – I’d probably just drop EVA Air and Accor to make the value proposition of 1:1 transfers to all partners simple.

I like by the way that they allow transfers in just 100 mile increments rather than 1000 mile increments (as long as there’s a 1000 mile minimum transfer), since I often find after a transfer I might have 878 miles in an account. I’d much rather go closer to zero, and not ‘waste’ that extra 1000 miles. It’s a small win, but something Capital One does for customers that other issuers do not.

And while not all points transfers are instant, the ones you’ll probably use most like Air Canada, Air France, Avianca, British Airways, and Emirates generally seem to be.",07/10/2021,Citibank,"Capital One made its reputation as an alternative to airline miles, with David Spade mocking airline co-brands.

In another fast-moving twist in the debt ceiling saga, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced today that the Democrats have agreed to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s proposal to extend a debt limit extension until December. Yesterday, in a last-minute move just moments before the Senate was set to vote on the debt ceiling, McConnell said Republicans would offer a debt limit extension until December.

“To protect the American people from a near-term Democrat-created crisis, we will also allow Democrats to use normal procedures to pass an emergency debt limit extension at a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into December,” McConnell said (in part) in a statement posted on Twitter.

Today, Schumer clarified that an agreement on an extension of the debt ceiling had been reached, CNN reported. “We have reached agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early December and it’s our hope we can get this done as soon as today,” he said in floor remarks Thursday.

The agreement allows the national debt limit to increase by $480 billion, according to people familiar with the deal, a sum the Treasury Department estimates will allow it to pay bills until Dec. 3, CNBC reports.

This last move comes just 11 days before the U.S. hit its debt ceiling. “We now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by October 18,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month.

Meanwhile, President Biden met with CEOs and leaders yesterday to discuss the need to raise the debt ceiling, including leaders of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Bank of America, Citibank, Deloitte, Intel, JP Morgan, Nasdaq, the National Association of Realtors, and Raytheon, according to a statement on the White House’s website.

“The failure to raise the debt limit will undermine the safety of the United States Treasury securities; threaten the reserve status of the dollar as the world currency and the — that the world relies on; downgrade America’s credit rating; and result in a rise in interest rates for families — talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards,” Biden said today, according to the transcript of this speech.

NewsApi.org,"Event-based analytics platform reveals market patterns, making pro playbook more accessible

Engineers, linguists, data scientists, and stock traders team up to level the playing field between institutional and retail investors with new technology

TYSONS CORNER, VA / ACCESSWIRE / October 4, 2021 / Today, LevelFields announced its public launch to enable equity investors to see and forecast the impact of developing events on stock prices. The technology is built to continuously screen company reports, SEC filings, social media, and news content related to over 6,000 stocks, and identify patterns of events that significantly affect prices over subsequent days and months. The result is an Artificial Intelligence platform that helps investors predict a stock's next move.

The company was cofounded by CEO Andrew Einhorn, a seasoned entrepreneur and data maven who founded and sold a National Science Foundation-backed media analytics company. Einhorn works with a team of software engineers, linguists, data scientists, journalists, professional traders, and even physicists who built pioneering AI and language processing technology for government agencies, corporations, and heads of state.

LevelFields.ai debuts on the heels of one of the most volatile and headline-driven trading periods in history, which has seen the average holding time of stocks shrink from years to just a few months. To help investors navigate this turbulence, the software not only identifies new trading opportunities, but also helps investors avoid costly decisions, like selling too late or purchasing a stock at its peak price.

""Every day in the market, dozens of events are moving stock prices by 10, 50, even 200 percent"" said Einhorn. ""The hard part for retail investors has historically been identifying those stocks before they move - a problem our AI solves with unprecedented scale, speed, and accuracy.""

The platform offers investors an easy-to-use interface that converts everyday news into investable patterns. Users can quickly view the patterns formed by short- and long-term event types such as product launches, leadership changes, and clinical trials. Alerts notify users when the next investing opportunity arises.

Story continues

""When major news is announced, many investors overreact, underreact, or never even hear about it,"" says Einhorn. ""Our system finds these events and demonstrates what's most likely to happen to a stock's share price based on data, not opinion.""

Einhorn added, ""Banks, hedge funds, and wealth managers spend billions on software, data, reports, and analysts to screen and monitor stocks. LevelFields leverages its AI to give retail investors the data processing firepower to more fairly compete with the professionals.""

LevelFields' funding has been largely sourced from its founders' previous exit and successful trades leveraging the LevelFields platform, with additional support from Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology and angel investors.

About LevelFields

LevelFields is the most advanced decision-analytics platform for self-directed investors. Its proprietary Al technology scours millions of events related to thousands of publicly traded companies, demonstrating their impact on stock prices, using historical data to expose patterns and enable retail investors to make faster and more informed decisions.

NewsApi.org,"As they say in Dune, we need a naming. In this case, it’s of the pervasive scamming that employs far too many resources in the US that could be deployed to just about any better use. I’ll turn to the Equifax 866-662-3339 offense in short order. I am sure it and other grifts mentioned below will be all too familiar to Americans. I wonder if our readers in other countries are subject to anywhere near the level of low level cons that we are.

What has gotten me frosted is that an unconscionably large amount of our economy is participating in attempts to rip off others. One bit of evidence is every week, I receive at least one scam mail piece.

And I now have little sympathy with the people who work in these jobs. The economy is strong enough that there’s no need to work for a business where you are on the front lines of preying on others.

The cancerous growth of this sort of cheating results from toothless laws meant to combat it, like “Do not call” lists and the CAN-SPAM, meant to fill the void left by the effective extermination of class action lawyers. Those bounty-hunters were in the business of going after enterprises that ripped customers off on the pennies to hundreds of dollars each level, but in volume.

John Kenneth Galbraith coined the bezzle, or “an inventory of undiscovered embezzlement,”which is the apparent increase in wealth a victim enjoys after investing in a scam before it collapses. Think Theranos investors.

Common scams have names, such as bait and switch, kiting, Ponzi schemes and of course spam. But there’s a wide-spread type of abuse where the perps get in your face on a fraudulent basis, by misrepresenting their relationship to you, and then seek to extract cash or information.

Moving to Alabama has exposed me to a vast range of commercial chicanery of which I was largely ignorant in my cloistered life in Manhattan. Mind you, I am excluding the barrage of Internet spam I get every day, from the many new improved version of the Nigerian scam, to SEO shysters, to bait and switch ad brokers, to politicians I never heard of hustling me to give to their dipshit campaigns, to publicists pimping for interviews of fourth-tier experts on (mainly not) hot topics, to never-ending “Do you accept guest posts” and “What is your price for a link?” Oh, and dangerous phishing: all sorts of designed-to-generate-panicked clicking of links and documents with God only knows what spy or malware, anything from “Your e-mail account is about to be cancelled” to various supposed fraud or overdraft or big charge notices from financial institutions, to supposed overdue invoices, to tracking information from shippers I never use, to fake order requests. I tune all this stuff out even though I get at least 200 messages like that a day.

The most widespread low level grift seems to be the auto warranty scam, which is so pervasive that it’s become a meme:

So Hiker had a signal… why didn’t get leave voicemails or text too let’s put some onus on all parties… cuz someone from a call center calling from a spoofed number about an auto warranty from another country ain’t invested in my rescue https://t.co/nd0PZaWn3d — 🏳️‍🌈 TraVoloso™️🏳️‍🌈 (@travoloso) October 25, 2021

The fraudster calls or writes telling you your auto warranty is about to expire and you must must renew pronto. I now get both phone messages and letters despite never having owned a car. I can’t fathom what list they bought to get my coordinates, since I was not on their radar in Manhattan.

Another is water line insurance. My mother gets letters almost every month, designed to look governmental, from a Birmingham Water Authority, advising her that her insurance for her water lines (as in the ones on her property, not the municipal pipes) is about to expire. Again she’s never had any such policy.

In New York City, I’d get the electricity scam. A few times a year, from a 718 number, I’d be pitched that I could get my power cheaper if I went from Con Ed to whoever this power provider was. This was a bait and switch; the initial rate is lower but then it jumps to a much higher level, and you are locked in for long enough to come out way worse. But I wasn’t a Con Ed customer; my electricity was included in my rent.

I have also received pitches for veterans’ insurance, which is obviously bogus. My mother gets “renewal” solicitations from charities to which she has never given.

My mother gets so many phising calls, easily ten a day, that she never picks up the phone. One of the worst is “Toll Free Call,” which rings typically three times a day. They never leave a message and keep calling from different numbers, so they can’t be blocked. I left the phone off the hook for days running. That seemed to deter them but they resumed harassing her about ten days later.

Yet another scam is supposed charities calling for donations, most of all police charities. I tell them to send their information in writing. They never do.

Readers have reported more conventional scams. One was being pursued for a debt that had been paid in full seven years ago by his insurer. It turns out the statute of limitations in his state for consumer debt was three years. I told him to write a nastygram telling them to pound sand; sadly you can’t simply ignore that type of abuse. You need to paper the record that you told them their claim is invalid, otherwise they could go to court and try to get a default judgment.

The Equifax fraudsters have me particularly annoyed because they are so persistent. I’ve been getting 2 to 3 voicemails a day, with plenty of red flags that they are up to no good:

The most obvious: false premise, seeking “an employment and income verification for one of your employees” Use of multiple numbers from different area codes for the same robocall. Legitimate enterprises don’t spoof False urgency: “the request is very time sensitive” Fraud-connected callback number. Punching 866-662-3339 into a search engine reveals that this number has been depicted as representing Citibank, Wells Fargo, and other financial institutions and racking up complaints since 2008, such as “vague answers, computer prompts on phone in st louis very tedious, and un easy to use.. somebody fishing for info…BEWARE!!!!” No relationship to Equifax. Equifax lists its “workplace solutions” providers who do income verification. 866-662-3339 is not an Equifax number nor is associated with any of its authorized verification services

At a minimum, they are phishing for business listing information to sell, since they want an e-mail address for “someone authorized to complete the verification”.

A few days ago, I was in a sporting mood and decided right after one of the robocalls to call 866-662-3339, since it had become clear that if I let nature let run its course, I could be in Toll Free Call terrain, getting 2 to 3 rings a day from these louts for the foreseeable future.

866-662-3339 recognized my caller ID. An automated voice double down on the fakery, even said they had two employment checks waiting. Then I was patched over to a live rep. I quickly said I was on a do not call list, they needed to remove my number from their database and stop calling.

I got three calls the next day, but all from the same number this time, so I blocked it. Then a day of no call. Then more calls.

So I tried calling again to tell them I was on a no call list. This simply generated more proof that these guys are con artists.

The person on the other end was clearly not listening and kept pressing for my name and confirmation of my business name. By contrast, nearly all bogus callers will back off fast if you tell them you are on a no-call list, particularly if you sound annoyed.1 You’ve self-identified that you aren’t buying what they are selling, and they will drop the call to try to find a better prospect.

I got angrier with their persistence in not listening and talking over me to extract information. This was another indicator of fraud. Literally every other time in the past five years when I have lost my cool with a call center rep giving me non-responsive bullshit, they’ve either hung up on me or gone into PMC scold-y “you can’t talk to me that way” mode. These people were instructed to keep trying to get the caller to answer their questions, no matter how ugly the caller got, which is a classic sales trick (once a respondent answers a single question, they’ve conceded the other party is in control and that person can start steering the conversation).

Oh, and they mentioned the name of a supposed employee, predictably a name I’d never heard of (and I didn’t say so, I was not giving them any information beyond hearing my voice and my demand).

I hung up, called again, and engaged in a shorter repeat, to confirm the fraudster relentlessness in trying to get me to follow their script.

I tried a new tactic. I called again, intent on having only a one way conversation. I said:

I told you you are making fraudulent calls. I told you I am on the Do Not Call registry. I told you to stop calling me. I am putting earplugs in my ears. I am going to read to you until you hang up.

I then started reading the Declaration of Independence (I had considered The Waste Land).

They hung up almost immediately.

I repeated three times with three different reps.

I am keeping this up until they quit calling me. It’s time these goons have someone waste their time for a change.

Other readers who have have messed with abusive callers, please tell us about your methods.

And I trust those of you in civilized countries aren’t subjected to indignities like scammers who don’t even have the commercial sense to take “no” for an answer.

Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners.

Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

Southwest Airlines credit cards have been made >better and currently have the biggest initial offer we’ve ever seen for them. Chase Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards credit cards are receiving several new features, and their consumer cards all have new 100,000 point initial bonus offers, without taking anything away or raising annual fees.

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card Earn up to 100,000 bonus points: 50,000 bonus points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first 3 months your account is open, plus 50,000 more bonus points after spending $12,000 total on purchases in the first 12 months. ($69 annual fee)

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card Earn up to 100,000 bonus points: 50,000 bonus points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first 3 months your account is open, plus 50,000 more bonus points after spending $12,000 total on purchases in the first 12 months. ($99 annual fee)

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card Earn up to 100,000 bonus points: 50,000 bonus points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first 3 months your account is open, plus 50,000 more bonus points after spending $12,000 total on purchases in the first 12 months. ($149 annual fee)

Earning the full bonus requires an average of just $1000 spend on the card per month. I am looking to get the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card because I’m a semi-regular Southwest Airlines flyer (they’re the largest carrier at my home airport in Austin) so the benefits of the card are worth more than its fee to me. Someone interested primarily in points will likely focus on the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card which has the lowest annual fee.

Perfect Timing To Use These Offers For A Companion Pass

The timing for these offers is perfect because applying for a new card now allows you to time the earning of your initial bonus for early in 2022. You can get a huge head start on a Companion Pass which lasts for the rest of the calendar year in which it is earned and for the entire next year .

I earned a Companion Pass in January 2020, that was then valid for all of 2020 and all of 2021. I’m told I was one of the very first to earn it that year. Little did I know I wouldn’t get as much use out of it as I’d hoped (thanks, pandemic) but I’m excited to earn one again.

That’s because the Companion Pass allows you you to bring a second person along with you on your travels – whether your ticket is paid for with cash or with points. You need to earn 125,000 eligible points in 2021 for a pass that will be valid through the end of 2022. And Southwest credit card initial bonuses and points-earning from spend on those cards count towards companion pass.

Details On The Three Southwest Consumer Cards

Southwest has added features to each of its three consumer credit cards from Chase, and made similar changes to its corresponding small business cards. Here’s what you need to know about the three consumer products which have this big up front offer.

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card. This is the premium Southwest Airlines co-brand card really designed for folks who fly Southwest — it makes Southwest travel better, and spending helps earn both A-List status and a Companion Pass®. Now there’s also no cap on the elite qualifying points you can earn through spend as well (you earn 1500 qualifying points per $10,000 spend, calculated based on billing cycle end days). Ongoing category bonus spend includes 3X points on Southwest® purchases; 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on internet, cable, phone services, and select streaming. The card provides a $75 Southwest® travel credit each year; 25% back on in-flight drinks, WiFi, messaging, and movies; and 4 upgraded Boardings per year when available (when A1-15 boarding positions are offered at the gate, buy it and you’ll receive a statement credit for the charge); and 7,500 anniversary points each year.

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card This has the lowest annual fee of the three cards, but still has the same initial bonus offer right now. Ongoing category bonus spend: 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on internet, cable, phone services, and select streaming; 2X points on Southwest purchases. You earn 3,000 anniversary points each year, a nice incentive to keep the card. It also comes with 2 EarlyBird Check-In credits each year.

Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card The mid-tier card of the three has the same initial bonus offer as the other two, it offers a little more value than the base card, but it does feel a bit caught in the middle. It also comes with 2 EarlyBird Check-In credits each year. Ongoing bonus category spend: 3X points on Southwest purchases; 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on internet, cable, phone services, and select streaming. You earn 6,000 anniversary points each year (after your cardmember anniversary), a nice incentive to keep the card.

Which Card To Get?

As I say I find the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card to be best, since i’ll use the benefits of the card flying Southwest. The annual travel credit alone makes the net cost to me similar to the lowest annual fee card offered, without even valuing its extra benefits.

However if you’re just looking at points versus annual fee then Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card becomes most attractive.

What I like about Southwest is that they have no change fees, you can use your points even to make a speculative booking. It’s always great to have Southwest points around, even if you book mostly international award tickets. You might need a domestic flight to get to the city your international award ticket leaves from. Or book the Southwest flight, and if award availability opens up to include a domestic flight on your other ticket, great, there’s no change fees. Southwest points are great insurance. They don’t have other fees either like checked bag fees or change fees.",19/10/2021,Citibank,"Southwest Airlines credit cards have been made >better and currently have the biggest initial offer we’ve ever seen for them.
And Southwest credit card initial bonuses and points-earning from spend on those cards count towards companion pass.
