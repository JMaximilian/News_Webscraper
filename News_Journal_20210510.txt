The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles. But despite the intense interest, the era of the new car is a hyper-competitive one in China, and tech giants have a lot to prove.“There’s a big element of faith in the tech companies’ bets,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director of consultancy AlixPartners in Shanghai and a former Ford Motor Co. executive. “This is a matter of creating something new that doesn’t exist now. That’s where the element of faith comes into play.”Huawei has been at the fore, recently announcing plans to invest $1 billion in EVs and its own self-driving technology, which it claims has “already surpassed” electric car pioneer Tesla Inc. in some aspects.The Shenzhen-based company, better known for its mobile-phone networks and being the subject of crippling U.S. sanctions, has unveiled its first car developed with BAIC BluePark Mew Energy Technology Co. The mid-sized Arcfox S sedan uses HI, or Huawei Inside, an intelligent automotive software package that enables it to run on autonomous driving mode in city areas for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) without human intervention. Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there. On top of that, for some there’s the opportunity to charge for tech add-ons and system improvements, essentially treating the vehicle like a piece of computer hardware that constantly gets its software updated.“They will definitely focus on being intelligent,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Autoforesight Co. “Making a good electrified car is a ‘pass,’ while making a good intelligent car will make an ‘A-grade.’ That’s what these tech giants are good at. Their main revenue will not be from selling the car but finding other ways to earn post-sale, such as over-the-air system upgrades or software subscriptions.”Big Tech in China Is Eyeing EVs for a Reason: Hyperdrive DailyFirst MoversBaidu -- which started investing in robo-taxi technology as early as 2013 and funded Chinese EV startup WM Motors -- now plans to spend $7.7 billion over the next five years developing smart-car technology via its newly established unit Jidu Auto. The division aims to launch its first model in three years, followed by new releases every 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Xia Yiping said.“The core value of cars in the future will be how intelligent they are,” Xia said, echoing a familiar refrain. “The earlier a company plans, the more control of self-developed technologies it gains, the more advanced technology it has, the more power it will own in the market.”Jidu has a core team of about 100 staff, and will expand to as many as 3,000 personnel by the end of next year, including up to 500 software engineers, he said. The first batch of cars will be based on Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s pure EV manufacturing structure, while Jidu will collaborate with Baidu’s autonomous-driving unit Apollo, with a special focus on smart cars and the mass production of autonomous driving features. The unit will embark on its next fundraising round soon, with further investment expected from Baidu and external investors.Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has also announced plans to invest about $10 billion over the next decade to manufacture electric cars, though hasn’t disclosed much detail or given a timeframe for deliveries. Billionaire co-founder Lei Jun in March announced his intention to lead a new standalone division and spearhead the drive into EVs, in what he called his final major startup endeavor.“We have deep pockets for this project,” Lei, who is also Xiaomi’s chief executive officer, said when unveiling the plan. “I’m fully aware of the risks of the car-making industry. I’m also aware the project will take at least three-to-five years with tens of billions of investment.”While China’s tech giants may be late to the game and entering unfamiliar territory, that could play to their advantage, said Dyer of AlixPartners.“This isn’t an industry where you have to be the first-mover to win,” he said. “In fact, in the auto industry, the first mover typically never wins. It’s always the follower who wins. Because when you are the first mover, you’re the one paying to learn through all the mistakes.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['car', 'china', 'cars', 'giants', 'intelligent', 'earnings', 'thats', 'huawei', 'technology', 'host', 'ecopetrol', 'tech', 'plans']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

The win was Caledonia’s fourth straight, as they improved to 3-1, 4-1. They’ve scored 10-plus runs in all four wins. FCL fell to 0-5, 0-7.GMLOK Teams Double Sweep in HoustonTuesday the 20th of April had GMLOK’s baseball and softball teams trekking to Houston for a pair of doubleheaders. The Bulldogs swept the series, each squad doing so in a different way. On the softball diamond, it was all about GMLOK senior pitcher Lily Hughes. In game one, she tossed a 14-strikeout, two-hit, shut-out (7 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 14 K). John Fenske’s group won 6-0. Frosh Lucie Voigt (3-4, 2B, 3 R) led the offense, with help from Emily Miner (1-3, 2 R), Zoe Scrabeck (1-4, 2 RBI, R), and Kelly Hanson (1-3, 2 RBI). Lilly Carr and Emma Chapel were each 1-for-3 for Houston. Game two saw Hughes pitch a five-inning no-hitter (5 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, Win). Team GM collected six hits and six walks to post a 12-0 win in five. Scrabeck (1-1, RBI, 3 R), Voigt (1-2, 2 R), Miner (1-2, RBI, 2 R), Alexys Harwood (1-1, RBI, R) and Hughes (1-3, R) did work offensively. Becca Rostad (0-1, BB, ROE) reached twice for Houston. The win was part of a 3-0 week for GMLOK softball, as they also beat AC/GE 14-3 (See “Hot Shots” and “Softball” for more). Across the way on the baseball diamond, GM senior Dustin Copley provided big offense in both games. GMLOK took game one 7-1 (in five innings). Copley (1-3, HR, 2 RBI, R) hit his first home run of the year. Lucas Heusinkveld (5 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 6 BB, 5 K, Win) didn’t surrender a hit on the mound while helping offensively (2-2, 2B, 2 R). Connor Munson (2-3, 2 RBI, R), Christian Jacobsen (1-3, RBI), and Devin Carr (1-3, R) aided the “O.” Houston’s only run came as Caiden Olson scored on an Alex Walters RBI. Olson (5 IP, 8 H, 7 R, 5 ER, 2 BB, 8 K) took the loss. Game two had GMLOK win 14-4 in five. Copley (2-2, HR, 4 RBI, 3 R) went yard again. Heusinkveld (2-4, 2 RBI, 3 R), Munson (1-1, 2 RBI, 3 BBs), and Carr (1-4, 2 RBI, R) helped at the plate. Nick Fetterly (5 IP, 3 H, 4 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 7 K) picked up the win doing dual work (1-1, RBI, 4 R). Arik Melbo (2-3, 2B, RBI, R), Olson (1-2, RBI, R), and Connor Porter (0-3, 2 RBI) led Houston.Track/Field Teams Post WinsFor the second time in as many weeks, multiple “Journal 11” track teams won meets, albeit smaller ones with less teams (per COVID). Both LFCMC’s teams, GMLOKS’ girls, RPH’s girls, and Chatfield’s boys were winners.On Thursday, the GM-quad-share took on the Glen Amundsen Invite in Stewartville.

The Gophers topped RPH’s boys on April 15 as well.*, **, and *** denote only one, two, or three competitor events.Gophers Teams Sweep FC/L, R-PChatfield’s ball teams did the R-P and FC/L swoop/sweep on Tuesday the 20th and Thursday the 22nd. Softball racked up two one-sided wins. Hosting R-P, the Gophers prevailed 14-4 in five innings. Peyton Berg (3-4, 2B, HR, 3 RBI, 2 R) was the hitting hero, smacking her second long ball of the year. Kara Goetzinger (3-3, 2B, 2 RBI, 3 R), Alexis Hinckley (2-3, 2B, 2 R), Brynn Irish (1-2, 2B, RBI), and Bryn Van Dyke (0-2, 3 RBI, R) also did “O” work. Jaiden Zimmerman (4 IP, 1 H, 4 R, 2 ER, 5 BB, 8 K) collected the win whilst chipping in a couple RBIs (0-3, R). Ellie Ekern (0-1, RBI, R), Hailey Jenkins (1-2, R), and Brooke Johnson (1-2, RBI) led the Trojans. The Gophers then trekked to Preston. Through five innings, the score was 4-0 on the strength of Zimmerman’s first career home run, a grand slam. It was one of four Gopher hits through five innings. But Chatfield had a five-hit, six-run sixth. They prevailed 11-2. Zimmerman (2-5, 2B, GS-HR, 5 RBI, 3 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 5 K) and Goetzinger (3-4, 2B, RBI) had multiple hits. Berg (1-3, 2B, RBI), Tatum Allen (1-2, 2 R), and Irish (1-2, 3B, 3 RBI, R) got in on the offense. Claire Springer (4 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 5 K) collected the win. Regan Hanson (2-3, RBI), Kaci Ruen (1-2, 2B), Ellie Anderson (1-3, R), Hope Sexton (1-3, 2B), and Addie Peters (4 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, Loss) did work for FC/L. Jerry Chase’s group improved to 4-0, 6-1. The baseball team used the dual performance of Caden Nolte to take down the Trojans. The senior (3-4, 2B, 4 RBI) drove in four and got the win (3 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 3 K). The Gophers blew a 5-2 game open with a nine-run fourth. Chatfield prevailed 14-3 in five innings. Austin Koenigs (3-4, 3B, 3 RBI, R) was Nolte’s best help. Henry Gathje (2-3, 3 R), Ben Fretland (1-3, RBI, 2 R, 2 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB), Tate Karver (1-3, 2B, R), and Connor Jax (2-4, 2 RBI, R) also did work. R-P was led by Alex Ronnenberg (1-2, R) and Logan Skalet (1-3, 2B). Chatfield then took out FC/L. A three-run third had the Falcons up 3-2, but Brian Baum’s group scored four in their third and nine in the fourth. They led 15-3. FC/L staved off five-inning defeat with a three-run fifth. The final was 15-8 in a game that featured 13 combined errors. Drew O’Connor (2-3, 3B, 5 RBI) and Gathje (2-4, 2B, 5 RBI) each drove in five runs. The latter collected the win (4 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 3 K). Max Aug (2-4, two 2Bs, 2 R) and Tate Karver (2-3, 2 RBI, R) had multiple hits while Seth Goetzinger (1-2, 3 R, 2 BB), Fretland (1-1, 3 R, 2 BB), and Cory Ericson (1-2, RBI, 2 R) helped. Dillon O’Connor (2-5, RBI, 2 R), Gunner Benson (2-5, RBI, R), and Ty Sexton (2-4, RBI, R, 2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 0 K, No Decision) had multiple hits for FC/L.Hot ShotsCaledonia standout Eli King has signed to play college basketball at Iowa State University. King was recruited by new Cyclone Head Coach T.J. Otzelberger, who was the head guy at South Dakota State. SDSU is where Eli’s older brother Owen played basketball, where other older brother Noah committed to. Otzelberger recruited both. Noah reneged on SDSU, going to Kirkwood Junior College (IA). He averaged 9.6 PPG this past year as a frosh. Owen has since transferred to Winona State. It’ll be a change for Eli King. ISU went 2-22 this past season. GMLOK softball posted a 3-0 week. Senior pitcher Lilly Hughes collected all three wins in impressive fashion (18 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 27 K). The Bulldogs (3-1, 4-1) trail Randolph (4-0, 10-0) and are virtually tied with AC/G-E (5-1, 6-2) atop the SEC. Cal/SG softball beat FC/L 8-7, but only after the Falcons rallied from down 7-1 (put the tying run on third in the seventh). Falcon Lauren Mensink was 4-for-5. Game two was called tied 11-11 through eight innings. Warriors Ashley Ideker and Amber Stemper hit home runs. It was Cal/SG’s second and third homers of the week.

The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles. But despite the intense interest, the era of the new car is a hyper-competitive one in China, and tech giants have a lot to prove.“There’s a big element of faith in the tech companies’ bets,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director of consultancy AlixPartners in Shanghai and a former Ford Motor Co. executive. “This is a matter of creating something new that doesn’t exist now. That’s where the element of faith comes into play.”Huawei has been at the fore, recently announcing plans to invest $1 billion in EVs and its own self-driving technology, which it claims has “already surpassed” electric car pioneer Tesla Inc. in some aspects.The Shenzhen-based company, better known for its mobile-phone networks and being the subject of crippling U.S. sanctions, has unveiled its first car developed with BAIC BluePark Mew Energy Technology Co. The mid-sized Arcfox S sedan uses HI, or Huawei Inside, an intelligent automotive software package that enables it to run on autonomous driving mode in city areas for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) without human intervention. Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there. On top of that, for some there’s the opportunity to charge for tech add-ons and system improvements, essentially treating the vehicle like a piece of computer hardware that constantly gets its software updated.“They will definitely focus on being intelligent,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Autoforesight Co. “Making a good electrified car is a ‘pass,’ while making a good intelligent car will make an ‘A-grade.’ That’s what these tech giants are good at. Their main revenue will not be from selling the car but finding other ways to earn post-sale, such as over-the-air system upgrades or software subscriptions.”Big Tech in China Is Eyeing EVs for a Reason: Hyperdrive DailyFirst MoversBaidu -- which started investing in robo-taxi technology as early as 2013 and funded Chinese EV startup WM Motors -- now plans to spend $7.7 billion over the next five years developing smart-car technology via its newly established unit Jidu Auto. The division aims to launch its first model in three years, followed by new releases every 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Xia Yiping said.“The core value of cars in the future will be how intelligent they are,” Xia said, echoing a familiar refrain. “The earlier a company plans, the more control of self-developed technologies it gains, the more advanced technology it has, the more power it will own in the market.”Jidu has a core team of about 100 staff, and will expand to as many as 3,000 personnel by the end of next year, including up to 500 software engineers, he said. The first batch of cars will be based on Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s pure EV manufacturing structure, while Jidu will collaborate with Baidu’s autonomous-driving unit Apollo, with a special focus on smart cars and the mass production of autonomous driving features. The unit will embark on its next fundraising round soon, with further investment expected from Baidu and external investors.Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has also announced plans to invest about $10 billion over the next decade to manufacture electric cars, though hasn’t disclosed much detail or given a timeframe for deliveries. Billionaire co-founder Lei Jun in March announced his intention to lead a new standalone division and spearhead the drive into EVs, in what he called his final major startup endeavor.“We have deep pockets for this project,” Lei, who is also Xiaomi’s chief executive officer, said when unveiling the plan. “I’m fully aware of the risks of the car-making industry. I’m also aware the project will take at least three-to-five years with tens of billions of investment.”While China’s tech giants may be late to the game and entering unfamiliar territory, that could play to their advantage, said Dyer of AlixPartners.“This isn’t an industry where you have to be the first-mover to win,” he said. “In fact, in the auto industry, the first mover typically never wins.

As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there.

Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled.

The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there.

The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles.

The university city of Cambridge tops the list followed by Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Exeter, Bristol, Dundee, Reading, Leeds, Edinburgh and finally Newcastle completing the top 10.The ranking has been generated through BNP Paribas Real Estate’s unique location analysis model, Next X, which draws on a series of environmental data to determine how well these locations perform against these criteria.Next X looked at aspects such as supply of environmentally friendly office space, (BREEAM rated), in these locations as well as ultra-low emissions vehicle (ULEV) usage and access to electric vehicle charging stations. It also reviewed supply of cycle parking spaces at rail stations and air quality at these places across the UK.Cambridge tops the list thanks to factors including boasting the highest level of bicycle parking available (over 220 spaces per 10,000 people) and a three-fold increase in use of ULEVs in the past four years. When it comes to four-wheeled transport, Milton Keynes services electric car users well, with over 34 EV charging points per 100,000 people (against the top twenty average of 10.6), while Exeter has seen the highest growth in the use of ULEVs in the past four years at over 800 per cent. Outside London, the number of BREEAM-rated office buildings is highest in Manchester, followed by Glasgow, Newcastle and Birmingham.Growing evidence, in the UK and further afield, suggests that sustainable offices are retaining both higher rental and investment values. Locations with strong supply of certified green offices are therefore more likely to attract both businesses, talent and investment.Over 50 per cent of European respondents in RICS Q3 2020: Global Commercial Property Monitor survey believed that occupier demand for buildings with Green Building Certifications has risen in the past year and over 60 per cent believed that investor demand for sustainable buildings had increased during the same period. 40 per cent respondents also thought that green buildings would receive a rent premium compared to non-certified buildings.A survey featured in KPMG’s report ‘Real Estate in the New Reality’ found that 83 per cent of real estate professionals believed that COVID-19 will generate a significant increase in tenants’ demand for sustainable and environmental-friendly buildings. It also found that 85 per cent either were planning to change their portfolio strategy to focus more on sustainable investments or were already focused on ESG as a criteria.Stephen Wolfe, Head of Commercial, BNP Paribas Real Estate, says: “ESG and the return to the office are the most talked about topics right now, and both are very much interlinked. Covid-19 has made senior business leaders think carefully about the purpose of the office and how it is used. Going forward, the office certainly has a place in supporting business’ success yet it needs to offer much more than desks. The focus will be on creative working environments that offer a reason to come together and collaborate in person. This is why locations with a strong offer of quality sustainable offices with great facilities are attracting both businesses and talent.”","['real', 'sustainable', 'buildings', 'office', 'supply', 'model', 'locations', 'estates', 'desirable', 'estate', 'green', 'tops', 'live', 'cent', 'past', 'work', 'paribas', 'location']",2021-05-05,,LCH SA

REUTERS/Giorgio PerottinoConcise insights on global finance.-----------------------------------------------CALM BEFORE THE STORM. Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) has bolstered its bad credit defences. Italy’s largest lender on Wednesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit of 1.5 billion euros . It’s the bank’s best quarter since 2008, delivering an annualised return on tangible equity of 12%, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The performance owes much to lower bad debt provisions. Intesa set aside some 400 million euros, equivalent to 0.35% of total loans on an annualised basis. That’s less than some European rivals.Boss Carlo Messina and investors know the lull won’t last. Intesa shares trade at around 0.8 times its tangible book value, implying an 8% return on tangible equity this year. Once Italy lifts a ban on layoffs, many private clients will default. Yet, as consumer credit accounts for just 6% of its loans, less than half the equivalent share for BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Intesa is better placed to weather an increase in defaults.

Shareholders in Société Générale (SOGN.PA) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are unaccustomed to good news. The perennial European bank laggards bucked the habit on Thursday with blowout first-quarter results. Frédéric Oudéa’s French lender reported a juicy 10.1% return on tangible equity, after stripping out one-off charges. UniCredit’s new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel unveiled a less stellar but still respectable 6.9% ROTE, also on an underlying basis. Both banks’ shares rose 4%.It’s unlikely to last. Both Oudéa and Orcel expect bad-debt charges to rise in the rest of the year. Revenues from investment banking will probably fall as market volatility subsides. Meanwhile analysts reckon SocGen’s costs will consume 73% of 2021 income, compared with BNP Paribas’ (BNPP.PA) 68%. UniCredit’s equivalent ratio of 58% is much worse than Intesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP.MI) 52%. Little wonder the French and Italian banks respectively trade at a 38% and 54% discount to their two closest rivals, using price to forward tangible book value. Oudéa and Orcel will remain stuck at the bottom of the class.

REUTERS/Stefanos KouratzisEgypt has signed a contract with France to buy 30 Rafale fighter jets, its defence ministry said in a statement early on Tuesday, in a deal that investigative website Disclose said on Monday was worth 3.75 billion euro ($4.5 billion).President Emmanuel Macron said in December he would not make the sale of weapons to Egypt conditional on human rights because he did not want to weaken Cairo's ability to counter terrorism in the region, a comment that drew the ire of critics.Egypt's defense ministry said the deal would be financed through a loan to be re-paid over at least 10 years, but did not disclose the value of the deal or further details.Citing confidential documents, Disclose said an agreement had been concluded at the end of April and a deal could be sealed on Tuesday when an Egyptian delegation arrives in Paris.This deal would be a further boost for the Dassault-made (AVMD.PA) warplane after a 2.5 billion euro agreement was finalised in January for the sale of 18 Rafales to Greece.The Egyptian accord also reportedly covers contracts for missile provider MBDA and equipment provider Safran Electronics & Defense (SAF.PA) which are worth another 200 million euros.France's finance, foreign and armed forces ministries were not immediately available for comment.France was the main weapons supplier to Egypt between 2013-2017, including the sale of 24 warplanes with an option for 12 more.

The banks were not immediately available for comment.Concerned by the political vacuum in Libya, instability across the region and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, both countries have cultivated closer economic and military ties since Sisi's rise to power.Rights organisations have accused Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi's government.French officials dismiss this and say Paris is following a policy of not openly criticising countries over human rights so as to be more effective in private on a case-by-case basis.($1 = 0.83 euros)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","['jets', 'human', 'sell', 'ministry', 'egypt', 'sale', 'egyptian', 'defense', 'deal', 'rights', 'report', 'rafale', 'disclose', 'france', 'fighter']",2021-05-03,,LCH SA

He explains here how autonomous vehicles can bring life and economic dynamism back to the parts of France that need it most. Yann is also Chairman of the Digital Commission and the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles working group of the French Insurance Federation.We need to think differently about AVsMention ‘Autonomous Vehicle’ and most people picture a man – probably white and possibly a busy executive – reading the news, or replying to emails, while his luxury electric vehicle navigates the traffic by itself. This reality is already upon us, with many automakers releasing Level 3 (conditional automation) vehicles into the market.According to this image, AVs are a natural continuation of the classic single-car-ownership model; i.e. a technological disruption that does not address the social and economic issues of our day.The Movin’On Community of Interest is a working group that brings together several ecosystem stakeholders to develop a common vision and experiment new mobility solutions togethers. We are leading one of them, dedicated to shifting the discussion away from technological advance for its own sake and toward the use of technology to promote social good.Movin’On toward sustainable and inclusive mobilityMovin’On, created and inspired by Michelin, is gathering collective and individual change makers and giving them the means to innovate together for more mobility with less impact. Besides Macif and Michelin, there are other major players from the private sector involved in the Community of Interest to recontextualize mobility innovation in terms of social impact. These include BNP Paribas Cardif, Deloitte, Faurecia, Kantar, Maif, Microsoft, Orange, SNCF and Vinci; as well as key actors from government, civil society and the scientific community.Movin’On has numerous interdisciplinary teams within its LAB, a think and do tank, engaged in answering questions like: ‘How to reshape last mile delivery operations and experience for good?’ and ‘How can we securely share data to create value and improve sustainable mobility?’. Our Community of Interest is dedicated to answering: ‘How can we encourage the adoption of autonomous vehicles through sustainable and inclusive mobility insights?’.Technopush versus Social SolidarityIn 2020, we participated in studies carried out by the Védécom Institute, who specialise in the subject of mobility and autonomy. One of our striking findings was that there is overwhelming bias in the media and the popular imagination for ‘technopush’, whereby technology – not social good – drives interest and publicity. Of the 100 000 or so articles on AVs we came across, only 185 discussed the social impact of this new technology and the possibilities for inclusive and sustainable transport.It’s a bit like social media, which was first seen as an unvarnished good, before – as Gartner’s Hype Cycle describes it – the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ gave way to the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’. Our research suggests that the French public intuits the potential for disillusionment; they’re prepared to support AVs, so long as they prove to be safe and that they expand employment opportunities and reduce environmental impact.Interestingly, rural areas were less supportive of AVs. But if we have our way, these environments will benefit greatly from cheap, efficient, carbon-light solutions to getting around, finding work and building communities.AVs as a solution to economic decline in sparsely populated areasHow can we convince the public, as well as major institutional players, that the real opportunity for AVs is not as a continuation of the traditional mobility model, but as a positive disruption that boosts local economies and expands access to millions of the underserved? This notion is encapsulated in our Movin’On Community of Interest motto: ‘Mobility for all, Autonomy for all’.We believe this can be achieved by using AV technology for shared electric shuttles that mix on-demand elements of ride-hailing with traditional public transport elements of routes and timetables. If a country like France – which has large areas that are sparsely populated – can get this right, it will do unimaginable good for those outlying towns, villages and suburbs where millions find their lives and livelihoods constrained by lack of mobility options.I live in Coulonges-sur-L’Autize, a small village 25-minutes’ drive north of MACIF’s headquarters in Niort. It’s a joy to live close to a Regional Natural Park (Marais Poitevin) and not too far from the beauty spots along the Bay of Biscay coastline. And yet I see that a village or small town can be a prison for those – be they a single mother or elderly couple – without ready access to mobility.We will know that the initiative has succeeded when we’ve increased the sharing of assets, decreased environmental impact, and rejuvenated business and social activity in the high street, particularly for smaller towns and villages.The commercial viability of autonomous vehiclesIf shared autonomous shuttles really are key to reversing the decline of peri-urban areas, then why don’t we see the big OEMs talking more about it? Clearly, the commercial argument for the solution has not been properly made. Our committee is of the opinion that not only can AVs improve mobility access for underserved areas, but that the model is commercially viable.Currently, AVs are expensive because the data and intelligence must be self-contained in the vehicle. But if AVs operated within a geofenced area, along discrete routes and supervised centrally, then the intelligence and data would be shared across the system, reducing costs. If this solution for a certain suburb or village proves to be scalable, then it means we could duplicate the model across the country.Explore, prepare, testOur Community of Interest began in 2020 and rolls out of three yearly phases: explore, prepare and test. By 2022 we should be able to verify if indeed a replicable model for widespread AV use in sparse areas is possible. In the meantime, it’s important that insurance companies like Macif consider the risk and liability problems posed by AVs.In the future, it’s possible that an autonomous system will reduce accident risk to zero. But current reality says AVs and non-AVs are going to be operating on the same roads for some years to come. With fears around automation and artificial intelligence relegating humans to irrelevance, it is important that a company like Macif – which was founded for mutual benefit in protection of life, family and property – leads the discussion.AVs are set to disrupt millions of truck-driving, delivery and ride-hailing jobs. We need to think about how technology can ameliorate the digital divide and expand opportunities to those on the margins of economic activity. There is no reason why a country like France cannot use AVs to boost economic dynamism and social activity in sparsely populated areas, improving the lives of millions.Do EVs excite your electrons?

The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles. But despite the intense interest, the era of the new car is a hyper-competitive one in China, and tech giants have a lot to prove.“There’s a big element of faith in the tech companies’ bets,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director of consultancy AlixPartners in Shanghai and a former Ford Motor Co. executive. “This is a matter of creating something new that doesn’t exist now. That’s where the element of faith comes into play.”Huawei has been at the fore, recently announcing plans to invest $1 billion in EVs and its own self-driving technology, which it claims has “already surpassed” electric car pioneer Tesla Inc. in some aspects.The Shenzhen-based company, better known for its mobile-phone networks and being the subject of crippling U.S. sanctions, has unveiled its first car developed with BAIC BluePark Mew Energy Technology Co. The mid-sized Arcfox S sedan uses HI, or Huawei Inside, an intelligent automotive software package that enables it to run on autonomous driving mode in city areas for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) without human intervention. Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there. On top of that, for some there’s the opportunity to charge for tech add-ons and system improvements, essentially treating the vehicle like a piece of computer hardware that constantly gets its software updated.“They will definitely focus on being intelligent,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Autoforesight Co. “Making a good electrified car is a ‘pass,’ while making a good intelligent car will make an ‘A-grade.’ That’s what these tech giants are good at. Their main revenue will not be from selling the car but finding other ways to earn post-sale, such as over-the-air system upgrades or software subscriptions.”Big Tech in China Is Eyeing EVs for a Reason: Hyperdrive DailyFirst MoversBaidu -- which started investing in robo-taxi technology as early as 2013 and funded Chinese EV startup WM Motors -- now plans to spend $7.7 billion over the next five years developing smart-car technology via its newly established unit Jidu Auto. The division aims to launch its first model in three years, followed by new releases every 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Xia Yiping said.“The core value of cars in the future will be how intelligent they are,” Xia said, echoing a familiar refrain. “The earlier a company plans, the more control of self-developed technologies it gains, the more advanced technology it has, the more power it will own in the market.”Jidu has a core team of about 100 staff, and will expand to as many as 3,000 personnel by the end of next year, including up to 500 software engineers, he said. The first batch of cars will be based on Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s pure EV manufacturing structure, while Jidu will collaborate with Baidu’s autonomous-driving unit Apollo, with a special focus on smart cars and the mass production of autonomous driving features. The unit will embark on its next fundraising round soon, with further investment expected from Baidu and external investors.Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has also announced plans to invest about $10 billion over the next decade to manufacture electric cars, though hasn’t disclosed much detail or given a timeframe for deliveries. Billionaire co-founder Lei Jun in March announced his intention to lead a new standalone division and spearhead the drive into EVs, in what he called his final major startup endeavor.“We have deep pockets for this project,” Lei, who is also Xiaomi’s chief executive officer, said when unveiling the plan. “I’m fully aware of the risks of the car-making industry. I’m also aware the project will take at least three-to-five years with tens of billions of investment.”While China’s tech giants may be late to the game and entering unfamiliar territory, that could play to their advantage, said Dyer of AlixPartners.“This isn’t an industry where you have to be the first-mover to win,” he said. “In fact, in the auto industry, the first mover typically never wins. It’s always the follower who wins. Because when you are the first mover, you’re the one paying to learn through all the mistakes.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['real', 'huawei', 'netherlands', 'activepure', 'car', 'china', 'cars', 'giants', 'intelligent', 'bnp', 'partners', 'estate', 'thats', 'technology', 'tech', 'paribas', 'plans']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

Not so in Asia though, where MSCI Inc.’s key gauge for this category of shares has returned more than 9 per cent so far this year, beating the broader regional benchmark by almost five percentage points.The index, which excludes the Japanese market and is heavily weighted to financials, information technology and materials companies, has also outperformed value stocks, a favorite of many investors the world over this year. Reasons for the strength range from a recovery in banks on expectations for higher interest rates to the rally in Taiwanese tech stocks.“We expect economic growth to rebound strongly in the next 2-3 years, potentially achieving its highest rate for decades as pent up demand is released and policy settings remain expansionary,” said Jeffrey Roskell, a portfolio manager for the JPMorgan Asia Equity Dividend Fund. “Profitability and dividends are set to recover.”The outperformance of stocks with better income potential has also come as confidence in the outlook returns to company boardrooms in Asia, with about 45 per cent of stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index resuming or increasing dividends this year versus the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

By contrast, there are doubts about the earnings and payout sustainability of Chinese property and office real estate investment trusts, Raychaudhuri said.Roskell’s fund, which has a yield of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent and has outperformed the regional benchmark so far this year, has been rotating out of defensive stocks into value names lately on expectations of early economic recovery and higher interest rates.Some others are more optimistic.“The dividend-paying element in a stock points us to quality -- a synonym of balance sheet resilience and stability in operations,” said Frank Tsui, a senior fund manager at Value Partners who is involved in the firm’s high-dividend strategy.

Egypt’s defence ministry revealed the deal in a statement early on Tuesday.President Emmanuel Macron said in December he would not make the sale of weapons to Egypt conditional on a commitment to respect human rights because he did not want to weaken Cairo’s ability to counter violence in the region.Egypt’s defence ministry said the deal would be financed through a loan to be repaid over at least 10 years but did not give details about the value of the deal or any other information.Citing confidential documents, Disclose said an agreement had been concluded at the end of April and could be sealed on Tuesday when an Egyptian delegation arrives in Paris.This deal would be a further boost for the Dassault-made fighter jet after a $3.01bn agreement was finalised in January for the sale of 18 Rafales jets to Greece.Qatar and India have also signed agreements with France, turning the plane into one of the country’s main defence industry successes.The Egyptian accord also reportedly covers contracts for missile manufacturer MBDA and equipment provider Safran Electronics & Defense which are worth another $241m.France’s finance, foreign and armed forces ministries were not immediately available for comment.Encouraging ruthless repressionFrance was the main weapons supplier to Egypt between 2013-2017, including the sale of 24 warplanes with an option for 12 more.Those contracts dried up, however, including deals that had been at an advanced stage for more Rafale jets and warships.Diplomats said that was as much to do with financing issues over fears about Cairo’s long-term ability to repay state-backed guaranteed loans, rather than any concerns Paris had with the human rights situation in Egypt.Benedicte Jeannerod, the Human Rights Watch director for France, condemned the deal outright.The deal came in the wake of a hugely contentious state visit to Paris by Egypt’s el-Sisi in December hosted by Macron [File: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters] “By signing a mega-arms contract with [Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-] Sisi’s government while the latter presides over the worst repression in decades in Egypt, the eradication of the human rights community in the country and undertakes extremely serious violations under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, France is only encouraging this ruthless repression,” Jeannerod told the Reuters news agency.Disclose said financing for the deal would be up to 85 percent guaranteed by the French state with BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and CIC, which funded the original deal, signing up again. The banks were not immediately available for comment.Concerned by the political vacuum in Libya, instability across the region and the threat from armed groups in Egypt, both countries have cultivated closer economic and military ties since el-Sisi’s rise to power.Human rights organisations have accused Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by el-Sisi’s government.French officials say Paris is following a policy of not openly criticising countries over human rights so as to be more effective in private on a case-by-case basis.While Egypt has around $125 billion external debt, its military leader buys more weapons for nothing but his enhancing his image, prestige, and appeasing western allies.France to sell Egypt 30 fighter jets in $4.5 bln deal -report  — Dr.Khalil al-ِِAnani د. خليل العناني (Khalilalanani) May 3, 2021The deal also came in the wake of a hugely contentious state visit to Paris by el-Sisi in December hosted by Macron.Egypt and France have enjoyed an increasingly close relationship under the secular rule of former army general el-Sisi, with common interests in the Middle East and a shared suspicion of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Macron decorated el-Sisi with France’s highest honour, the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, during the visit.That enraged activists who had asked him not to roll out the red carpet but instead to raise concerns about the estimated 60,000 political prisoners languishing in Egyptian prisons.The French president also ruled out making France’s deepening defence and trade ties with Egypt conditional on the issue of rights.“I think it is more effective to have a policy of dialogue than a policy of boycott which would reduce the effectiveness of one of our partners in the fight against terrorism and for regional stability,” Macron said.","['jets', 'human', 'egypt', 'elsisi', 'rights', 'deal', 'worth', 'buy', '45bn', 'rafale', 'france', 'fighter', 'macron', 'paris', 'president']",2021-05-04,,LCH SA

Ou encore qu’ « avec un volume de transactions similaire au premier trimestre 2020, l’offre disponible à un an connait une hausse de 14 % sur un an et représente désormais 1,71 million de mètres carrés ».Un constat qui « concerne aussi bien l’offre neuve (+22 %, soit 605 300 m²) que celle de seconde main (+10 %, soit 1,1 million de m²). Ce qui fait dire à Jean-Laurent de La Prade que « les bureaux devront répondre aux nouveaux usages afin d’attirer les salariés, en proposant une qualité architecturale irréprochable, avec des espaces extérieurs et un soin particulier sur le design ou encore le bien-être. Roof top et terrasses sont plébiscitées et deviennent a minima du « nice to have », sans oublier l’agilité avec des espaces réversibles et/ou des espaces de coworking qui permettent d’envisager de mixer le bail classique et le flex. Enfin, l’impact RSE est déterminant, tout comme l’inclusivité et l’ouverture sur la ville ».Concernant les loyers, la société de conseil précise que « malgré le contexte de crise, les valeurs locatives en régions demeurent stables et ne fléchissent pas. On assiste, globalement, à une nouvelle hiérarchisation des valeurs locatives selon les qualités intrinsèques du bâtiment avec des mesures d’accompagnements qui sont en légère hausse pour atteindre parfois 15 % ». Et le directeur général adjoint de BNP Paribas Real Estate Transaction, en charge des régions, de conclure : « au-delà de ces chiffres très rassurants quant à la résilience de nos marchés, nous constatons que la demande exprimée auprès de BNP Paribas Real Estate au cours des trois premiers mois n’a baissé que de 13 % par rapport à l’an dernier, voire de seulement 2 % par rapport à la moyenne à cinq ans. Les mesures annoncées et la vaccination devraient accélérer la sortie de la crise et engendrer un rebond et un effet de rattrapage. Dans ce contexte, les perspectives d’évolution du marché des bureaux en régions sont de bon augure »…Ce qui ne peut, très certainement, que réjouir un peu plus les dirigeants d’Inéa, par exemple, qui parient sur les marchés régionaux depuis plus d’une vingtaine d’années maintenant ! En effet, cette foncière qui se présente elle-même comme « spécialiste des bureaux neufs dans les principales métropoles régionales » peut faire valoir de beaux résultats, y compris en cette période de crise sanitaire : un chiffre d’affaires consolidé pour le premier trimestre en hausse de 12,6 %, après 7,4 % au 1er trimestre 2020, ou encore un taux d’encaissement des loyers du premier trimestre qui s’élève à… 99 % ! Et Philippe Rosio, son président, de déclarer que « les résultats enregistrés en ce début d’année confortent le positionnement de la société. Le taux de recouvrement des loyers et l’activité locative soutenue reflètent à la fois la qualité des locataires et l’attractivité des immeubles de bureaux neufs dans les régions ». Tout en soulignant que « le développement des métropoles régionales a été considérable : nouvelles infrastructures, nette amélioration de l’accessibilité (lignes de tramway et LGV) et, aujourd’hui, le haut débit. En 20 ans, ces villes ont connu un véritable boom démographique (+16 % en moyenne, voire +25 % à Toulouse, Nantes, Rennes ou Montpellier) »… Et la crise sanitaire et ses conséquences laissent supposer que ce n’est pas fini…","['perspectives', 'que', 'bon', 'régions', 'des', 'le', 'et', 'la', 'les', 'sur', 'augure', 'qui', 'en', 'à']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

It has an ambitious agenda to challenge the status quo and deliver a superior experience to retail customers, large enterprises and MSMEs across West Africa.The group is expanding rapidly through a series of successive strategic acquisitions that include First International Bank (FIB) Group in Gambia, followed by BNP Paribas' Subsidiaries, La Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie de la Guinée (BICIGUI) in Guinea and La Banque Internationale pour le Commerce l'Industrie et l'Agriculture du Burkina (BICIAB) in Burkina Faso. Vista Bank is now the top bank in Guinea by assets and network coverage.In response to its digital-first strategy, Vista has selected Radar Payments by BPC as its preferred partner to drive digital payment adoption in the region. Radar Payments will centralise payment operations at Vista's tech hub located in Senegal, supervising Vista Bank's activities in Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone while leaving room for further banks to join its network. It is part of the bank's growth agenda to expand to Burkina-Faso, Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Mali.The agreement will see Vista Bank running on BPC's flagship payment suite, SmartVista to manage card issuance and lifecycle management, payment switching, ATM and Point-Of-Sales management as well as providing digital channels such as mobile banking and e-wallet; personalised to both retail and corporate clients. The bank is planning to accelerate the issuance of UnionPay International (UPI) branded cards including prepaid, debit, and premium cards, in addition to the acquisition in ATM, Point-of-Sales, Contactless, QR payment, and E-Commerce.This announcement comes at a time where AfCFTA, the pan-African free trade agreement has become a reality. Since 1st January 2021, AfCFTA has set new business standards for 41 countries and 1.2 billion people to help accelerate economic growth across the continent. The free trade programme promises a change in trading rules, with reduced import export taxes making commerce more affordable for players in Africa. It also means that the volume of transactions will sharply increase and banks in the continent will have to gear up for a pan-African service.Simon Tiemtore, Group Chairman at Vista Bank, said: ""With AfCFTA, banks have to think pan-Africa first, and realise that we need to step up the game in terms of ease of payment, a critical component to every banking and business experience. As a challenger bank, Vista Bank is taking bold decisions when it comes to its technology stack, forming alliances with the best partners in their own fields. By selecting Radar Payments, the paytech by BPC, we have chosen a leader with a solid reputation in delivering superior global payments processing.""Evgenia Loginova, CEO of Radar Payments, commented: ""We are proud to join Vista Bank on their journey to transform the way people bank, pay and get paid, while making financial services more accessible to them.

The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles. But despite the intense interest, the era of the new car is a hyper-competitive one in China, and tech giants have a lot to prove.“There’s a big element of faith in the tech companies’ bets,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director of consultancy AlixPartners in Shanghai and a former Ford Motor Co. executive. “This is a matter of creating something new that doesn’t exist now. That’s where the element of faith comes into play.”Huawei has been at the fore, recently announcing plans to invest $1 billion in EVs and its own self-driving technology, which it claims has “already surpassed” electric car pioneer Tesla Inc. in some aspects.The Shenzhen-based company, better known for its mobile-phone networks and being the subject of crippling U.S. sanctions, has unveiled its first car developed with BAIC BluePark Mew Energy Technology Co. The mid-sized Arcfox S sedan uses HI, or Huawei Inside, an intelligent automotive software package that enables it to run on autonomous driving mode in city areas for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) without human intervention. Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there. On top of that, for some there’s the opportunity to charge for tech add-ons and system improvements, essentially treating the vehicle like a piece of computer hardware that constantly gets its software updated.“They will definitely focus on being intelligent,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Autoforesight Co. “Making a good electrified car is a ‘pass,’ while making a good intelligent car will make an ‘A-grade.’ That’s what these tech giants are good at. Their main revenue will not be from selling the car but finding other ways to earn post-sale, such as over-the-air system upgrades or software subscriptions.”Big Tech in China Is Eyeing EVs for a Reason: Hyperdrive DailyFirst MoversBaidu -- which started investing in robo-taxi technology as early as 2013 and funded Chinese EV startup WM Motors -- now plans to spend $7.7 billion over the next five years developing smart-car technology via its newly established unit Jidu Auto. The division aims to launch its first model in three years, followed by new releases every 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Xia Yiping said.“The core value of cars in the future will be how intelligent they are,” Xia said, echoing a familiar refrain. “The earlier a company plans, the more control of self-developed technologies it gains, the more advanced technology it has, the more power it will own in the market.”Jidu has a core team of about 100 staff, and will expand to as many as 3,000 personnel by the end of next year, including up to 500 software engineers, he said. The first batch of cars will be based on Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s pure EV manufacturing structure, while Jidu will collaborate with Baidu’s autonomous-driving unit Apollo, with a special focus on smart cars and the mass production of autonomous driving features. The unit will embark on its next fundraising round soon, with further investment expected from Baidu and external investors.Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has also announced plans to invest about $10 billion over the next decade to manufacture electric cars, though hasn’t disclosed much detail or given a timeframe for deliveries. Billionaire co-founder Lei Jun in March announced his intention to lead a new standalone division and spearhead the drive into EVs, in what he called his final major startup endeavor.“We have deep pockets for this project,” Lei, who is also Xiaomi’s chief executive officer, said when unveiling the plan. “I’m fully aware of the risks of the car-making industry. I’m also aware the project will take at least three-to-five years with tens of billions of investment.”While China’s tech giants may be late to the game and entering unfamiliar territory, that could play to their advantage, said Dyer of AlixPartners.“This isn’t an industry where you have to be the first-mover to win,” he said. “In fact, in the auto industry, the first mover typically never wins. It’s always the follower who wins. Because when you are the first mover, you’re the one paying to learn through all the mistakes.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['c', 'know', 'car', 'china', 'cars', 'giants', 'intelligent', 'dips', 'thats', 'huawei', 'gains', 'technology', 'citigroup', 'tech', 'market', 'plans']",2021-05-05,,LCH SA

In addition, we recently received encouraging news on several key assets from our partners. The Biologics License Application (BLA) filing of efgartigimod in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Phase 3 pivotal LUNAR trial of Tumor Treating Fields in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was recommended to continue with reduced sample size based on an accelerated interim analysis. Bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA as first-line treatment for gastric cancer patients who overexpress FGFR2b. “With the completion of our recent global public offering with gross proceeds of nearly $860 million, we significantly strengthened our capital position. This new capital will allow us to accelerate our growth by entering into additional strategic partnerships, advancing our clinical development pipeline, and scaling our commercial and R&D organizations to drive strong revenue growth and enhance our global pipeline. “We remain on target to advance all stages of our product pipeline throughout 2021. We continue to expect approval of Nuzyra for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) by the NMPA. We plan to file margetuximab for Her2-positive breast cancer, Tumor Treating Fields for mesothelioma and ZEJULA for late-line ovarian cancer in China.

Your city needs you.”“The truth is that New York City cannot afford to defund the police,” he added.Times Square represents the commercial and tourist heart of Manhattan, itself the financial capital of New York City and the nation. The shooting comes as the city is revving up its marketing engine, with the goal of reviving New York City’s tourist trade.In the year before the pandemic, 66.6 million tourists came to town, giving rise to 400,000 tourism-related jobs and an estimated economic impact of $70 billion. Last year, only 22 million tourists came to New York City, and officials estimate it will take years for the industry to recover.The police say more than 460 people have been shot this year in New York City as of May 2, compared with 259 last year and 239 in 2019 at the same point. Mr. de Blasio routinely attributes the rise in shootings to the societal upheaval wrought by the pandemic, which has created mass unemployment, and also blames a slowdown in the court system. Dermot F. Shea, Mr. de Blasio’s police commissioner, tends to blame recent statewide criminal justice reforms, which he says have made it harder to keep those charged with criminal offenses in jail.Understand the N.Y.C. Mayoral Race Who’s Running for Mayor? There are more than a dozen people still in the race to become New York City’s next mayor, and the primary will be held on June 22. Here’s a rundown of the candidates. What is Ranked-Choice Voting? New York City began using ranked-choice voting for primary elections this year, and voters will be able to list up to five candidates in order of preference. Confused? We can help.Both Mr. Adams and Mr. Yang took the opportunity to highlight their policing agendas, which include reimagining plainclothes anti-violence units. Mr. de Blasio disbanded his plainclothes anti-crime unit, which had been involved in many police shootings, last year. Both also touted their commitment to criminal justice reform.Mr. Yang said he would ensure his plainclothes unit was populated by better-trained officers with clean records. Mr. Adams has said he would hire officers for the unit with the skills and temperament for the job.Other moderate candidates, like the former sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia and the former Citigroup executive Raymond J. McGuire, chimed in with similar themes — that public safety and strong policing need not come at the expense of criminal justice reform.","['yang', 'unit', 'safety', 'criminal', 'adams', 'nypd', 'plainclothes', 'shooting', 'public', 'mr', 'justice', 'york', 'support', 'times', 'city', 'stress', 'square']",2021-05-09,,LCH SA

""That was very localized pain, and it really surprised a lot of people.""Energy traders with three Texas electric cooperatives told Reuters they paid as much as $400 per mmBtu during a four-day stretch that began Valentine's Day weekend. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the crisis. San Antonio's municipal utility CPS Energy said its gas bill for the week was about $700 million.""I've been tracking natural gas markets for 20 years. I've never seen price increases like we saw,"" said Tyson Slocum, an energy and environmental advisory committee member at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization.WINNING AND LOSINGAustralia’s Macquarie, the second-largest marketer of U.S. natural gas, said its trading around the storm boosted its overall profit outlook for the year by about 10%, which analysts estimated at about A$400 million ($317 million).Ahead of the storm, Macquarie traders researched how previous cold fronts disrupted infrastructure to prepare a plan, said sources within the firm, who requested anonymity. The company did not comment for this story.Texas's grid operator ERCOT canceled $1 billion in service charges and state officials are considering securitizing unpaid ERCOT bills from electric companies that defaulted.Many of the firms that profited from trading, such as Goldman Sachs and BofA, are also facing losses from their exposure to utilities and electric co-operatives that have declared bankruptcy, according to court filings.BofA made hundreds of millions via its trading arm, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, but it is owed nearly $480 million by Brazos Electric Power Cooperative, which filed for bankruptcy.Disputes over price gouging and reneged contracts have also emerged after some suppliers declared the freeze was a force majeure event that allowed them to suspend contracts.Macquarie was sued by Exxon seeking to void an $11 million gas bill. CPS Energy sued BP, Chevron, Energy Transfer and others for submitting bills that ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Texas wind farm operators also have filed lawsuits against trading arms of JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, maintaining the cold snap was an extreme event that overrode contracts for power generation and delivery.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","['profits', 'gas', 'billions', 'trading', 'delivers', 'texas', 'natural', 'market', 'storm', 'sellers', 'million', 'power', 'freeze', 'companies', 'energy', 'prices']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriU.S. employers likely hired nearly a million workers in April as they rushed to meet a surge in demand, unleashed by the reopening of the economy amid rapidly improving public health and massive financial help from the government.The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will be the first to show the impact of the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package, which was approved in March. It is likely to show the economy entered the second quarter with even greater momentum, firmly putting it on track this year for its best performance in almost four decades.""We are looking for a pretty good figure, reflecting the ongoing reopening we have seen,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""With cash in people's pockets, economic activity is looking good and that should lead to more and more hiring right across the economy.""According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 978,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. That would leave employment about 7.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.Twelve months ago, the economy purged a record 20.679 million jobs as it reeled from mandatory closures of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.April's payrolls estimates range from as low as 656,000 to as high as 2.1 million jobs. New claims for unemployment benefits have dropped below 500,000 for the first-time since the pandemic started and job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers in April were the lowest in nearly 21 years.Also arguing for another month of blockbuster job growth, consumers' perceptions of the labor market are the strongest in 13 months. But the pent-up demand, which contributed to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace in the first quarter, the second-fastest since the third quarter of 2003, has triggered shortages of labor and raw materials.From manufacturing to restaurants, employers are scrambling for workers. A range of factors, including parents still at home caring for children, coronavirus-related retirements and generous unemployment checks, are blamed for the labor shortages.""While we do not expect that lack of workers will weigh noticeably on April employment, rehiring could become more difficult in coming months before expanded unemployment benefits expire in September,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.Payroll gains were likely led by the leisure and hospitality industry as more high-contact businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement parks reopen. Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, leading states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to lift most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses.BROAD EMPLOYMENT GAINSSolid gains were also expected in manufacturing, despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has forced motor vehicle manufacturers to cut production. Strong housing demand likely boosted construction payrolls.Government employment is also expected to have picked up as school districts hired more teachers following the resumption of in-person learning in many states.Robust hiring is unlikely to have an impact on President Joe Biden's plan to spend another $4 trillion on education and childcare, middle- and low-income families, infrastructure and jobs. Neither was it expected to influence monetary policy, with the Federal Reserve having signaled it is prepared to let the economy run hotter than it did in previous cycles.Millions of Americans remain out of work and many have permanently lost jobs because of the pandemic.""Nobody knows what the economy is going to look like post COVID,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""There is a stubbornly high number of people who have been permanently displaced. The (spending) plans are about giving the economy a higher trajectory of growth so that these people can be hired sooner rather than later.""The unemployment rate is forecast dropping to 5.8% in April from 6.0% in March. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work.""To gauge the recovery, economists will focus on the number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months as well as those out of work because of permanent job losses.The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, likely improved last month, though it remained below its pre-pandemic level. More than 4 million people, many of them women, dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic.With the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry expected to dominate employment gains, average hourly earnings were likely unchanged in April after dipping 0.1% in March. That would lead to a 0.4% drop in wages on a year-on-year basis after a 4.2% increase in March.""We will be watching average hourly earnings very closely for signs that difficulty in hiring qualified workers is beginning to boost compensation,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York.""If tightening labor markets boost wage growth, then the inflation bounce which the Fed is anticipating to be modest and transitory could turn out to be stronger and longer-lasting, leading to earlier Fed tightening.""The anticipated drop in wages will have no impact on consumer spending, with Americans sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings.

Citigroup,2,PyNews API,https://www.businessinsider.com/esg-deals-surge-changing-investment-banks-advise-clients-dealmaking-rbc-2021-5,RBC dealmakers explain how investment banking is transforming as ESG becomes a hot topic with clients,"Here's what the wave of ESG dealmaking means for investment banks, according to two top RBC dealmakers.A wave of ESG-focused initiatives and dealmaking is sweeping the capital markets.Also in 2020, RBC Capital Markets exclusively advised the energy firm Total in its 51% stake purchase of the Seagreen 1 offshore wind farm project.​Patrick said that one way RBC Capital Markets aims to help fix that problem is by helping clients craft their sustainability reports.RBC Capital Markets has launched ESG-focused programming of its own, such as the PRIDE employee resource group, which stands for Proud RBC Individuals for Diversity and Equality.","Corporates are stepping up their demands for sustainably-focused deals, and banks are responding.The first quarter of 2021 saw more than $58 billion worth of sustainable M&A, Refinitiv found.Here's what the wave of ESG dealmaking means for investment banks, according to two top RBC dealmakers.See more stories on Insider's business page.A wave of ESG-focused initiatives and dealmaking is sweeping the capital markets. And investment banks, recognizing that it's having an impact on the kind of advice they provide to corporate clients, are adjusting accordingly.A decade ago, sizing up a deal based on its ESG values would have been seen as ""more confirmatory in nature, versus necessarily being more at the forefront of the evaluation of what we're considering in determining valuation and the viability of a transaction target,"" Vito Sperduto, RBC Capital Markets' co-head of global mergers-and-acquisitions, told Insider.But now, those three factors — environmental, social, and corporate governance — can prove key to deals.""Today, any of those key areas could cause a transaction not to happen,"" said Sperduto, who leads a team of more than 100 RBC M&A bankers in the US and abroad.Bankers have no choice but to consider ESG when advising on deals, as it's increasingly becoming a significant part of the market.There were 224 M&A deals in the first quarter of 2021 considered ""sustainable"" by data provider Refinitiv in its recent finance review report. That's a 29% year-over-year increase, resulting in some $58.6 billion in deal volumes for the quarter.And it's not just M&A seeing the sustainable financing boom. In the debt capital markets, sustainable bond issuance reached an all-time high in the first quarter of 2021: $286.5 billion, Refinitiv found. That represents more than double the first quarter of 2020, and a 48% increase from the fourth quarter of 2020.The Biden administration, too, has moved ESG imperatives to the forefront. President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit with more than three dozen world leaders and pledged that the US will slash greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by the year 2030.""Shareholders are engaged, business management teams are engaged, governments are engaged, and employees are really finding that they have a voice in these issues too,"" said Lindsay Patrick, a managing director and head of strategic initiatives and ESG at RBC Capital Markets.ESG is incentivizing bankers to reach across divisions within their firmsRBC Capital Markets has advised on numerous deals which were considered sustainable.One example is the work the firm did in 2020 as the exclusive advisor to General Motors in its partnership with EVgo to build more than 2,700 new fast chargers for electric vehicles over the next five years.Also in 2020, RBC Capital Markets exclusively advised the energy firm Total in its 51% stake purchase of the Seagreen 1 offshore wind farm project.One upshot of ESG's rise to relevance has meant bankers need to be willing to work across teams. Collaboration has become a key consideration for every M&A banker, Patrick said.""Your consumer products company might be interested in procuring renewable energy, so you're going to need to be able to go to your renewable energy team in order to be able to solve that and come up with the best advice for your clients,"" said Patrick.Investment banks — often bifurcated into ""product"" groups which handle services like M&A advisory or IPOs for their clients, and ""coverage"" groups in which bankers focus on specific industries, like technology or industrials — are seeing corporate interest for ESG services transcend both teams.That means bankers, whether they conventionally tackle healthcare deals or media transactions or anything in between, need to have an awareness of these values and why they're top of mind for corporate and institutional clients.""These factors in our view are a three-legged stool,"" Patrick said. ""They need to be balanced on a three-legged stool, and not have one factor outweigh the others.""Sustainability reports are proving keyHowever, the rise of support for ESG hasn't come without some drawbacks. ESG has drawn criticism for the nebulousness and breadth of the term, which is massive in scope and historically has struggled with a lack of strong, widely-available data available to measure progress toward companies' targets or public statements. ​Patrick said that one way RBC Capital Markets aims to help fix that problem is by helping clients craft their sustainability reports. These reports, which are separate from financial statements, enable companies to disclose information on ESG metrics pertaining to subjects like emissions, diversity efforts, or health and safety.""We know what a good sustainability report and good sustainability disclosures look like,"" she said, ""versus ones which I would say might be more high-level in nature.""These reports also prove key during the due diligence process, when companies assess merger or acquisition targets.Warning signs are becoming clear earlier as to whether a deal could bode badly from a sustainability perspective, Sperduto said. And they also hold more weight.Now, rather than just being a knock on a target's valuation, finding during the diligence process that an M&A target is doing something problematic to the environment could jettison a deal altogether.""Historically, if you found something from an environmental perspective at a target, it was the one ESG area that caused a clear hit from a valuation perspective, versus an expanded scope today,"" he said.How banks are trying to affect positive change and model ESG-conscious behaviorIn addition to providing a range of ESG-focused advisory services to clients, banks are recognizing their role in modeling good behavior internally that their clients may seek to emulate within their workplaces.RBC Capital Markets has launched ESG-focused programming of its own, such as the PRIDE employee resource group, which stands for Proud RBC Individuals for Diversity and Equality.PRIDE, which was formed in 1999, counts more than 600 members at RBC in the US. Sperduto is a sponsor of the group, which offers support for LGBTQ+ and allied employees.Efforts like PRIDE have caught the attention of clients who are eager to learn more about how they can apply lessons to their own operations, Sperduto said.During a client meeting with a private-equity company that RBC represents, Sperduto was asked to explain what the firm is doing in relation to diversity and inclusion.In another case, he said, two clients approached him last summer during a period of nationwide unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd to understand more about how RBC was approaching the subject with its workforce and see what it could apply to its own team.Other banks are also taking steps of their own.Both Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gases and financed emissions targets by the year 2050.Goldman Sachs has vowed not to take companies public unless they have two women or diverse individuals on their corporate boards.""The most powerful way to talk about these topics is to talk about it from our experience ourselves, and how we've imparted those throughout our firm and our employees,"" Sperduto said.Patrick agreed. ""These are human issues at the end of the day,"" she said. ""It's the human element of banking.""","['capital', 'markets', 'hot', 'explain', 'transforming', 'topic', 'rbc', 'ma', 'deals', 'investment', 'banks', 'sperduto', 'clients', 'esg', 'banking', 'quarter', 'dealmakers']",2021-05-08,,LCH SA

Some are doing better than others.Just one in three return-to-work decision makers say their company is poised to negotiate a successful return to the workplace, according to a new survey conducted as the U.S. mass-vaccination effort forges ahead.The independent media organization Reset Work polled 55 human-resources leaders and “return-to-workplace decision makers” in industries including internet and technology, financial services, retail and e-commerce, consumer products, nonprofit, and professional services.“Other surveys have revealed what employees are thinking aboutreturning to offices; for this survey, we wanted to focus on the actual decision makers, and we learned that returning to work is likely to be unpredictable and potentially chaotic,” the report said.“ Hybrid arrangements that mix in-office and remote work are the clear frontrunner so far. ”Among the findings: Some 27% of companies haven’t yet committed to a specific arrangement, but hybrid arrangements that mix in-office and remote work are the clear frontrunner so far (63%).

Citigroup Inc.’s inflation-surprise index for emerging markets spiked last month to the highest since 2008, a sign investors may be underestimating the scale of the resurgence.Long the scourge of debt holders and a threat to currency stability, accelerating inflation has already spurred policy makers in Brazil and Russia to raise borrowing costs. The Czech central bank last week signaled it may follow suit in mid-year, while Turkey’s monetary authority has pledged to keep interest rates elevated until there is a significant slowdown in price gains.“Inflation has reared its head as a key market narrative once again,” said Emily Weis, a Boston-based macro strategist at State Street Global Markets. “This is partly driven by concerns around extreme monetary accommodation, fiscal largess and their combined impact on the green shoots of recovery.”Listen to the EM Weekly Podcast: Virus Resurgence Concern Weighs on AssetsThe prospect of tighter monetary conditions in emerging markets hasn’t changed the calculus for many investors, with behemoths including Pacific Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc. focusing on growth instead.

The Fed appears in no rush to raise rates, a move that would siphon capital out of emerging economies currently enjoying the windfall from U.S. stimulus.The fact that major central banks currently view inflation as transitory should boost developing-nation currencies as a whole, according to Henrik Gullberg, a London-based macro strategist at Coex Partners Ltd.However sticky the inflation outlook, some banks were placing wagers on different responses to it. Citi strategists suggested investors buy the Czech koruna against the Hungarian forint with policy makers in Prague likely raising rates in the coming months while Budapest looks past the price spike for now.MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market currency index climbed to a record on Friday, while the related equity gauge posted its biggest two-day gain in almost two weeks. Risk assets are getting further support after U.S. job growth data significantly undershot forecasts.“On the one hand, the valuations of growth stocks look meaningfully less demanding after recent underperformance coupled with earnings upgrades,” said Kate Moore, head of thematic strategy at BlackRock in New York. “On the other, rising inflationary pressures from the broad economic restart and low inventories should be supportive of cyclicals and commodity producers.”Inflation:Data on Tuesday is forecast to show China’s inflation accelerated to 1% in April from 0.4% a month prior, according to a Bloomberg surveyThe offshore yuan climbed to its strongest since February last weekIn Brazil, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey shows inflation probably accelerated to 6.74% in AprilIndia’s consumer prices probably rose 4.1% from a year earlier in April, slowing from 5.52% the previous monthThe slowdown is likely to be transitory as base effects turn unfavorable in May, Citigroup Inc. economists led by Johanna Chua wrote in a reportThe rupee is the worst performer in Asia this quarter as the country battles its biggest wave of Covid-19 infectionsArgentina and Israel will also release inflation figuresOther Events:Turkey’s lira may face renewed pressure should current-account data on Tuesday show the deficit is widening.

Citigroup,2,Bing API,https://www.americanbanker.com/news/activist-investors-vow-to-keep-pressing-for-racial-audits-at-big-banks,Activist investors vow to keep pressing for racial audits at big banks,"Large banks have been busy this proxy season repelling efforts by activist shareholders to require outside examinations of whether their businesses are contributing to racial inequality.While the majority of shareholders at Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs voted against requiring racial equity audits, a sizable minority backed the idea.Not counting those who abstained from voting, more than 38% of Citigroup shareholders supported the racial equity audits, followed by 31.1% at Goldman and 26.5% at Bank of America.But those supporting the racial equity proposals were allowed to make their pitch.New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees state pension funds and supports the racial equity audit proposals, said in a statement that it’s important for the large banks in which the pension funds invest to address racial equity issues.","Large banks have been busy this proxy season repelling efforts by activist shareholders to require outside examinations of whether their businesses are contributing to racial inequality.But as the votes have been tallied at annual meetings, supporters of these proposals have been encouraged by the results. While the majority of shareholders at Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs voted against requiring racial equity audits, a sizable minority backed the idea.“We are happy with the result,” said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, a shareholder that formally proposed the idea at several companies, including BofA. “We think the boards need to pay attention to these results.”The audits would formally examine bank lending practices, branch locations and other business decisions for signs of “adverse impacts” on people of color. The proposals have also included a measurement of diversity within the companies’ ranks and an assessment of whether massive philanthropic investments announced in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody and the civil unrest that unfolded last year address the economic issues the banks are targeting with the money.Not counting those who abstained from voting, more than 38% of Citigroup shareholders supported the racial equity audits, followed by 31.1% at Goldman and 26.5% at Bank of America. Wells Fargo faced the fewest votes in favor of the proposal at about 13%. The San Francisco bank’s executives have said they are in the middle of a human rights impact audit that involves a third party and would cover much of the same ground.“The difference is our focus on racial equity is part of a broader assessment that also includes other aspects of human rights,” Wells Fargo Chairman Charles Noski said April 27 at the annual meeting.Banking leaders were spared some of the typical fiery questions from shareholders during the meetings that were once again held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But those supporting the racial equity proposals were allowed to make their pitch.During the Citi meeting on April 27, Tejal Patel, corporate governance director at CtW Investment Group, pointed to recent examples of racial inequality. She said that large banks prioritized existing clients in the early days of the Paycheck Protection Program and questioned how Citi’s $1 billion commitment to close racial wealth gaps, announced last September, would be monitored.“Given such a significant sum, investors need assurances that the bank’s policies are effective at addressing this issue and that Citi is not acting in other ways that negate any positive impact,” Patel said.Citi’s new CEO Jane Fraser addressed the concerns during the meeting even though the bank urged shareholders to reject the proposal as “not necessary.”“Given Citi’s commitment to addressing racial disparities, social justice and the racial wealth gap … I would say that Citi is already addressing this proposal, although we fully recognize that there is a lot more work to do, and we’re committed to continue doing so,” Fraser said.Several of the proposals cleared upcoming requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission that they meet certain thresholds before they can be resubmitted. The highest bar is that a shareholder measure must get 25% of the vote, excluding abstentions and broker non-votes on its third attempt. Many racial wealth audit proposals passed this mark in their first year in a signal about how they may fare under the rules that go into effect next year.The largest bank in the U.S. by assets, JPMorgan Chase, is scheduled to hold a highly anticipated vote on the proposal during its annual meeting on May 18.The proposals have been supported by major public investment groups like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the New York City Pension Funds, according to Waizenegger.“We anticipate this sentiment will only become more urgent in the coming years, as Bank of America and other institutions face blowback for the adverse impacts of their practices and policies on communities of color,” Waizenegger said.Bank of America urged shareholders not to support the measure in its proxy materials and pointed to ongoing efforts to report the bank’s impact on issues surrounding race.“We believe our actions and focus in making progress on the issue of racial equality, and reporting on our progress regularly, render the proposal’s requested audit unnecessary,” the bank said in its proxy statement.New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees state pension funds and supports the racial equity audit proposals, said in a statement that it’s important for the large banks in which the pension funds invest to address racial equity issues.“The results so far are encouraging, particularly for a new proposal, and show that a significant percentage of investors recognize the risks that failure to address racial injustice presents to their long-term value,” DiNapoli said. “All investors should be asking their portfolio companies if their policies, practices, and products are fair and nondiscriminatory.”","['racial', 'pressing', 'equity', 'shareholders', 'proposal', 'audits', 'proposals', 'america', 'activist', 'wells', 'bank', 'banks', 'vow', 'audit', 'investors', 'big']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

Home boiler repairs and installations were 11% lower than the same time last year because non-essential home service visits were postponed to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.The slump in home energy services was also due to a long-running series of strikes by thousands of its engineers in response to the company’s plan to toughen its employment contracts in an effort to boost productivity and become more competitive.Under the fire and rehire plans most of Centrica’s 20,000 staff were told to accept the new conditions, which would increase working hours for its engineers, or lose their jobs.The company confirmed that 460 engineers were dismissed last month, as a result of what the GMB trade union has called “a dirty, bullying tactic”. A survey by the union found that more than three-quarters of the public believe that fire and rehire schemes should be made illegal.Chris O’Shea, who became Centrica chief executive last year, said his plans to modernise the company remained on track and “the difficult, but necessary process to move colleagues on to new terms and conditions is now complete”.“We are pleased that 98% of UK colleagues have accepted the new contracts which will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers. Although the external environment remains uncertain, our tight focus on cash and on fixing the basics across the group leaves us well placed as we continue the turnaround of our company,” O’Shea said.O’Shea hopes to save £100m in operational costs this year as part of a plan to stem the steady decline of the FTSE 250 energy company in recent years. British Gas has lost about 3 million household energy customers in the last decade following an influx of successful new energy startups.

In addition, we recently received encouraging news on several key assets from our partners. The Biologics License Application (BLA) filing of efgartigimod in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Phase 3 pivotal LUNAR trial of Tumor Treating Fields in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was recommended to continue with reduced sample size based on an accelerated interim analysis. Bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA as first-line treatment for gastric cancer patients who overexpress FGFR2b. “With the completion of our recent global public offering with gross proceeds of nearly $860 million, we significantly strengthened our capital position. This new capital will allow us to accelerate our growth by entering into additional strategic partnerships, advancing our clinical development pipeline, and scaling our commercial and R&D organizations to drive strong revenue growth and enhance our global pipeline. “We remain on target to advance all stages of our product pipeline throughout 2021. We continue to expect approval of Nuzyra for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) by the NMPA. We plan to file margetuximab for Her2-positive breast cancer, Tumor Treating Fields for mesothelioma and ZEJULA for late-line ovarian cancer in China. We are engaging with the NMPA on the regulatory filing strategy for efgartigimod in gMG in China. And we anticipate numerous data readouts, including for Tumor Treating Fields in liver cancer and ovarian cancer, for QINLOCK in second-line GIST, for margetuximab in gastric cancer, for CLN-081 in NSCLC and for TPX-0022 in NSCLC and gastric cancer. “In our mission to address serious unmet medical needs for patients in China and around the world, we believe that we have built a sustainable platform that we can leverage,” Dr. Du concluded. “Our team continues to deliver on our aggressive growth objectives.

First-Quarter 2021 Financial Results For the three months ended March 31, 2021, net product revenues were $20.1 million, compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2020. Revenues for the period were comprised of $12.6 million for ZEJULA, compared to $6.3 million for the same period in 2020; and $7.1 million for Optune, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2020.Research and Development (R&D) expenses were $203.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $33.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to a $62.3 million upfront payment in Zai Lab equity (fair value of the shares on the closing date of the agreement due to certain restrictions) and a $75 million development cost-sharing payment to argenx; a $25 million upfront payment to Turning Point; expenses related to ongoing and newly initiated late-stage clinical trials; and payroll and payroll-related expenses from increased R&D headcount.Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A) were $35.8 million for three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $18.7 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to payroll and payroll-related expenses from increased commercial headcount and related costs, as Zai Lab continued to expand its commercial operations in China.For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Zai Lab reported a net loss of $232.9 million, or a loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.64, compared to a net loss of $48.0 million, or a loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.66, for the same period in 2020. The increase in the net loss was primarily attributable to payments related to new business development activities with argenx and Turning Point recorded in R&D expenses.

But is it enough?The pandemic has created an entirely new set of rules for the workplace, and while the new environment created flexibility, it also eliminated the boundaries between work and life for some.With no clear line between being at your desk and being on your couch, along with the outside personal stress and isolation of the pandemic, employees are experiencing burnout more than ever before.According to Deloitte, more than three-quarters (77%) of employees have experienced burnout at their current job, and more than half have experienced it more than once.To combat burnout, employers are testing new solutions. For example, LinkedIn provided its 15,900 full-time employees one week of PTO at the beginning of April to combat severe burnout and help mitigate the mental health difficulties stemming from the pandemic. Citigroup also announced it was eliminating Zoom meetings on Friday and adding a mental health holiday on May 28.Combating burnout the right wayWhile these are nice gestures for employees, having one day free of meetings or a few extra days off is not the permanent solution employees need to break the burnout cycle, and rather puts a band-aid on the situation.Dr. Natalie Baumgartner, Chief Workforce Scientist at Achievers Workforce Institute, is someone I've been tracking for her expertise. She's not surprised that we're seeing employees experience burnout as a result of the pandemic but agrees employers can do more. She shared with me, ""Organizations want to help reduce the impact of burnout, and are taking some good first steps such as reducing meetings and offering additional time off,"" said Baumgartner. ""However, preventing burnout requires ongoing support and policies, not one-off efforts that may delay but not negate burnout.""So what should employers do to ensure they are addressing the root cause of burnout for the long-term rather than alleviating it for a brief period of time? Baumgartner walks us through three tactics companies should consider.1. Reevaluate resources to ensure reasonable workloadsInsufficient resources on teams is a common complaint among employees that can contribute to burnout, as employees struggle to complete their required tasks without the necessary support.""Burnout can mean increased absenteeism, reduced productivity, and lower employee participation,"" said Baumgartner. ""While it may seem difficult to hire more team members to support or change team structures, ultimately, if there is not a permanent change it highly increases the chance of an employee leaving the organization.""Since more than half of employees plan to look for a new job in 2021, and better work-life balance is the top reason 25% of employees would switch, it's important managers monitor their direct reports' workloads and have frequent conversations to ensure individuals are not overloaded and having to work evenings and weekends.Listening to employees' needs through these one-to-one chats, and through larger organizational surveys, will help leaders understand what employees truly need to take actions that stop burnout in its tracks.2. Encourage PTO and consistent offline hoursDowntime on a regular basis is crucial for managing burnout. This is where LinkedIn and Citigroup have made the right moves. However, a day or even a week of vacation is insufficient in curbing burnout in the long term. Employees need downtime on a daily basis in addition to a regular cadence of vacation time.""Companies often see challenges with employees' willingness to take time off when the problem starts from the top,"" said Baumgartner. ""If senior leaders and managers are not taking vacation and signing off at a reasonable time each day, employees won't feel empowered to do the same for themselves.""3. Support physical well-being, exercise, and mindfulnessWhile many of us have been stuck inside for the winter months, exercise has become a lower priority for many employees, trying to balance late nights and early mornings with their own personal responsibilities. But research has shown exercise is important for preventing burnout. There are plenty of ways to get this exercise -- from a daily walk to an online yoga class -- but when people feel busy and overwhelmed it is often one of the first things to go.""In addition to daily exercise, mindfulness is a key way to help individuals build resilience,"" said Baumgartner. ""Organizations can hold mindful meditation sessions and provide subscriptions to meditation apps to help employees build their mindful practice.""As employers look to attract and retain talent for the year ahead, creating long term solutions to prevent burnout will be key.","['employees', 'pandemic', 'baumgartner', 'instead', 'vacation', 'employers', 'wrong', 'solutions', 'exercise', 'addressing', 'support', 'help', 'companies', 'getting', 'burnout']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

Nomura,3,Google API,https://www.ijf.org/news/show/nomura-i-want-to-learn-more,Nomura: I Want to Learn More,"Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world.Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura.Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion.So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’.When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension.","Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world. The reason is simple: he is the only judoka to have won three Olympic gold medals (Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004), all in the -60kg weight division, to which a gold medal at the 1997 World Championships in Paris must also be added, among so many other achievements. Behind the medals and the public face, there is also a man who has a lot to say. As the Tokyo Olympic Games are fast approaching, we asked him to comment on his illustrious career and to tell us something of his own judo philosophy.We all know how difficult it is to win an Olympic title. It requires years of preparation and dedication. When one athlete wins the Olympic grail, this is already a fantastic achievement, that often concludes a brilliant career. This, when the same athlete steps up for the second time to the top of the podium, is extraordinary, but when it happens for the third time and a row, there are no words to describe what it really represents.Keeping the motivation throughout such a long period of time is an aspect of Nomura's career that is the most incredible, “I started judo at a young age, when I was just three years old and I grew up within a judo family. As a child I was not strong, but when I arrived at my first Olympic Games, in Atlanta, I was 21, almost 22 and I was full of energy. My first Olympic gold changed my life and especially in judo, because once I became Olympic champion, everybody started to look at me and to study me. I had to work harder to remain on top and that was my first definable motivation.The whole process to go to the Olympic Games is very long and tiring. It is so difficult, but that motivated me. When I became Olympic champion for the second time, in Sydney, I felt that I had achieved something, but I was getting older and I needed a break in my career. I stopped for two years. I didn't know if I could make it again, so I started to travel and I went to San Francisco. There I was not a professional athlete anymore. I was free from the pressure and I learned a lot during those two years, especially when working with children. Actually that's what gave me the motivation to go for another term. After this break, I was missing the pressure of high level competition and was gaining energy from the young people I was working with. I found the extra motivation to start again with the whole preparation process.""Throughout the discussion with Tadahiro Nomura, it became clear that the youth had been the guideline that allowed him to succeed and that today he wants to dedicate even more time to the educational dimension of judo. Before digging into that subject more, we wanted to know if there was a secret to such longevity. When asked, Nomura-San started to answer by mentioning another champion, one who might be able to join him soon with three Olympic titles, “Teddy has already earned two Olympic titles, so if he wins this summer in Tokyo, he will have three Olympic golds as well, but he already has ten world titles, which is absolutely incredible. One half of me wants him to win because that would be fantastic for judo, but the other half wants Japan to win! What I want to tell him is that he needs to put all he has on the mat, with no regrets. Becoming Olympic Champion is not easy. One needs to cultivate a passion for judo and learn to love it. This is my secret. Throughout my life I've learned to love judo. Of course, there is a technical dimension. I've developed my capacity to throw with my special technique, seoi-nage, but beyond that, there is my love for the whole sport. As a Japanese judoka, I believe that it is very important to foster courteousness to the opponent and what I call the 'rei', which is based on respect and mutual prosperity.""A champion is the one who steps on top of the medal podium and who gets all the attention, but behind every man and woman who wins there are many contributors. One of Nomura's main architects was Shinji Hosokawa, Olympic and world champion. ""I met Hosokawa-Sensei at the University in Tenri and he changed my judo career forever. He would always tell me that it is not enough to train hard, but you need to train to win and for that you need to be clever and consistent. The secret is quality. Everyday when I was training I was thinking about the Olympic Games and I was imagining how it would be to lose, so I was prepared. Hosokawa-Sensei was always beside me. He helped me to enjoy judo training, to have fun, but at the same time to feel the pressure and the risk of losing. When I arrived in Atlanta and he was sitting in the coaches’ chair, I felt good and ready. I admire him because throughout his life he has continued improving and learning. He speaks English and French and he travelled a lot. He became a great champion before becoming a great coach and he is a great man as well, on and off the tatami. He's an example.""Today Tadahiro Nomura is never far away from judo. Being a well known TV announcer in Japan, he is also a public speaker who is keen to share his experience to help young people and athletes to reach their dreams. With the Tokyo Olympics just over the horizon, he is also in charge of two young judoka, who we all know very well, “I've been working with the Abe siblings for a while already. Abe Uta and Abe Hifumi are two great athletes. Normally in Japan, you become really famous once you have won the Olympic titles, which is not their case yet, but they are already well known in the country. They are exposed and I am there to help them and to guide them so they can benefit from the best training conditions as well as the best media presence. Beside my TV occupation and the Abes, I also organise judo clinics in and out of Japan, although with the global pandemic it is not possible to travel for the moment. Since I retired, I spend most of my time in a suit and tie. I miss the judogi, so whenever it's possible I like to go back on the tatami. Every time I have the chance to travel and participate in a judo clinic, I am happy. I feel that people respect me for my achievements, but I mostly feel the passion that judoka around the world have for our sport.""To understand a little bit more about the secret of the great champion, we need to understand better where he is coming from and what, at one point, made him reach the summit. ""As I said, I started judo at a very young age. My whole family was involved in judo. My grandfather founded a small family dojo named Houtokukan Nomura Dojo. My father was a successful high school judo coach. Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura. I can say that it was part of our daily life and when I started practising, the spirit of my grandfather inhabited our dojo. I don't remember having seen him on the tatami, but I remember his smile, always a happy face. You know, the key was the fun. In the Nomura dojo we had fun! Personally speaking, I had fun, even if I was crying a lot too, because I was not so strong and I was losing a lot. I didn't like that. When I entered middle school I was only 32kg and nobody believed I would be a good judoka, even if I wanted to be the best. When I was 12 or 13 I wanted to be a hero of the sport, but that was far beyond my reach. So I decided to take it step by step. When I turned 17 and I watched the Barcelona Olympic Games, I wanted to be there, but I had the feeling that those athletes on TV were on another planet. Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion. I realised that maybe I had a chance. When I was young I was losing a lot, mainly because I was competing against heavier judoka, but throughout all those loses, I've learned a lot. That was when I started to improve my technique, because I needed to find solutions.""Discovering the solutions to become better, through failures and defeats, is an important factor in Nomura's future success and this is exactly what he wants to transmit to the next generation of judoka, ""I would love now to have my own dojo where I could teach young children the secret to becoming a true judoka. But then the global pandemic started and I had to adapt. So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’. So, for the time being, I organise some judo classes online, on YouTube. It's a nice way to interact with the judo community. For the moment I do it in Japan, but I'd be happy to share it beyond Japan. I am really looking forward to being back with children on the tatami again."" When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension. ""Some years ago, I travelled to France, with Uemura-Sensei and the Kodokan. I had the feeling that I knew a lot about the sport side of judo, but there I started to understand a little better what jita kyoei meant. Ok, so judo is an element of budo, with one person facing another and one of them winning, but judo is much more than that. It is a form of education. Judo carries real values that are all embedded in the bow, the rei. I want to keep learning more about that and I want to communicate more as well. This is what makes judo different from any other activity. This is what Jigoro Kano gave us. When you are an athlete it is not easy to think about education. When I was a child I wanted to win. Parents and teachers want their children to win, but before that we should teach them to love judo for what it is: a beautiful educational tool and a fun activity. After my career, I realised that for me it was not always fun to be on the tatami and to train hard. It was difficult, but every time it was really hard, I would remember the fun I had when I was a child and then suddenly everything would become easier. I started to process all I've learned, but I still have a lot to discover and this is what I want to do now.I admire all the projects that the IJF does, like Judo for Children and Judo for Peace. These are fantastic ideas because they bring to the masses a dimension of judo invented by Jigoro Kano Shihan himself. All these programmes offer possibilities for everyone to shine through judo and find their own answers to the challenges that we have to face. I know the power of judo and I'm really identifying myself within that. Over the past years, the number of judoka in Japan has decreased but I'm happy to see that it's increasing on the whole, around the world, thanks to the educational programmes that are set up. I believe that it is also through education that we will find solutions in my country."" We could listen to Tadahiro Nomura for hours but time flies and everyone has to jump on the next meeting in our busy timetables. We had just a few more minutes to get a conclusion, ""I have one regret, that I could not win a fourth Olympic title. I thought it was possible. I was ready but then I went to a training camp where I got injured and I had to stop. What I can tell you is that throughout my career I've learned a lot and I'm still learning a lot. I want now to make my own contribution, not as an athlete, but as an educator. I may be a champion, but I still need to study more and more. Judo is not only about the medals, it is much more than that.""","['olympic', 'world', 'young', 'learn', 'judo', 'judoka', 'champion', 'lot', 'started', 'japan', 'nomura']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

The latest in this category is Glenn Fairbairn, a former Deutsche Bank managing director, who has arrived in London.Nomura insiders say Fairbairn has been on board for a few weeks and that he's responsible for equity solutions trading in EMEA and for prime finance in Europe. Last week, Nomura suspended Dougal Brech, global head of the prime-brokerage division, along with Joshua Kurek, head of prime broking in the U.S., and co-head of global equities Michael Caperonis.Fairbairn therefore looks like some extra muscle in Europe. He spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a managing director and held roles as everything from head of Asian structuring, to co-head of the bank's strategic equity transactions Group (SETG) for Europe and emerging markets. Fairbairn left Deutsche in June 2019 ahead of the closure of the German bank's equities business. He's spent the past few years as an independent advisor.Nomura's other big hire in London this year is FX star and veteran Kevin Connors, who is expected to build out a team.The Japanese bank announced its full year results for 2020 last week. Thanks to Archegos, the wholesale bank made a loss of $1.5bn for the full year. However, fixed income sales and trading revenues were up 31% and investment banking revenues (M&A, ECM and DCM) were up 35%.In comments accompanying last week's results, Takumi Kitamura, Nomura's CFO, said Archegos, ""was a very specific individual case,"" and that Nomura will be reviewing its risk management framework to avoid a repeat. Kitamura added that the U.S. business is strategically important to Nomura and there's no intention of changing direction (for now). In a separate media briefing, Nomura CEO Kentaro Okuda confirmed that the bank has no major plans to change its U.S. strategy.Nonetheless, this week's bonus round could have implications for strategy in future: if Nomura pays dismally, it may struggle to retain staff, particularly in areas like fixed income trading that had an excellent year.Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you’d like to share?

""If we finance activity, we want these disclosures and if clients are unwilling to give that, well there may be other banks that give them that same exposure, but it won't be us.""Given the ""unusual"" situation, Weber revealed that UBS is conducting an internal investigation to get to the root of the issue.

Nomura,3,PyNews API,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-changing-jobs-now-can-lead-to-a-salary-increase-2021-4,Now may be the best time to switch jobs — and make more money,"This year could be an opportune time to switch jobs and increase your salary.Even before the pandemic, switching jobs was a solid way to bump up your salary.""Switching jobs is one of the best ways to make more money,"" Nick Bunker, the economic-research director for North America at Indeed's Hiring Lab, said.Bunker said he ""would not be shocked"" if the quit rate picked up this year, with many people voluntarily switching roles.""There are a lot of jobs to be found remote freelancing,"" Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, a platform for hiring remote workers, said.","This year could be an opportune time to switch jobs and increase your salary.That's because hiring is picking up and employers are increasingly open to remote talent.Many workers around the world are already planning a job or career change.See more stories on Insider's business page.It could be time to try something new. You might find a role that suits you better and pays more than your current gig.Hiring is picking up as the economy recovers from the pandemic recession . US postings on the job-search platform Indeed on April 9 were 17.9% above what they were on February 1, 2020, the pre-pandemic baseline. Employers are also increasingly willing to hire remote talent, meaning job seekers have more options to choose from now than they had before the pandemic hit.With this extra leverage, job seekers are ready: Microsoft recently reported that of 31,092 full-time workers around the world, more than 40% said they were considering leaving their job this year. In the process, they could boost their earnings.Even before the pandemic, switching jobs was a solid way to bump up your salary. A 2017 Nomura analysis found that employees who changed jobs earned roughly 1% more year over year compared with people who stayed with the same employer.""Switching jobs is one of the best ways to make more money,"" Nick Bunker, the economic-research director for North America at Indeed's Hiring Lab, said. ""Hopefully that translates into a boost for people's paychecks up and down the wage distribution.""Quitting has already reached pre-pandemic levelsThe US quit rate tends to plummet during recessions, and that's what happened last spring, at the same time as unemployment hit record levels. But by September, the quit rate had bounced back, Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.""The average person who's employed is about as likely to quit their job as they were before the pandemic,"" Bunker said.A big reason for this anomaly could be that the pandemic recession wasn't your typical economic downturn, in which people are holding on to their jobs for dear life. It was more of a public-health crisis that, in turn, decimated the economy. Many people quit their jobs because they were worried about getting exposed to the virus or they needed to care for family members.Bunker said he ""would not be shocked"" if the quit rate picked up this year, with many people voluntarily switching roles. ""There's probably lots of people who are reevaluating some things about their jobs and their current working situation,"" he said.Many professionals are rethinking their work situationsDuring the pandemic, many people found that they preferred working remotely to working in an office. An April Prudential survey found that 42% of US workers who were remote said they'd look for a new job if their employer didn't let them work remotely long term.Other prospective quitters are members of what The New York Times' Kevin Roose called the ""YOLO economy."" They've saved money, and now they're ready for something new — whether that means a different job or leaving the proverbial rat race.Still, other people think the grass on the other side is greener — literally.For workers with in-demand skills, there's probably another employer willing to pay them more than what they're making now.Bunker said he was optimistic that workers in relatively low-wage occupations would benefit just as much as workers in higher-paying roles.""A stronger labor market lets lower-wage workers and younger workers move up the job ladder by moving into a new job or potentially a new field,"" he said.Freelancing, a trend that grew during the past year or so, is also likely to continue post-pandemic.""There are a lot of jobs to be found remote freelancing,"" Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, a platform for hiring remote workers, said. ""And it gives even more flexibility to the way that you work.""And there could be a boost in people's earnings.

Here’s why.,"The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low.It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks.The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous?","Oops.As a former Federal Reserve chair herself, now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen should have known that her comments about the possibility of a need for an interest-rate hike would send markets into a tizzy, and by the end of the day she had walked back her remarks. No matter, as they’d brought about a classic rotation — the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.88% dived 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.66% actually rose slightly.What was interesting was that the bond market didn’t follow suit. The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low. It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates. The currency market wasn’t volatile. So maybe the stock market was vulnerable to selling.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks. The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.The hedge-fund selling was most concentrated in the communications-services and information-technology sectors, according to the BofA data — i.e., the tech winners that have thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Who’s buying? Retail clients were the only group to buy U.S. equities for the third week in a row and have been net buyers for 10 straight weeks, per Bank of America.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous? Well, the April payrolls report on Friday is expected to be a seven-digit affair, after nearly topping a million in March. Even with Federal Reserve policy makers at pains to dismiss signs of surging inflation, they can’t ignore a rapidly healing labor market, so official data showing a surge in jobs creation will inevitably cause market discussion of when the central bank will pull back on its bond buying.“As usual, it looks like the connection between legacy ‘duration proxy’ tech sector/’secular growth’ is the risk into the next two months of ‘peak’ U.S. economic data base-effect, with this week’s heavy U.S. data slate culminating in the CRITICAL Friday NFP, which is expected to be a WHOPPING +++ print and is set to dictate the timing of Fed ‘tapering’ socialization,” said Nomura Securities strategist Charlie McElligott.How whopping? Steve Englander, head of global G-10 currency strategy at Standard Chartered, said a payrolls number in excess of 2 million would scare investors, and anything above 1.5 million would cause “uncertainty.” In other words, the risk is that by Friday, traders might be talking like Yellen did on Tuesday.GM tops forecastsADP reported a 742,000 rise in private-sector payrolls for April, which was below economist expectations.

Its topline jumped 34.6 per cent on-year to Rs 13,784 crore in the final quarter of the financial year 2020-21, reflecting strong demand and pricing conditions for the industry.Nomura said the company’s performance beat all consensus estimates. “With about 1 per cent higher blended realization and 1 per cent lower costs versus our estimates, blended per unit Ebitda at Rs 1,321 was 6 per cent above our estimate,” said Aditya Bansal of Nomura.He values the stock at 16 times FY23 EV/Ebitda and maintains a ‘buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 7,650, implying an 18 per cent upside. “UltraTech Cement is our preferred pick in the cement space,” he said.UltraTech Cement has grown its market share further due to high clinker availability, which helped it meet strong demand for ordinary portland cement in the fourth quarter of FY21.Its India volumes grew 30 per cent and 5 per cent YoY in Q4 and FY21, respectively. That was much higher than the growth rates of 24 per cent, 24 per cent and 22 per cent reported by Dalmia Bharat, Ambuja Cements and ACC for the March quarter, respectively.“Market share gains should continue, aided by the ongoing 20 mtpa expansion program, which should drive 11 per cent volume CAGR over FY21-24,” said Amit Murarka, an analyst at Motilal Oswal.The company’s performance has been robust throughout the year despite Covid related disruptions. The second wave, which is having a devastating effect on the country, may have some impact but the company is expected to come out of it triumphantly.The company management said rising Covid-19 cases are a near-term risk to cement demand. However, it remains optimistic on the strong upcycle for cement demand over the next 3-5 years. It expects demand growth to be broad-based across segments. The management expects energy costs to stabilise by the third quarter of FY22.“While we expect industry volumes to decline by 25-30% in the near term due to Covid-related lockdowns, the same should be partly compensated by improved margins as prices have been strong. Our earnings estimates for UltraTech Cement for FY22-23 are therefore broadly unchanged. We estimate 19% EPS CAGR,” said Murarka, who has a target price of Rs 8,050, indicating a potential upside of 24 per cent.The company has a strong pan-India distribution network and the preferred supplier status for key infrastructure projects makes it well suited to tap into expected growth in both retail and institutional cement demand in India.While it is ramping up its under-utilized acquired capacities, it also has a strong pipeline of expansion projects that offers strong growth visibility, said analysts.Debt in the company’s book also continues to decline. Net debt fell by Rs 2,700 crore in the March quarter to Rs 6,700 crore. Capex for the year was at Rs 1,900 crore. Even as operational expenditure was more than expected, lower costs led to the margin beat.ICICI Securities pegs the stock at Rs 8,000 in 12 months and CLSA believes it may hit Rs 7,500 during this period. The stock dropped 1.5 per cent in Monday’s trade to Rs 6,388.","['ultratechs', '25', 'cement', 'stock', 'costs', 'rs', 'crore', 'analysts', 'upside', 'q4', 'demand', 'strong', 'growth', 'impressed', 'cent', 'quarter']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

This week: With the release of Gia Coppola’s new movie, Mainstream, we’re highlighting other work from the extended Coppola family.AdvertisementThe Darjeeling Limited (2007)The Darjeeling Limited starts in media res with Wes Anderson stalwart Bill Murray rushing to make a train. The action sequence is a grift, though. Subverting the expectations of viewers, who might think they’re in store for another dollhouse tale of old men dealing with their screwed-up offspring, one of the film’s actual leads, Adrien Brody, outpaces Murray, catches the train, and wrestles control of the narrative away from Anderson’s past. This isn’t Rushmore or The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. We’re in uncharted territory, and that goes beyond the film’s overseas location.Written by Anderson and two new writing collaborators, Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola, The Darjeeling Limited is often cited as the director’s worst film. But its problems are in service of something greater: getting Anderson out of his comfort zone. Sure, there are plenty of g od’s-eye shots, characters who dress exclusively in metaphor, and maladjusted large adult sons pining for parental affection. But with the help of the Coppolas (Schwartzman is the son of Oscar-nominated actor Talia Shire, who in turn is the sister of Godfather director ​Francis Ford Coppola), the filmmaker was able to make his most freewheeling movie since his debut feature, Bottle Rocket.Darjeeling follows the Whitman brothers, Jack (Schwartzman), Francis (Owen Wilson), and Peter (Brody), as they travel by train across India following the death of their father. Still reeling from the trauma, the three wear their pain in the form of totems from their past and personality traits picked up from their parents. Like many white people before them, they hope that the waters of the Ganges will heal them of a lifetime of dysfunction. Jack, a short story writer with youngest child syndrome, frequently insists that his characters are strictly fictional. All the same, it’s hard not to read the principles of Darjeeling as stand-ins for the writers who created them. Francis directs the trip like Anderson directs a movie. Peter spends much of the runtime behind his father’s prescription sunglasses, which look exactly like the ones worn by Roman Coppola in his Wikipedia photo. And Jack is, well, Schwartzman.G/O Media may get a commission Exclusive for new customers Caliper CBD $35 at Caliper Use the promo code KINJATENDarjeeling marks the first collaboration between Roman Coppola and Anderson, one of the director’s most consistent partnerships since Owen Wilson. But while Coppola shook Anderson loose, eventually helping him to greater heights with Moonrise Kingdom, the writers develop some questionable new habits that would haunt Anderson’s work later. It’s a little icky the way Darjeeling treats an entire country and its 1.2 billion occupants like a therapeutic tool for three white guys; none of the people the brothers meet along the way are characters, exactly. (It’s the kind of cultural tourism that would define Anderson’s Isle Of Dogs, which worked from a story conceived by Coppola, Schwartzman, and Kunichi Nomura.) Yet for all the script’s faults, its cowriters helped Anderson tap into a new mode of storytelling without beginnings or endings. The director would revisit this circular structure to greater effect in arguably his best work, The Grand Budapest Hotel.The Darjeeling Limited is better than its reputation suggests. It’s funny and beautiful in all the ways Anderson’s fans and critics know, but with an Altman-esque looseness that feels fresh and exciting and endlessly surprising in a way Anderson’s more rigorously composed films don’t. There’s also a killer soundtrack featuring the music of legendary Bengali director Satyajit Ray, Peter Sarstedt’s Paris-inspired earworm “Where Do You Go To (My Lovely),” and, of course, three great Kinks songs. These are Anderson’s most unlik able characters to date, yet we’re strangely closer to them, a part of their journey. With a vital assist from his cowriters, the director frees himself from some of the constraints of his meticulously orchestrated style and embraces messiness. It’s endearing to see him loosen his grip and enjoy the ride.Availability: The Darjeeling Limited is currently streaming on Amazon Prime. It can also be rented or purchased digitally from Google Play, Apple, YouTube, Fandango, Redbox, DirecTV, and VUDU.","['anderson', 'coppolas', 'darjeeling', 'work', 'movie', 'sent', 'schwartzman', 'abroad', 'director', 'coppola', 'andersons', 'limited', 'wes', 'characters']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

To drive employee engagement, technology leaders need to adopt and embrace a culture of learning. And this must begin at the very top. If employees witness senior leadership investing in the program, they will automatically have a better understanding of how their own learning and development feeds directly into the strategy of the business and its overall objectives. The c-suite should actively demonstrate their own involvement in upskilling, discussing its importance in all-hands or town hall meetings. After all, if they are not prepared to get involved, why should they expect their employees to?At a granular, team level, building this culture of learning does not need to be complicated. Gamifying learning, by rewarding those in the team who are making progress or hitting milestones, encourages friendly competition and makes upskilling fun and enjoyable. Similarly, it’s critical that employees feel empowered to learn during the working day; upskilling should not have to fall outside of the nine-to-five, when people will have other responsibilities. Encouraging and empowering workers to take a break from their projects and tasks during the day to upskill not only reinforces the importance of their learning and development but offers them ownership of when they do so.Has the pandemic increased the importance of upskilling programs?The motivation and fundamental need for businesses to upskill their workforce has not changed since the pandemic. However, the coronavirus has accelerated the timeline of these programs and demonstrated that if teams are not equipped with the latest digital skills, businesses will lose their market share. Take Topshop, for instance, which went into administration last year after failing to embrace the e-commerce trend.That being said, the pandemic has changed the nature of upskilling programs. With learning and development now conducted remotely, it’s become more important than ever for team leaders and directors to continue to communicate its importance and ensure they are working with their employees to make it a success. Pluralsight’s own research showed that, during the first lockdown, there was a disconnect between the level of upskilling support businesses offered and how much their teams wanted.Given the increased need for digital projects to be completed faster and more efficiently, it’s now imperative that leaders listen to their employees and understand how they can best support them. At a macro level, this could be by providing the right L&D tools that enable them to be flexible in how they upskill, developing their knowledge in bite-sized chunks. Meanwhile, at a micro level, this could be regular, informal check-ins, understanding what they’re finding useful or interesting, and how the team can be brought together under one common objective.How can businesses measure ROI with remote upskilling?Individual companies will all have unique skill requirements based on ongoing projects and specific goals, so ultimately the measurement will be whether the strategic technology needs of the company have been met. For example, Nomura Bank had plans to build and migrate to Nomura Private Cloud, so needed to focus on developing cloud skills at pace. By assessing which skills already existed in the organization and offering tailored training courses to equip employees with the skills needed to deliver the project, a critical business objective was met effectively.At Pluralsight, we fully appreciate that ROI is of paramount importance to employers working to instill a culture of learning & development in their organization, which is why we offer complete transparency via Skill IQ, which measures an individual’s proficiency in any given technology skill. Tracking the skills progression of the team as a whole is a worthwhile tool to measure ROI along the way. Specifically, how many employees are moving from novice to proficient to expert and how quickly?Should employees look to build a personal skill development plan?Building a personal skill development plan empowers employees to take a proactive approach to upskilling, allowing them to steer their career and progress more deliberately, regardless of external factors or changes to their role. The plan provides workers with a set framework to follow and measure their progress against.An effective plan doesn’t just look at what technologists want to achieve with their learning, and which new skills they’d like to adopt, but how they can improve and develop their existing knowledge of tools and frameworks. Technology leaders should work closely with their employees to take stock, evaluate their goals and objectives, identify gaps in their skills repertoire and examine how this relates to wider business and market trends.Once these skills and objectives have been decided upon, an effective skill development plan rests on three factors:Setting a regular cadence: Keeping the plan timely, whether that’s in days, weeks or months, will help keep employees on track, motivated and competitive against their colleagues and their learning habits.Making time in the calendar: Employees should feel comfortable setting aside time in their day to work on their development plan - so having that time blocked out provides them with the option to use it to focus on their own development. It’s neither compulsory nor forced, it just means that employees can be flexible with their learning and prioritize it over meetings or other tasks that may come up during the day.Sharing is caring: Once employees begin to make progress through their plan, it can be a useful exercise to ask them to relay their learnings to their colleagues. This could be in an informal meeting, a blog, tutorial or an internal forum. It demonstrates that the plan has been effective and successfully upskilled the employee in question.","['skills', 'workforce', 'upskilling', 'skill', 'need', 'plan', 'remote', 'upskill', 'team', 'technology', 'development', 'learning', 'leaders', 'employees']",2021-05-07,,LCH SA

The lure is an industry that’s becoming increasingly high tech as it pivots away from the combustion engine, with sensors and operating systems making cars more like computers, and the prospect of autonomy re-envisioning how people use will them.As the world’s biggest market for new-energy cars, China is a key battlefield. Established automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. are already slogging it out with local upstarts such as market darling Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. Over the past three months, Huawei, smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp., Baidu -- which runs China’s top search engine and a mapping app -- and even Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn have joined the fray, forging tie-ups and unveiling their own carmaking plans.Nowhere was that more on display than at last month’s Shanghai Auto Show, which has become one of the world’s premier events for showcasing the hottest new trends in the automotive sector. Visitors queued for hours to access the pavilions of Huawei and Baidu, thronging their displays and snapping pictures of sensor systems, high-tech dashboards and model vehicles. But despite the intense interest, the era of the new car is a hyper-competitive one in China, and tech giants have a lot to prove.“There’s a big element of faith in the tech companies’ bets,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director of consultancy AlixPartners in Shanghai and a former Ford Motor Co. executive. “This is a matter of creating something new that doesn’t exist now. That’s where the element of faith comes into play.”Huawei has been at the fore, recently announcing plans to invest $1 billion in EVs and its own self-driving technology, which it claims has “already surpassed” electric car pioneer Tesla Inc. in some aspects.The Shenzhen-based company, better known for its mobile-phone networks and being the subject of crippling U.S. sanctions, has unveiled its first car developed with BAIC BluePark Mew Energy Technology Co. The mid-sized Arcfox S sedan uses HI, or Huawei Inside, an intelligent automotive software package that enables it to run on autonomous driving mode in city areas for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) without human intervention. Delivery is slated to start in the fourth quarter.Huawei’s auto show display attracted larger crowds than nearby China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., an EV upstart that took one of the biggest stands to showcase nine models despite the fact it hasn’t sold a car under its own brand. As well as the Arcfox S sedan, a Seres SF5 coupe equipped with Huawei Inside was on display, along with Huawei’s HiFin Intelligent Antenna Solution, a new generation in-vehicle communication system plus 4D-imaging radar that’s used to monitor roads and traffic.One of the biggest challenges for new entrants to the automotive sector is how capital and resource intensive it is to make cars. How tech companies negotiate that will be key, and potentially provide opportunities for established players in the sector, with Huawei repeatedly saying its plan is not to produce its own vehicles. Rather, it’s partnering with three Chinese automakers -- BAIC Motor Corp., Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. -- to make self-driving cars that will carry its name as a sub-brand.Guangzhou Auto will jointly build a “truly unmanned car” that will be produced in 2024, President Feng Xingya said last month. The carmaker will also cooperate with Huawei on big data, smart cockpits, and hardware and electronic chips, Feng said.“China adds 30 million cars each year and the number is growing,” Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said in April. “Even if we don’t tap the market outside of China, if we can earn an average 10,000 yuan ($1,550) from each car sold in China, that’s already a very big business.”Apple appears to be considering a similar route, talking at one point with carmakers including Hyundai Motor Co. before discussions fizzled. Unlike China’s tech giants, Apple is keeping its plans largely secret. The company lost a key manager overseeing its self-driving car program in February and it’s unclear what impact that may have had on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.The rise of smart vehicles and autonomous driving throws up a raft of possibilities for tech companies, not least access to data such as real-time insight into popular destinations and the routes taken to get there. On top of that, for some there’s the opportunity to charge for tech add-ons and system improvements, essentially treating the vehicle like a piece of computer hardware that constantly gets its software updated.“They will definitely focus on being intelligent,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Autoforesight Co. “Making a good electrified car is a ‘pass,’ while making a good intelligent car will make an ‘A-grade.’ That’s what these tech giants are good at. Their main revenue will not be from selling the car but finding other ways to earn post-sale, such as over-the-air system upgrades or software subscriptions.”Big Tech in China Is Eyeing EVs for a Reason: Hyperdrive DailyFirst MoversBaidu -- which started investing in robo-taxi technology as early as 2013 and funded Chinese EV startup WM Motors -- now plans to spend $7.7 billion over the next five years developing smart-car technology via its newly established unit Jidu Auto. The division aims to launch its first model in three years, followed by new releases every 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Xia Yiping said.“The core value of cars in the future will be how intelligent they are,” Xia said, echoing a familiar refrain. “The earlier a company plans, the more control of self-developed technologies it gains, the more advanced technology it has, the more power it will own in the market.”Jidu has a core team of about 100 staff, and will expand to as many as 3,000 personnel by the end of next year, including up to 500 software engineers, he said. The first batch of cars will be based on Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s pure EV manufacturing structure, while Jidu will collaborate with Baidu’s autonomous-driving unit Apollo, with a special focus on smart cars and the mass production of autonomous driving features. The unit will embark on its next fundraising round soon, with further investment expected from Baidu and external investors.Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has also announced plans to invest about $10 billion over the next decade to manufacture electric cars, though hasn’t disclosed much detail or given a timeframe for deliveries. Billionaire co-founder Lei Jun in March announced his intention to lead a new standalone division and spearhead the drive into EVs, in what he called his final major startup endeavor.“We have deep pockets for this project,” Lei, who is also Xiaomi’s chief executive officer, said when unveiling the plan. “I’m fully aware of the risks of the car-making industry. I’m also aware the project will take at least three-to-five years with tens of billions of investment.”While China’s tech giants may be late to the game and entering unfamiliar territory, that could play to their advantage, said Dyer of AlixPartners.“This isn’t an industry where you have to be the first-mover to win,” he said. “In fact, in the auto industry, the first mover typically never wins. It’s always the follower who wins. Because when you are the first mover, you’re the one paying to learn through all the mistakes.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['lightning', 'announce', 'closing', 'emotors', 'car', 'cars', 'china', 'intelligent', 'giants', 'business', 'combination', 'thats', 'huawei', 'technology', 'gigcapital3', 'tech', 'plans']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

D’autres prix ont décidé de ne pas choisir un seul lauréat, mais de partager la récompense entre chaque finaliste, en signe de solidarité avec le monde de la culture.

And that’s unlikely to change any time soon.According to a Bloomberg report, Sony has warned analysts that the console will suffers shortages ‘through 2022’.The analysts were being briefed following Sony’s most recent financial results, which showed that 7.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles have been sold so far, with an aim to sell 14.8 million by the end of Sony’s financial year next March.Despite the shortages that means that the console is still selling more than the PlayStation 4 at the same point in its life. If that trajectory is maintained, it means the PlayStation 5 could end up as at least the second best selling home console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2.The stock issues are in large part because of the general shortage of semiconductors around the world, a situation which Sony has no control over.‘I don’t think demand is calming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,’ said Sony’s Hiroki Totoki.Analysts are worried though, that with lockdown over in most major markets the surge in demand for home entertainment might already have peaked. One example used for this is that monthly active users for PSN fell from 114 million in the last quarter of 2020 to 109 million at the beginning of 2021.Since the semiconductor shortages affect everyone, Microsoft are in a similar position. Although they’ve previously said that stock issues will continue only until June. It’s unclear, though, how significant the change in availability will be at that point.Even Nintendo has had to warn its investors that they might not be able to build enough Switch consoles to go around, something that may affect the much-rumoured Switch Pro model – if and when it’s announced.Email gamecentralmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.MORE : New PS5 console redesign due for release next year claim sourcesMORE : Among Us coming to PS4 and PS5 with Ratchet & Clank bonus contentMORE : Returnal review – the best game on PS5Follow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentralmetro.co.ukFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.","['ps5', 'hold', 'continue', 'stock', 'playstation', 'analysts', 'shortages', 'million', 'sony', 'admits', 'demand', 'sonys', 'console']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

Malgré toute la sympathie que suscite cette voleuse de Yuffie, les plus pressés des rôlistes pensent déjà à l'après.A voir aussi : Tales of Arise : Monde ouvert, linéarité, évolutions... Notre interview exclusiveCelui qui se fait pour l'heure appeler Final Fantasy VII Remake Part. 2 a rapidement passé une tête lors du livestream diffusé par le géant du J-RPG ce weekend, par l'intermédiaire de Tetsuya Nomura, quand bien même il n'en serait plus co-réalisateur.Je sais rien, mais je dirai toutSi l'intéressé avait déjà parlé de la transition et du développement sur PlayStation 5, il a cette fois pris des gants pour évoquer l'après-Midgar. Preuve que l'heure est grave, le trublion a même osé l'impensable : demander son avis préalable au producteur Yoshinori Kitase. Non ? Si :Je vois beaucoup de commentaires de gens qui demandent ce qu'il se passe avec ""Part. 2"". Je me doutais que cela allait arriver, alors ce matin, j'ai appelé Kitase pour lui demander si je pouvais au moins en parler un peu.C'est rapidement devenu un sacré bazar. Il nous a fallu obtenir l'autorisation de plusieurs départements, alors même que je ne comptais pas dire grand chose ! Mais j'étais presque coincé : il y a tellement de responsables différents qui doivent donner leur feu vert que moi-même, j'ai été surpris. A-t-on besoin de vérifier ça avec autant de monde ? Je pensais qu'il fallait juste poser la question.Donc, ce que je peux dire, c'est que le développement se passe bien. Nous ferons des annonces au moment venu, mais en ce moment, sachez que Cloud évolue au milieu de beaucoup de nature. L'ambiance et l'atmosphère sont très différentes de ""Part. 1"", et je pense donc que les joueurs l'apprécieront. Sachez aussi que l'histoire de ""Part. 2"" débutera juste après la fin d'Intergrade, alors nous espérons que vous y jouerez !Voilà qui ressemblerait presque à de la publicité déguisée. Sacré Nomura. Pour découvrir les aventures de Yuffie, et donc découvrir où reprendra l'intrigue de l'aventure, il faudra patienter jusqu'à l'arrivée de Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade sur PS5 (en attendant d'éventuels portages), le 11 juin prochain.Merci à aitaikimochi pour la traduction.","['final', 'remake', 'à', 'vii', 'donne', 'des', 'du', 'la', 'fantasy', 'qui', 'que', 'nouvelles', 'je', 'pour', 'le', 'il', 'ce', 'développement', 'plus', 'nomura']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

Morgan Stanley,4,Google API,https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-aws-public-cloud-calculate-equity-trading-risk-2021-5,Morgan Stanley uses 3 billion data points each day to measure its equity risk. Here's how it's using AWS to do it.,"Morgan Stanley uses cloud computing to gauge the risk of its equity positions each day.A bank's risk model might consider billions of data points each dayValue-at-risk, or VaR, is the high-level metric most often associated with risk management.Bring all those factors together, and a risk model has a lot of data to consider.When designing the system, Chawla said, Morgan Stanley needed something that could handle a ""large variable workload.""Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Nomura, and UBS were among banks to report losses as a result of prime-brokerage businesses tied to Archegos.","Morgan Stanley uses cloud computing to gauge the risk of its equity positions each day.Vikas Chawla, a tech executive at Morgan Stanley, spoke about the benefits of the cloud.Chawla said flexibility and speed are key for managing risk in changing market conditions.See more stories on Insider's business page.When the US stock market closes at 4:00 p.m. each afternoon in New York, it typically marks an end to the day for the equity traders working across Wall Street's banks. Once they mark and sign off on their positions, they're out the door.For others who sit near trading desks, however, their work is just beginning. One such example is the risk employees — and the data models they run — that calculate a bank's exposure to the markets after the close of each trading day.As is the case with many other banking functions, speed and scale are key. That's why more firms have looked to lean on the public cloud to be more efficient.It was a trend highlighted by Vikas Chawla, an executive director on Morgan Stanley's enterprise technology and services team, at a symposium hosted by Amazon Web Services on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley's embrace of cloud technology has enabled the bank to more flexibly model the exposure it faces from ""a few million positions"" on its equities trading desk each day, Chawla said. The tech means the bank can scale up — or down — the amount of computing power it needs on a daily basis.""Sometimes on a good day, we could have six hours to calculate risk, but in times of high volatility, it's possible that we might have half the time, in three hours. Now this is where the cloud is very attractive,"" Chawla said.A bank's risk model might consider billions of data points each dayValue-at-risk, or VaR, is the high-level metric most often associated with risk management. It's a model that takes into account three factors: a time-frame (typically a day, a month, or a 250-day trading year); the positions a bank has in equities, currencies, or any other securities; and hypothetical risk scenarios or exogenous shocks (like a major market move).Bring all those factors together, and a risk model has a lot of data to consider.Vikas Chawla, executive director with Morgan Stanley's enterprise technology and services team. Morgan Stanley""The combination of the number of positions, the number of days, and the scenarios means that we have to do at least 3 billion data points on a nightly basis,"" Chawla said.When designing the system, Chawla said, Morgan Stanley needed something that could handle a ""large variable workload.""The bank ultimately designed its equities risk system around Amazon EC2 Spot, a cloud-native web service that lets customers leverage unused cloud compute in the event they need it and save on costs in the meantime.The system rollout came at an opportune time, as the bank had to deal with large trading volumes throughout the start of 2021. Equity trading revenues were up 17% from the year-ago quarter, the bank reported during its first-quarter earnings.Changing market conditions means that ""new risks can happen, which can necessitate the creation of much more complex models, which in turns leads to needing much more computing,"" Chawla said.Morgan Stanley is on a well-publicized journey of adopting cloud tech broadly across the bank. In February, the firm announced the appointment of its first-ever head of cloud and architecture, Bobby Gilja, a 34-year Morgan Stanley veteran. And in 2018, the bank announced the creation of a cloud center of excellence.Risk management, in general, has been a key consideration of Wall Street executives recently.The blow up of Archegos Capital Management has led to an increased focus on firm's risk-management practices and transparency into what can be sometimes opaque family offices.Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Nomura, and UBS were among banks to report losses as a result of prime-brokerage businesses tied to Archegos.","['equity', 'trading', 'points', 'positions', 'morgan', 'using', 'model', 'day', 'stanley', 'measure', 'heres', 'chawla', 'risk', 'uses', 'bank', 'market', 'cloud']",2021-05-05,,LCH SA

Morgan Private Bank(Left to right, top to bottom:) Brian Swenson, Eric Smith, Jesse Bohannon, Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter moved to Morgan Stanley from J.P. Morgan Private Bank.The group is led by advisors Brian R. Swenson, Eric T. Smith, and Jesse F. Bohannon and also includes support staff Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter. They had overseen $2.8 billion in customer assets, and have joined Morgan Stanley’s private wealth management business after a 90-day garden leave, the source confirmed.Swenson, who spent his career at J.P. Morgan since he first registered there in 2006, according to BrokerCheck, did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. He officially joined Morgan Stanley on May 3, according to the database, although Smith and Bohannon registered with the wirehouse in March and January, respectively.Swenson had been a managing director at J.P. Morgan, a corporate title that a source at the firm said previously carries a 90-day garden leave, while others moving with him were likely obligated to wait only 60 days or fewer before joining their new firm.Swenson had also been head of the private banking business in Utah and Idaho, according to LinkedIn, which shows he started as an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Denver after graduating in 2003 from Brigham Young University.Smith, who was an executive director, started his career at J.P. Morgan in 2011. Bohannon spent a rookie year at Jefferies in 2015 and worked at Morgan Stanley between 2016 and 2018 before joining J.P. Morgan, according to BrokerCheck.A J.P. Morgan spokesperson confirmed the departure but declined to comment on client assets or production figures.J.P. Morgan in March tapped private banker Kristin Schaefer to replace Swenson as market lead in the two states, according to an internal memo sent March 9. Schaefer had been with J.P. Morgan since 2020, when she left Wells Fargo & Co.’s Private Bank.She had also worked as a global banking consultant at Wells Fargo in Palo Alto, California, before moving to Utah in 2016, according to the memo, and reports to Geoff Barker, J.P. Morgan Private Bank Market Manager for the Rockies Region.“Her depth of experience, the global power of J.P. Morgan and local expertise of the Private Bank team will deepen our commitment to the region and offer a wealth management platform not seen before in this market,” Barker said in the memo.Swenson’s team follows a path of large salaried banking teams who have been joining traditional brokerage firms with increasing frequency over the past year. Recruiters have said wirehouses have turned a fresh eye to those teams, which they had historically not targeted given the garden-leave policies and customer bank ties that can make transferring assets difficult.UBS Wealth Management USA last week recruited what several sources said was one of the largest teams at J.P. Morgan, a Dallas group led by Cindy Brown who generated $75 million in revenue from $25 billion in assets. It also hired a $2 billion-AUM team from Bank of America’s private bank in California.Merrill Lynch last month recruited a Citibank private banker in San Francisco who reportedly oversaw $17 billion in client assets.Morgan Stanley has been aggressively recruiting large broker teams across the industry since it restarted its recruiting engine last year after pulling out in 2017 of the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, the industry recruiting and client solicitation pact. Morgan Stanley no longer breaks out specific headcount, which a spokesperson said last month is around 16,000, including several hundred call-center based brokers.J.P.

Investors looked to leverage as much of that momentum as they could by moving away from pricey so-called growth stocks, such as big technology companies, toward what are known as value stocks, which are more closely linked to the underlying economy, such as the infrastructure and banking sectors.The European region is more heavily exposed to those sectors that benefit from economic recovery, such as industrials, retail, and transport, while the US market has more exposure to tech stocks, many of which were considered COVID-19 stay-at-home winners.Yet even with the recovery fully gaining traction in developed markets, Europe's relative flows remain at the low end of historical ranges compared with the record inflows that global equities have seen in the past three months, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.In a report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analysts said global investors should consider the European region.The Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Garman said Europe had outperformed MSCI's All Country World Index since February ""yet there is little evidence of love for the region in a global context.""Relative valuations are close to 10-year lows, and even when adjusted by sector Europe still looks cheap relative to MSCI's All Country World Index, a leading global index, Garman said.European equities have matched the performance of US blue-chip stocks so far this year. The STOXX 600 — an index of major European shares — is up about 11% in 2021, the same as the S&P 500.Morgan Stanley said rising government-bond yields were driving a better period for European equities. Over the past 12 months, however, European shares have lagged their US peers. The STOXX 600 has gained about 30%, while the S&P 500 has risen by over 40% to record highs this month.This could soon come to a halt, however.Morgan Stanley's US economists are predicting the Federal Reserve might start discussing slowing the pace of its asset purchases, or quantitative easing, when it meets in June, a tool it used to support the economy.Many analysts believe quantitative easing has inflated asset prices and that tapering, in turn, could create a slowdown in the stock market.""Assuming longer-term growth outlook remains favorable, such a period should represent a temporary pause/reset in a bull market rather than anything more extreme — over the long run, equity markets generally track underlying EPS trends,"" Garman said.Despite the potential pause to the bull-market rally in the US, the analysts expect Europe's economic momentum to further boost European equity performance over the summer.The analysts also emphasize that investors should worry less about the region's sectoral mix compared with previous years.""In each of the last 10 years, Europe's sector composition has acted as a drag, with the lack of tech the biggest contributor to this,"" Garman said.The mix is now changing. Technology is now the biggest sector within the STOXX 50, an index of the 50 largest eurozone stocks.""This ongoing change implies higher and less volatile trend EPS growth going forward, and should also make it easier for global investors looking for exposure to structural growth to engage with European equities,"" Garman said.A graph of technology's share of European initial public offerings from Morgan Stanley's Wednesday research note. Morgan StanleyStock picksTaking this outlook into consideration, the analysts highlight 20 stocks that are rated ""buy"" and look cheap compared with competitors elsewhere despite boasting leading global business models and comparable growth to their rivals.The analysts said they felt it was important to highlight companies with strong global franchises, as their clients tell them they are seeking out European equity investments that are broader, with a global focus and that still look affordable.","['european', 'index', 'stocks', 'models', 'dirtcheap', 'morgan', 'growth', 'rocksolid', 'rally', 'stanley', 'analysts', 'buy', 'garman', 'global', 'including', 'investors']",2021-05-07,,LCH SA

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeMonday, May 10, 2021A labor demand problem would be worse. This wasn't that.The April U.S. employment report stunned investors when it revealed employers added just 266,000 to their payrolls last month, far fewer than the 1,000,000 expected by economists.""It is hard to square this middling outcome with a variety of other data indicating that the labor market is scorching hot,"" JPMorgan's Michael Feroli said. Indeed, lots of measures of activity and sentiment have pointed to the need for more hiring, which has actually been confirmed by falling initial claims for unemployment insurance and alternative reports on hiring.Friday's report immediately ignited a massive debate among economists, policymakers, and pundits about the degree to which enhanced unemployment benefits are incentivizing capable workers to stay on the sidelines, exacerbating what may be a short-term labor shortage. We're sure this conversation will continue in the week ahead.One crucial thing folks do seem to agree on about Friday's report is that did not reflect a demand problem.""The miss in nonfarm payroll growth in April certainly gives some credence to anecdotal reports of labor shortages and individuals not returning to work while remaining on supplemental unemployment benefits, suggesting this is a supply-side rather than a demand-side issue,"" Morgan Stanley economists wrote.There's certainly no shortage of reports confirming robust demand for labor.The National Federation of Independent Business said a record 44% of small business owners had job openings in April. Online job listing giant Indeed said the number of job postings was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the official monthly payrolls report, recently said job openings were at a two-year high.Story continues""We know from endless surveys that labor demand is very strong, but we also know from both surveys and media-reported anecdotes that firms are finding it hard to recruit people, despite a 6.1% unemployment,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson said.This report still offers plenty of unanswered questions, not the least of which is the impact of enhanced unemployment benefits. How many of would-be workers are still fearful of COVID-19? Or struggling with childcare? Or just waiting to be called off of their furlough?These are all arguably high quality problems as these labor shortage issues are largely occurring in the context of an economy looking to accelerate.It may seem odd to put a positive spin on a jobs report that fell short of expectations by a historic margin. But it certainly would've been worse if the shortfall was due to lack of employers seeking workers (demand) instead of employers struggling to fill open positions (supply).""Lack of labor demand is not the problem,"" Shepherdson said.

Irwan Serigar as defendants, whereby the company is accusing them of alleged breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conspiracy, breach of trust and dishonest assistance.It claimed that Arul Kanda and Irwan Serigar are liable for fraudulent breach of duties and fraudulent breach of trust, resulting in the company paying a sum of US$1.83 billion to 1MDB PetroSaudi Ltd, which was converted into stakes in Brazen Sky and then converted into investment in Bridge Global Fund.1MDB is also claiming that the duo allegedly committed fraudulent breach of duties and breach of trust towards International Petroleum Investment Corporation (IPIC) and Aabar PJS, resulting in a payment of US$1.265 billion being paid to IPIC on May 9, 2017 as part of the consent award and US$3.5 billion being misappropriated from the company to Aabar BVI.In total, 1MDB is claiming US$6.59 billion from the duo as a result of the purported breach and an additional RM2.9 million against Irwan Serigar for fraudulent breach of duties and trust resulting in the extension employment agreement.Foreign financial institutions1MDB also named Deutsche Bank, Coutts & Co (Switzerland) and JP Morgan (Switzerland), along with PetroSaudi International and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Ltd, as well as its co-founder Tarek Obaid and director Patrick Mohany as defendants in the third suit.1MDB cites negligence breach of contract, conspiracy to defraud and dishonest assistance, where it is seeking US$1.11 billion from Deutsche Bank, US$1.03 billion from Coutts & Co plus interests, US$800 million from JP Morgan and interests on the sum, and US$1.83 billion from the two PetroSaudi companies and Tarek plus interests and US$153 million from Mahony.This resulted in the total quantum sought to be US$4.923 billion. Tarek and PetroSaudi are alleged to be responsible for the 1MDB PetroSaudi venture and transfers to Good Star Ltd, an entity owned by Jho Low as testified in the 1MDB trial.Tarek, along with Mahony, are also facing criminal charges along with Jho Low for criminal conspiracy involving 1MDB and Najib. There are also at present separate forfeiture proceedings against PetroSaudi and Tarek for the country to recover US$340 million as part of the funds in the joint venture (JV) to form 1MDB PetroSaudi.Earlier, it was reported that lawyers for Tarek and PetroSaudi Oil Services (Venezuela) Ltd had approached the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) to settle the matter, but they were said to have offered only half of the amount sought by Malaysia.Jho Low and three others1MDB also filed claims against Jho Low, his father Hock Peng, sister May Lin and his close associate Eric Tan for fraudulent concealment, fraudulent misappropriation of funds, unjust enrichment, breach of trust and conspiracy, where a total of US$1.402 billion are sought from them.Of that, a sum of US$1.03 billion is sought from Jho Low, followed by his associate Tan (US$41 million), Hock Peng (US$328 million) and US$3.5 million from May Lin.Jho Low is said to be the mastermind in the whole 1MDB scandal and action has been brought against him in various jurisdictions, including in the US for forfeiture.Lastly, the action against legal firm Wong & Partners, along with its senior partner Chia, is for purported breach of contractual, statutory, common law and fiduciary duties, as well as dishonest assistance in misappropriation of funds. 1MDB is seeking US$1 billion and legal fees of RM664,821.21.Read also:Finance Ministry confirms 1MDB, SRC filed civil suits for a combined US$23b, as per The Edge report1MDB and SRC file multibillion-dollar civil suits against those alleged to be responsible for fraudNajib, Shahrol, Ismee and Ibrahim Ali among those named in 16 suits by SRC","['jp', 'files', 'breach', 'fraudulent', 'filed', 'billion', 'petrosaudi', '1mdb', 'suits', 'partners', 'low', 'bank', 'deutsche', 'million', 'coutts', 'tan', 'morgan', 'wong', 'multibillion']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA

The result should be a substantial upgrade to the committee's growth forecasts and a substantial downgrade to its unemployment forecasts.Although no changes to monetary policy are expected, a slowing of the pace of asset purchases is expected by some economists.“The thorny issue for policymakers is whether to use this meeting to announce how and when it will taper bond purchases,” Neil Wilson of Markets.com said.“The yield on 10-year gilts is back to 0.84%, close to the March peak at 0.87% and could top this should the BoE signal it is ready to exit emergency mode.”It is possible that policymakers may prefer to wait until its June meeting, which should give the committee “confidence around recovery, alongside a string of solid data from growth to inflation before slowing the pace of asset purchase,” Deutsche Bank said.However, it is currently on course to hit its £875bn ($1.2tn) target over three months early in September, instead of the end of the year.Watch: Bank of England looks into launching its own 'Britcoin'Read more: ECB to step up bond buying to counter government debt sell-offWilson added: “Ultimately, the question about tightening is really one of timing, but the BoE cannot be blind to the economic data and this meeting could be the time to fire the starting pistol.”Meanwhile, Brian Hillard at Societe Generale said: “It makes more sense to do so at this one in the context of the updated forecasts.Story continuesAs well as the key tapering decision, the BoE may revise its guidance on when it will wind down quantitative easing (QE).The Bank has a lot to factor into its already above-consensus forecasts, including a first quarter upgrade, the March budget and US fiscal policy.Last month, the IMF upgraded the UK's GDP growth for 2021 and 2022, but said activity in the country, along with the euro area, is expected to remain below end-of-2019 levels for the next couple of years.May’s monetary policy report will inevitably have a 2021 growth upgrade, which should see 2021 GDP projected to rise by closer to 7%, up from 5% in February. This would see GDP crossing its pre-virus path later this year.Analysts at Barclays said: “But, how much more can it upgrade without effectively preparing markets for early hikes? We think the MPC will continue to tread carefully, balancing an optimistic narrative with historically high uncertainties.Inflation guidance is expected to be unchanged from its previous note: “The committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.”The Bank of England will publish its latest monetary policy decisions at 12pm on Thursday.Watch: What is inflation and why it is important","['meeting', 'purchases', 'delivers', 'tapering', 'focus', 'bond', 'expected', 'monetary', 'boe', 'upgrade', 'policy', 'bank', 'verdict', 'vaccine', 'growth', 'latest', 'inflation', 'england']",2021-05-05,,LCH SA

It’s the bank’s best quarter since 2008, delivering an annualised return on tangible equity of 12%, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The performance owes much to lower bad debt provisions.

Intesa shares trade at around 0.8 times its tangible book value, implying an 8% return on tangible equity this year. Once Italy lifts a ban on layoffs, many private clients will default. Yet, as consumer credit accounts for just 6% of its loans, less than half the equivalent share for BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Intesa is better placed to weather an increase in defaults.

Markus Schreiber/Pool via REUTERSFive months is a long time in German politics but a mould-breaking surge in support for the Green party ahead of September’s Federal election has markets crunching numbers to assess its likely role in the next ruling coalition.Record high German stock prices, soaring EU carbon permit prices and less negative German debt yields all have other drivers amid hopes for and end to the pandemic shocks of the past 12 months. But they may also be partly feeding off the extraordinary Green Party push in the polls over recent weeks.Investors seldom hold their breath for clarity on German election outcomes as coalitions often take months to form even after September poll results are known.But with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel stepping down after 16 years, there will be a new leader of the world's fourth biggest economy one way or another.Over the past decade in Europe and around the world, that sort of uncertainty has typically brought handwringing about extremist fringe parties or populist disrupters.But as the chancellery in Berlin is set to switch hands, support is swelling for the already popular and largely centrist Greens and their candidate for the top job Annalena Baerbock.Reflecting what now appears like a Transatlantic priority to finally wrestle climate change after the pandemic, Green’s level of support has made it the largest party in two of the last three national opinion polls, ahead of both the centre-right CDU/CSU bloc and centre-left Social Democrats.That represents a big shake-up of the status quo; Deutsche Bank noted that if the polls were correct it would the first election since World War Two that the combined CDU/CSU and SPD vote would fail to be a majority.Even with caveats about polling accuracy and shifting political sands, Deutsche reckons: ""It's no longer implausible that the 40-year old Baerbock could become the first Green chancellor.""Most banks now see the Greens in government of one hue or another after September.Hence all the colour-coded speculation about different permutations that could see anything from a ""Kiwi"" coalition - involving a Green-led government with CDU/CSU black - to a ""traffic light"" mix of Green, SPD red and yellow of the liberal Free Democratic Party.Citi strategists say the Greens are set to be at least the second strongest party and feature in any new government. UBS Global Wealth Management calls that ""extremely likely"".""Government participation by the Greens as very likely, with them possibly in the position of kingmaker,"" Morgan Stanley said.Why should markets care?""Easier fiscal either way,"" it added. ""The balance of power has likely shifted in favour of the Greens.""LIFTING THE DEBT BRAKE?Greater investment spending on green infrastructure and closer European Union integration are basic rules of thumb on more Green influence.But details of the Green manifesto raise a whole stream of market-related issues.Citi calculate Green proposals for 50 billion euros a year in extra public investment over 10 years would be about 1.5% of 2019 output. If scaled to the U.S. economy, it would equate to a $3 trillion demand boost - paid for partly by tax rises.Not unlike the new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden, Greens talk of a 25% corporate tax, a 1% wealth tax on those owning more than 2 million euros and higher income tax.Morgan Stanley said Green polling success could see a longer suspension of Germany's constitutional ""debt brake"" - which limits structural Federal deficits to 0.35% of gross domestic product - and possibly even a wholesale reform to allow for more investment spending while keeping the lid on regular spending.JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi cited a 2019 Green Party paper, co-authored by Baerbock, that supported tax-funded current expenditure and balanced state budgets but more long-term investments financed by public entities.Fuzesi said that in essence the Greens wanted to align Germany's unilateral debt brake with EU rules that allow for structural deficits of 1% of GDP when overall debt loads are less than 60% of GDP.

Markus Schreiber/Pool via REUTERSFive months is a long time in German politics but a mould-breaking surge in support for the Green party ahead of September’s Federal election has markets crunching numbers to assess its likely role in the next ruling coalition.Record high German stock prices, soaring EU carbon permit prices and less negative German debt yields all have other drivers amid hopes for and end to the pandemic shocks of the past 12 months. But they may also be partly feeding off the extraordinary Green Party push in the polls over recent weeks.Investors seldom hold their breath for clarity on German election outcomes as coalitions often take months to form even after September poll results are known.But with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel stepping down after 16 years, there will be a new leader of the world's fourth biggest economy one way or another.Over the past decade in Europe and around the world, that sort of uncertainty has typically brought handwringing about extremist fringe parties or populist disrupters.But as the chancellery in Berlin is set to switch hands, support is swelling for the already popular and largely centrist Greens and their candidate for the top job Annalena Baerbock.Reflecting what now appears like a Transatlantic priority to finally wrestle climate change after the pandemic, Green’s level of support has made it the largest party in two of the last three national opinion polls, ahead of both the centre-right CDU/CSU bloc and centre-left Social Democrats.That represents a big shake-up of the status quo; Deutsche Bank noted that if the polls were correct it would the first election since World War Two that the combined CDU/CSU and SPD vote would fail to be a majority.Even with caveats about polling accuracy and shifting political sands, Deutsche reckons: ""It's no longer implausible that the 40-year old Baerbock could become the first Green chancellor.""Most banks now see the Greens in government of one hue or another after September.Hence all the colour-coded speculation about different permutations that could see anything from a ""Kiwi"" coalition - involving a Green-led government with CDU/CSU black - to a ""traffic light"" mix of Green, SPD red and yellow of the liberal Free Democratic Party.Citi strategists say the Greens are set to be at least the second strongest party and feature in any new government. UBS Global Wealth Management calls that ""extremely likely"".""Government participation by the Greens as very likely, with them possibly in the position of kingmaker,"" Morgan Stanley said.Why should markets care?""Easier fiscal either way,"" it added. ""The balance of power has likely shifted in favour of the Greens.""LIFTING THE DEBT BRAKE?Greater investment spending on green infrastructure and closer European Union integration are basic rules of thumb on more Green influence.But details of the Green manifesto raise a whole stream of market-related issues.Citi calculate Green proposals for 50 billion euros a year in extra public investment over 10 years would be about 1.5% of 2019 output. If scaled to the U.S. economy, it would equate to a $3 trillion demand boost - paid for partly by tax rises.Not unlike the new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden, Greens talk of a 25% corporate tax, a 1% wealth tax on those owning more than 2 million euros and higher income tax.Morgan Stanley said Green polling success could see a longer suspension of Germany's constitutional ""debt brake"" - which limits structural Federal deficits to 0.35% of gross domestic product - and possibly even a wholesale reform to allow for more investment spending while keeping the lid on regular spending.JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi cited a 2019 Green Party paper, co-authored by Baerbock, that supported tax-funded current expenditure and balanced state budgets but more long-term investments financed by public entities.Fuzesi said that in essence the Greens wanted to align Germany's unilateral debt brake with EU rules that allow for structural deficits of 1% of GDP when overall debt loads are less than 60% of GDP. That alone would mean an additional 23 billion euros for those public investment vehicles.And yet this was all within relatively conservative fiscal projections that see national debt/GDP fall to 40% over time as long as the investment spending outlined lifts growth too.""Differences between Germany's centrist parties are often overstated,"" he concluded.Eye-catching Green policies on Europe include making the EU's post-pandemic Recovery Fund a permanent part of the EU budget so the bloc can invest in the coming ""green transition"".That would, it hopes, take pressure off the European Central Bank - which could then adopt a dual mandate of price stability and low unemployment, much like the U.S. Federal Reserve.For markets punchdrunk from the pandemic shock and its huge impact on economic policies, the Green plan may even seem marginal aside from obvious environmental investments per se.Citi argues higher German yields and pro-EU policies could be positive for the euro exchange rate and offset U.S. ""exceptionalism"" related to Washington's recovery spending.But its biggest implication may be to shape the broader “return to normal” over many years - and perhaps help sidestep the slow-growth funk that followed the last global economic shock 12 years ago.The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News.

We’ve had a few very strong months of equity rallies so I wonder how much of this is some investors taking profit and perhaps putting their equity longs on hold for now.”“Today seems to be a little more positioning driven, I think the market’s a little bit jumpy.”""(Yellen) was actually asked about the growing share of government spending to GDP and she was asked a very economist question and she answered in a very economist way, where interest rates to yields might have to rise a little bit for the reallocation of resources and the market read that as rates will have to rise. But I think they’ve already risen. They’ve gone from 1% to where we are now, so its certainly quite a bit already.”""She’s talking about interest rates, and the clearing price for U.S. Treasury debt over the long run, I don’t think it was meant to be an impactful statement that yields will have to rise now.”ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT DAKOTA WEALTH IN FAIRFIELD, CONNECTICUT“It’s concerns about valuations, that the market maybe being overextended, and add to that inflation prospects that were fanned by (Warren) Buffett over this past weekend.""(Big tech earnings) reports were better than expected.

Deutsche Bank,5,PyNews API,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-business-idUSKBN2CN1KO,Analysis-Are U.S. firms ready to do more than voice concerns on trans rights? - Reuters,"Republican lawmakers have introduced a record 175 bills in at least 32 states on trans issues so far this year, according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the country’s largest LGBT+ advocacy group.Most of the legislative proposals seek to stop trans girls and women from competing in school sports, and to restrict children’s access to gender transition-related medical care.It is not the first time big companies have taken a stand on LGBT+ rights issues.Last year, 36 firms signed a statement condemning a Tennessee law allowing adoption agencies to turn away LGBT+ couples on religious grounds.‘POLITICAL WATER’The business community’s stance against conservative trans legislation came soon after leading companies spoke out against U.S. state voting curbs that activist groups say unfairly target Black and other racial minorities.","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leading U.S. companies have become more vocal in criticizing proposed laws restricting transgender rights and taking a stand on LGBT+ issues but have failed so far to take concrete action against states with such legislation, advocates said.Nearly 100 companies, including Facebook, Pfizer and Dell, said late last month they were “deeply concerned” about a slew of trans-related legislative proposals presented recently in conservative states, calling the bills “discriminatory”.Anne Lieberman, director of policy and programs at Athlete Ally, a U.S.-based nonprofit LGBT+ athletic advocacy group, said the joint statement underscored the broader willingness of American corporations to step into the political arena.“Since George Floyd’s murder over the summer, that was really a moment ... where you saw businesses across the country really taking a strong stance in wading into political water in ways they haven’t done before,” Lieberman said.Republican lawmakers have introduced a record 175 bills in at least 32 states on trans issues so far this year, according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the country’s largest LGBT+ advocacy group.Most of the legislative proposals seek to stop trans girls and women from competing in school sports, and to restrict children’s access to gender transition-related medical care.Proponents of the measures say they want to protect young people from medical procedures they could later regret and have voiced concerns that trans athletes have a physical edge that disadvantages girls and women.It is not the first time big companies have taken a stand on LGBT+ rights issues. Last year, 36 firms signed a statement condemning a Tennessee law allowing adoption agencies to turn away LGBT+ couples on religious grounds.“The sheer volume of businesses that engage is higher,” said Jessica Shortall, director of corporate engagement at Freedom For All Americans, an LGBT+ advocacy group that coordinated the statement with HRC.“And honestly, practically speaking, there’s strength and safety in numbers,” Shortall added.‘POLITICAL WATER’The business community’s stance against conservative trans legislation came soon after leading companies spoke out against U.S. state voting curbs that activist groups say unfairly target Black and other racial minorities.Apple, Amazon.com and Starbucks were among more than 100 companies to sign a letter in April opposing “any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot.”Still, some trans rights advocates want business leaders to take a stronger line - as some companies did in North Carolina after the state passed the so-called “bathroom bill” in 2016.The legislation banned trans citizens from using the public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, prompting companies including PayPal, Adidas and Deutsche Bank to axe expansion plans in the state.In an open letter in April, the HRC advocacy group urged companies to refuse new business in states where trans athletes were barred from competing and pull their support from sporting events where trans athletes cannot compete.“Although we certainly appreciate those efforts, they are not enough,” the letter said.More recently, Jennifer Pritzker - the world’s first trans billionaire and a Republican - has threatened to move her family’s business out of Tennessee due to a range of restrictive trans-related bills, several of which have passed.Despite the dozens of proposals presented this year, so far only Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and South Dakota have pushed through measures banning trans women and girls from playing in female sports.Idaho passed a similar law last year that has been blocked by federal court.Last month, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a Republican, vetoed bills in their states that aim to restrict trans athletes, with Kelly calling her state’s version of the bill “regressive”.Both chambers of Arkansas’s state legislature passed a measure that would have made the state the first in the country to criminally punish doctors for providing certain types of care to trans youth.Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, vetoed the bill shortly afterwards, saying it would be “vast government overreach”, however his veto was overturned by the legislature.But despite the reprieve in some states, more such bills are bound to become law - particularly if lawmakers do not fear repercussions for their local economies, Lieberman said.“Money, not morals, shifts the conversation far too often,” said Lieberman.","['lieberman', 'far', 'ready', 'state', 'bills', 'firms', 'lgbt', 'voice', 'legislation', 'rights', 'trans', 'concerns', 'states', 'companies', 'analysisare']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

Probably won't know until the fall - Reuters,"* Some younger workers are finding jobs in new fields, shrinking the labor pool for the industries they left behind.* Many employers need to fill jobs requiring skills that sidelined workers may not have.Economists say that if employers need workers so badly, they would raise pay.It is not unusual for it to take time for labor markets upended by a recession to work out kinks.After the last downturn, Fed surveys showed employers grousing about worker shortages in 2012, when the unemployment rate was above 8%.","Matt Dillion and Chad Damron weld an upper deck assembly at Look Trailers cargo trailer manufacturing facility in Middlebury, Indiana, U.S., April 1, 2021. REUTERS/Eileen T. Meslar(This May 6 story corrects name in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27, to Drew Hall, not Richard Bunce)As the economy revs up to meet the rapacious demand of tens of millions of newly vaccinated Americans, employers say they cannot fill their yawning need for labor.Take Alex Washut. In January he mapped out hiring plans for his two breakfast and lunch eateries in western Massachusetts and figured he'd need to hire 20 new cooks, servers, dishwashers and other staff by May. He has doubled wages in some cases but has managed to hire only five; most of the time, he said, job candidates never even show for their interviews.At the same time, the U.S. economy is down more than 8 million jobs since before the pandemic, and Federal Reserve officials say the true unemployment rate is closer to 10% than the 5.8% a government report is expected to show on Friday.Analysts estimate U.S. employers added nearly a million new jobs last month, but the question is not why U.S. employers hired so many, but why they did not hire more?What gives? It's a long list, but here are some of the highlights:* Parents - particularly mothers - cannot work because closures or shortened hours at schools and daycare keep them home to watch their kids. read more* Would-be workers remain concerned about health risks amid a pandemic still claiming about 700 American lives daily.* Stock market gains have given some older workers the cushion to retire.* Some younger workers are finding jobs in new fields, shrinking the labor pool for the industries they left behind.* Many employers need to fill jobs requiring skills that sidelined workers may not have.* Employers complain that enhanced unemployment benefits and other government aid are keeping workers on the sidelines, content to collect a check rather than work for a living. Data released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed more than 16 million people are still receiving some form of unemployment benefit, now more than a year into the pandemic. read more""We recognize that the labor supply has been affected by the pandemic... (but) are seeing little evidence though that enhanced unemployment benefits are currently affecting Americans' willingness to work,"" Whitehouse spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday.What's that all add up to? In a nutshell, this: A National Federation of Independent Business survey showed a record 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill in March.Economists say that if employers need workers so badly, they would raise pay. So far, that's not happening. U.S. compensation rose more quickly than expected in the first quarter, but the boost came mostly from one-time bonuses to financial sector workers, and was not broadly shared.""The full sentence is 'I can't find workers at the wage I am willing to offer.' Full stop,"" said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. ""You can find workers.""EYES ON SEPTEMBEROver the next several months analysts will watch intently to see how the labor market adapts to the biggest changes since after World War Two, when millions of soldiers returned home and wartime assembly lines shut down. It may be the end of summer before there is any real clarity.""Ultimately as we get into September and we see schools reopening and some decline in unemployment insurance benefits we do expect for a lot of these labor scarcity issues to be alleviated,"" Deutsche Bank economist Matthew Luzzetti said.Or, as Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester put it on Wednesday, as vaccinations rise and more schools return to in-person learning, ""We'll get to that better equilibrium in the labor market between supply and demand.""It is not unusual for it to take time for labor markets upended by a recession to work out kinks.After the last downturn, Fed surveys showed employers grousing about worker shortages in 2012, when the unemployment rate was above 8%. When compensation began to rise in earnest several years later, workers flooded back to the labor market.""What we saw was that labor supply generally showed up,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month. ""In other words, if you were worried about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did.""This time, with the economy projected to grow at its fastest pace since 1984, the rebalancing may be quicker. The Fed will be watching what happens with wages, and prices.BACK TO THE KITCHEN? NOPESome workers in industries hard hit by job losses, such as restaurants and retail, have moved sectors entirely, said Bill Spriggs, chief economist with the AFL-CIO and a professor at Howard University.Some people who had low-paying jobs before the pandemic were struggling to cover their bills even before the crisis and may be searching for more financial security, he said.Drew Hall, 33, was working as an executive chef in South Philadelphia when the pandemic hit. His eatery shut for six weeks, reopened for takeout, and then shut again.Laid off, Hall said he ""decided I needed to do something different."" He went to coding school, graduated in December and had a job offer two weeks later. He has since had a couple of offers to get back into the restaurant business. ""I don't plan on doing that,"" he said.Hall's gain is the restaurant industry's loss. Washington-based restaurant operator Knead Hospitality is so desperate for workers it is offering hiring bonuses of up to $1,000 for servers, line cooks and bartenders.Washut, the Massachusetts restaurateur, said he figures that to entice people collecting unemployment benefits he would have to set starting hourly pay at $19, up from $15 now. That would mean bumping wages even higher for existing staff or risk them feeling short-changed. To pay for all those raises, he would have to jack up prices on his $12 plates of Caribbean jerk chicken hash and eggs. ""And who will pay $20 for an order of hash?""Jimmy Nigg, who runs the Monkey Barrel Bar in Denver, is in a similar boat. He often finds himself in the kitchen making $5.95 cheeseburgers or behind the bar serving $6 craft beer because he can't find staff, though he now offers line cooks nearly $19 an hour.Still, he's betting the upward wage pressure is temporary.By September, he said, people will be willing to take “$15 or $16 because they are so desperate.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","['workers', 'pay', 'showed', 'mln', 'unemployment', 'jobs', 'pandemic', 'americans', 'employers', 'labor', 'need', 'filling', 'companies', 'work']",2021-05-06,,LCH SA

Germany is still at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and will have to live with it for a long time, the Chancellor said.Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservative alliance has seen its popularity ratings hit an all-time low, deepening an apparent shift in voter trends in Germany.Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union, saw their popularity fall to 23% in the latest voter poll conducted by Kantar for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.The survey of 1,910 Germans showed support for Merkel's CDU-CSU bloc had fallen yet again, from 24% the week before to hit the lowest ever level in the history of the weekly poll.Meanwhile, the Green Party remained in the lead with 26% of the vote, albeit with its rating also down 1 percentage point from the week before. In third place in the poll, with 16%, was the Social Democratic Party, the current junior coalition partner with the CDU-CSU.The center-left SPD announced Sunday that the current Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will lead its election campaign. So he will be facing the Greens' Annalena Baerbock and the center-right CDU-CSU's candidate Armin Laschet in the race to replace Merkel in September's vote.Greens' 'honeymoon' period?In a show of just how much voter trends are changing, the Green Party has gone from being a fringe movement to a contender to lead government. If current opinion polls are borne out in the election then it will lead Germany's government, very likely with a coalition partner or two.Deutsche Bank economists led by Stefan Schneider noted that when it comes to coalition options, ""nothing is impossible (at least arithmetically).""""The nominations of Annalena Baerbock and Armin Laschet as chancellor candidates have clearly helped the Greens to gain ground. They might not only be the kingmaker for the next government, but could now even appoint the next chancellor. The current shift in voters' sentiment allows for a whole bunch of coalition options,"" the economists said in a note Friday.Deutsche Bank's economists said they continue to attach a marginally higher probability to a black-green government (a CDU-CSU led coalition with the Greens) compared to a Greens-led traffic light coalition with the SPD and the Liberals (the FDP party). Only the right-wing AfD has been ruled out as a partner by all the others.""It remains to be seen whether the honeymoon of Mrs. Baerbock and the German voters will last until election day in September, as the green chancellor candidate now needs to explain to the voters how exactly she wants to achieve her policy proposals,"" they added.Covid crisisThe departure of Merkel after four terms in office is heralding a shift in German politics. But the coronavirus crisis might have also shaped a fall from grace for the CDU-CSU bloc over its handling of the pandemic — a challenge for any government.While Germany's initial handling of the public health crisis was praised — it managed to keep the initial spread relatively under control with a robust track and trace system and modern hospital infrastructure that kept deaths low — it has faltered as a third wave of infections swept through Europe earlier this year.In addition, the country's vaccination drive has been sluggish. Only 9.7% of Germany's adult population has received two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, with 34.3% having received at least one dose of a shot, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. France, Spain and Italy have all given two doses to a higher number of people, ECDC data shows.From Sunday, Germany has loosened restrictions for vaccinated individuals or those that have recovered from a recent Covid-19 illness, meaning that social-contact rules, quarantining following travel and a nighttime curfew no longer apply to those individuals.To date, Germany has recorded over 3.5 million infections and 84,844 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.","['germany', 'polls', 'voter', 'shift', 'union', 'historic', 'bloc', 'lead', 'start', 'rules', 'low', 'chancellor', 'current', 'hits', 'merkels', 'loosen', 'coalition', 'covid', 'party', 'popularity']",2021-05-10,,LCH SA
