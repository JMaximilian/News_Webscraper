BNP Paribas,1,centralbanking.com,https://www.centralbanking.com/awards/7796691/asset-manager-bnp-paribas-asset-management,2021-03-15,Asset manager: BNP Paribas Asset Management,"BNP Paribas Asset Management has reinforced its position as one of the leading institutions serving reserve managers worldwide during the past year. Its official institutions group has nurtured long-term relationships, offering a suite of services tailored to address both new and old challenges facing central banks. Yet a common root for its solid growth traces back to the relationships created by Fischer, Francis, Trees & Watts (FFT&W), the US investment management firm BNP Paribas acquired in 2006.

The acquisition bestowed BNP Paribas with improved expertise on mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a key alternative asset class for central banks seeking to reap higher yields while limiting their risk exposures. The ability to secure returns while managing the complex risks of the MBS market attracted international clients that remain attached to BNP Paribas to this day. Added to this is a strong focus on training – an offering the asset manager has been quick to adapt to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, developing new online options.

The asset manager is also committed to educating central banks about the opportunities offered by environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment, offering a path to adopt these principles in the management of foreign exchange portfolios. This has contributed to boosting assets under management, resulting in BNP Paribas Asset Management being a top-five central bank asset manager by the end of 2019, according to Pension & Investments.

Work with the Czech National Bank showcases the way BNP Paribas has served the central banking community over the past few decades.

“Our relationship goes a long time back, to the 1990s, when we worked with FFT&W,” says Jan Schmidt, executive director of risk management at the CNB. Both parties reinforced their link in November 2019 with a new $500 million MBS mandate. However, securing it was far from a foregone conclusion for the French group. The selection process was highly competitive. In total, more than a dozen asset managers competed for four mandates of the same size, among them major US firms. Schmidt says the investments ran by BNP Paribas were well-managed during the liquidity squeeze in March 2020.

Tailor-made for central banks

“It has been more than a year since the mandate was put in place, and BNP Paribas Asset Management has proved its top position when it comes to delivering both the financial performance and also fulfilling its other commitments in our contract,” says Schmidt.

Beyond a competitive return performance, one key advantage highlighted by BNP Paribas’s clients is its flexibility to address specific requests.

“In this MBS mandate, we required the asset manager to provide us with customised reporting. We asked them to directly connect our accounting system with them,” says Schmidt.

“We spent almost a year working on the reporting lines, and BNP Paribas was the first out of these four managers to establish the reporting line, exactly according to what we required during the tender.”

BNP Paribas Asset Management has proved its top position when it comes to delivering both the financial performance and also fulfilling its other commitments in our contract Jan Schmidt, Czech National Bank

This ability to cater to central banks’ specific needs stems from the group having official institutions embedded in its DNA, says the head of reserve management at a central bank with assets exceeding $250 billion.

“One indication of this is that the CEO of BNP Paribas Asset Management USA, Johanna Lasker, is also the head of official institutions,” the official tells Central Banking. “That really shows you the thinking and the sensitivity to official institutions.”

Other asset managers tend to serve their central bank clients through their in-country delegation.

“These departments serve several pension funds, maybe a sovereign wealth fund, but just one central bank. If, instead, you have an official institutions group such as BNP Paribas, which serves dozens of institutions like ours around the world, they are really aware of our needs as a central bank,” says the reserve manager at the central bank with assets of more than $250 billion.

“Sometimes, training might be helpful. On other occasions, you just need a staff member to come over and address a specific problem. They’re willing to show you what to do to get you educated.”

BNP Paribas’s commitment to the community is not only limited to larger, more profitable institutions. Take the Central Bank of Aruba, an institution serving a Dutch island in the Caribbean with barely more than 100,000 people. The initial connection between the two parties also stems from FFT&W, a relationship that has slowly thrived until now becoming full-fledged partners.

“Even when they weren’t our official asset managers, they still came to the bank and made presentations,” says the president of the Central Bank of Aruba, Jeanette Semeleer.

“When we needed advice, we could count on them – so this relationship started on a non-formal basis a long time ago. I must say they invested time in it.”

Now, the French institution manages a fixed income mandate in US dollars with a short duration of one to two years for the Caribbean central bank. It is a demanding portfolio that includes an income target with restrictive risk parameters. Managing public, scarce, key financial resources for the island, BNP Paribas constantly needs to balance returns and capital preservation with little margin for error.

Partly due to the low-yield environment that followed the financial crisis, the Caribbean central bank has invested in staff specialised in risk management over the past few years. This has allowed it to better communicate its risk guidelines to BNP Paribas, and securely reap higher returns by adding corporate bonds to its portfolio. In November 2020, the central bank’s reserve portfolio stood at almost Afl1.9 billion ($1.1 billion) in foreign exchange assets, according to official data. This was up from Afl1.4 billion in 2016.

“For us, it’s very important to trust these people – trust their knowledge and their judgement. Although we are a small central bank, we demand timely reports and they comply,” says Semeleer.

“They’re an extension of our operations, and we have very high standards in terms of risk management. So far, they have been able to comply, not only in terms of managing the risk and our risk appetite and understanding our needs, but also working within our budget.”

The track record BNP Paribas has built over the years also allowed it to weather the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the challenging environment, it was able to on-board new central bank mandates and work closely with central banks that were making significant asset allocation changes while working remotely.

During this challenging year, “clients demonstrated great flexibility and continued to make changes to their asset allocation by introducing new sectors to their reserve management programmes”, Lasker tells Central Banking.

Sustainable investment

BNP Paribas has also taken a leadership role in its approach towards sustainable investment after publishing its global sustainability strategy in 2019. This encompasses ESG integration and plenty of proprietary research.

“We rate and score more than 12,000 corporate issuers on ESG performance, and we also have an ESG scoring framework on sovereigns,” says Jane Ambachtsheer, global head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

“We have an aim to beat the benchmark on both ESG and carbon for those strategies that have an investable benchmark, and are in the process of integrating this into our client reporting.”

The reserve manager at the central bank with assets exceeding $250 billion says the French asset manager “has a huge database of companies on ESG compliance”, and adds: “Currently, we don’t have an ESG mandate with them, but the way they report to us on this field is very sophisticated.”

As with other investment areas, these ESG capabilities are tailored to every central bank client. The Central Bank of Aruba – based in a jurisdiction highly exposed to climate-change risks – is currently formulating its new strategy in this area, including climate-change policies and the greening of its investment portfolios.

“BNP Paribas has worked very closely with our team to help us understand the possibilities at our disposal,” says the central bank’s Semeleer. “It’s not easy, because we still need to maximise our investments. We need to carve out a green policy that would allow us to still make some money.”

As the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe and the US, it set off a liquidity crisis that could have spiralled out of control. While central banks acted as liquidity providers of last resort, some of their commercial counterparts also stepped up to offer critical market-making and other services to assist official-sector clients.

Joe Squires, BNP

The corporate and institutional banking unit of BNP Paribas drew particular praise from central bank clients across a wide range of geographic regions and business areas – notably in fixed income, cash and repo products, foreign exchange trading and gold swaps – during this time of heightened market tension.

BNP Paribas kept making markets through the heat of the Covid-19 crisis, and was “willing to deploy” its balance sheet, according to Joe Squires, co-head of G10 rates for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Emea). To take one example, the bank’s repo and securities lending activity with central banks in Europe saw a 30% increase in volume. One central bank client describes BNP Paribas as an “important partner” for securities lending services.

Its commitment to the sector is no accident. BNP Paribas has spent decades building its relationships with central banks. It set up a dedicated official institutions coverage team, which now comprises 25 staff, 15 years ago. Laurent Leveque, global head of official institutions coverage, says the team has strong support from senior managers, including chairman Jean Lemierre (the former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). BNP Paribas now works with 90 central banks, and counts more than 250 institutions among its official-sector clients, Leveque tells Central Banking.

All that glistens …

One area where BNP Paribas particularly shone during the Covid-19 crisis was gold. “We continued to provide significant liquidity to our official-sector counterparties to help them manage maturing transactions on gold swaps, with gold often delivered back to us due to market conditions, and we provided the liquidity needed, without disruption, in the London and Zurich markets in particular,” explains Davide Collini, head of Emea metals.

A reserve manager at a major central bank in Europe says his institution was able to benefit from these favourable market conditions. Working with BNP Paribas, the central bank conducted many gold market operations during March and April, taking advantage of gold market conditions and huge demand for dollar liquidity worldwide to generate additional returns.

BNP Paribas is historically one of our best market counterparts Reserve manager at a major central bank in Europe

The central banker adds that BNP Paribas has also worked with his team on a new gold project, although the details currently remain under wraps. “BNP Paribas is historically one of our best market counterparts,” says the reserve official.

Bond markets have been central in terms of central bank responses to the crisis in 2020, and here, too, BNP Paribas was well-positioned. It has been an active participant in the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), and has also been a leader when it comes to supporting governments with their Covid financing. As well as holding 25 primary dealerships worldwide, the bank was ranked top for its work on structuring Covid-related bond issuances in the year to September 2020, according to data from Dealogic.

Delphine Queniart, BNP

Green finance is another area of strength for the French bank – and a topic that is rapidly growing in importance for central banks worldwide. BNP Paribas was involved in structuring several innovative bond issuances, and has helped central banks to invest during the past few years, says Delphine Queniart, global head of sustainable finance. An example was the three-year sustainable development bond issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in June – central banks ultimately bought 76% of the 3 billion renminbi ($460 million) issuance.

BNP Paribas also participated in the issuance of the European Union’s Sure (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) instrument, comprising €100 billion ($121 billion) of loans from the EU to member states struggling with the effects of the pandemic. Central banks bought 37% of the 10-year tranche, says Queniart: “This is the result of intensive work from all our teams to support the European Union in this landmark transaction.”

The preparatory work and commitment to the official sector has helped bolster income. The bank’s global markets revenues rose 63.5% year on year in the second quarter of 2020, with fixed income, currencies and commodity revenues up 154%, reflecting frantic bond issuance by sovereigns to fund measures to combat the health crisis, as well as rapid reallocations in the portfolios of institutional clients, including major central banks.

Laurent Leveque, BNP

BNP Paribas also has a trusted research role in green finance and on other matters relating to investment. It advises major central banks on green finance, and Queniart says the goal is to play a “leadership” role in scaling up sustainable finance markets. On broader research, one of the firm’s clients says there is a “very good relationship” between Leveque’s team and reserve managers.

The French bank has also grown its share in US markets and elsewhere, while remaining a top counterparty for euro activities. A European central banker points to a new, securities lending mandate denominated in US dollars that was awarded to BNP Paribas in the past year, adding that the French dealer is one of the central bank’s “more active” counterparties in both dollars and euros. The official notes that BNP Paribas also offers renminbi services, unlike many other counterparties.

BNP Paribas is committed to offering services to central bank clients across the ‘full value chain’ of global markets, from trading to finance, in addition to asset management and securities services. Its credentials underwent a tough real-world stress test in the past year, and the bank ultimately delivered on its promise to stand by central banks throughout the turbulence.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold."" Read more: What Happens When Tycoons Abandon Their Own Giant Cargo ShipsThe industry says it is the responsibility of ship owners to arrange crew changes and to ensure the safety and well-being of the seafarers on their vessels. BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.

When Yann Gérardin was toiling away on the fringes of the dealing room at pre-merger Banque Nationale de Paris, putting together an equity derivatives desk in the late 1980s, the prospect of being able to deploy a full-service equities franchise must have seemed far away. But now, as deputy chief operating officer of BNP Paribas and head of its corporate and institutional bank, he is about to preside over a radical change that he thinks will transform how the firm transacts with its equities clients.

In its full-year earnings for 2020, BNPP said it would “accelerate the development of its equity businesses with the roll-out of a broader prime services offering and the strengthening of cooperation with Exane BNP Paribas”. Now the bank has revealed just what that means. On March 11 it announced that it would buy out the half of its equities partnership with Exane that it does not already own for an undisclosed sum.

In doing so the bank is bringing to an end an arrangement that was first mooted in late 2003 and formally launched in April 2004. But the move also marks a vote of confidence by the bank in its ability to make a full-service equities franchise work at a time when European investment banks are struggling to justify the effort involved.

Citigroup Inc. C, -1.53% , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -2.30% , Bank of America Corp. BAC, -2.78% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -1.82% were among the many large U.S. companies to make public statements of support in response to widespread protests last summer after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. In recent days, they have all officially opposed shareholder groups’ calls for them to conduct and publicize racial-equity audits and other changes, saying they are already doing enough to address equity issues.

The shareholder proposals urge the banks to examine their practices and policies and identify ways to “avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color,” something the banks says is unnecessary because they are juggling different, related initiatives and/or have committed money to such issues internally and externally. The proposals are included in proxy statements to shareholders, which allow for the companies to support or oppose shareholder resolutions and explain why ahead of a vote at their annual meetings.

CtW Investment Group wrote in its proposal to Citi shareholders that the bank “has a conflicted history when it comes to addressing racial injustice within the communities it serves.” The group provides examples, including Citi getting fined by the Treasury Department in 2019 for failing to offer all customers mortgage discounts and credits; its required minimum maintenance fees and minimum daily balances; and the fact that it has only one Black executive in the C-suite (Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason).

“While we disagree with the overall approach in this proposal, we are completely aligned with its stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the financial sector,” Citi said in its proxy filed Wednesday.

The bank pointed to its $1 billion commitment to providing greater access to banking and mortgages for communities of color, plus making investments in Black businesses. It also said, “As recently as September 2020, Citi released a 104-page report on the economic cost of Black inequality in the United States titled ‘Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps,'” and said its efforts on these issues are available to the public.

Citi is also recommending shareholders vote no on a couple of other racial equity-related resolutions, such as adopting a “Rooney Rule” policy to increase diversity in its board of directors and disclosing its direct and indirect lobbying activities in a report.

CtW also mentioned minimum requirements for deposits and fees in its Bank of America resolution, adding that the Treasury Department found in 2018 that the bank offered proportionately fewer home loans to minorities than white applicants in Philadelphia, and that BofA’s C-suite is just 8% Black.

Bank of America said in its proxy released last week that it has committed $1 billion to supporting minority-owned businesses, jobs initiatives in Black and Hispanic communities, affordable housing and donations to historically Black colleges and universities and more. It also touted its work with “consumer advocates in the design and marketing of our financial services and products” and its efforts to diversify its workplace and leadership.

In its proposal at Wells Fargo, the Service Employees International Union Pension Plans Master Trust mentions the bank’s record of discriminatory lending practices that have led to different lawsuits and a settlement with the Department of Justice in 2012, as well as settlements of employment-discrimination claims.

Wells Fargo, which released its proxy Tuesday, said it is conducting a “human rights impact assessment,” and that it will release a summary of those results and the actions it plans to take in response. The company also said it is making efforts toward diversity, equity and inclusion in its workplace and among its top ranks.

The SEIU put forth a similar proposal at Goldman Sachs. It said that despite Goldman’s stated commitment to a diverse workforce, a Black managing director’s internal email calling for the company to do better went viral last year. In addition, the proposal mentions that the investment banking company “underwrites municipal bonds whose proceeds pay police brutality settlements. For example, Goldman was lead underwriter for a 2017 Chicago offering that allocated $225 million for settlements and judgments.”

In its proxy released Friday, Goldman Sachs recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution, saying it has taken additional steps toward racial equity in the past year, including “assessing [its] shortcomings” and committing to hiring more analysts from HBCUs.

It also pointed to its $10 million pledge to give to racial-justice organizations last year, plus hundreds of millions of dollars it has committed to grants and investments in minority businesses over the years.

Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW, worked with the SEIU on the shareholder proposals. While he said he “welcomed” the banks’ pledges on racial equality and justice issues, “as investors, we believe a critical part of this work is an independent assessment of the effectiveness of these promises.”

The shareholder groups also had pointed out that the banks’ political and charitable donations have contradicted their stated commitments to justice and equity.

Wells Fargo “has donated to Senator Tom Cotton, who called for military air strikes on Black Lives Matter protests, as well as other members of Congress with racist records,” the SEIU shareholder resolution says.

CtW said “Citi donated $242,000 during the 2020 election cycle to 74 members of Congress who are rated ‘F’ by the NAACP,” and that Bank of America has been involved in issuing “judgment obligation bonds, a portion of which was used to pay for police related settlements” in Los Angeles.

Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman have donated to police departments that “bypass normal procurement processes to buy equipment for police departments, including surveillance technology that has been used to target communities of color and nonviolent protestors,” the shareholder resolutions say.

Morgan Stanley MS, -1.31% and JP Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -2.76% are facing similar shareholder proposals, and have yet to release their proxies. This article will be updated when they do.

“We’ve seen greater appetite from family offices and other sophisticated high-net-worth investors looking to gain entry into SPACs and other traditionally institutional investment-banking products,” Dickson said. “Tightening the synergies between our BCMA and private-bank platform makes sense.”

Citigroup’s private bank already caters to 1,400 family offices in more than 100 countries, along with a quarter of the world’s billionaires.

Newly minted Chief Executive Jane Fraser has been seeking to ensure her bank’s many different business lines work together more. In January the lender announced it would combine wealth-management and private-bank offerings.

When Citigroup first inked the joint venture between its investment bank and the private bank last year, it also crafted a revenue-sharing agreement to entice the two groups to collaborate.

Business that a private banker brings to the investment-banking group will result in the private bank receiving a referral fee equal to one-quarter of the immediate revenue from the transaction. Similarly, the investment bank will receive 25% of the revenue earned over three years from a relationship it brings to the private bank.

“Both BCMA and Citi Private Bank remain united in their belief that there are many great opportunities out there to cross-sell, to seek out opportunities together,” Dickson and Falco said in the memo this week. “So take this opportunity to call your contacts.”","“We’ve seen greater appetite from family offices and other sophisticated high-net-worth investors looking to gain entry into SPACs and other traditionally institutional investment-banking products,” Dickson said.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold."" Read more: What Happens When Tycoons Abandon Their Own Giant Cargo ShipsThe industry says it is the responsibility of ship owners to arrange crew changes and to ensure the safety and well-being of the seafarers on their vessels. BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.

Mar 22, 2021 (Stock Traders Daily via COMTEX) -- Some people say that timing does not matter, but it does. If you were to buy Citigroup (NYSE: C) at a high, see it fall, and not be able to buy more on the dip like the big boys can, that would be troubling. Over time, Stock Traders Daily has found a way to lessen the odds of this happening. Below, we provide data for C that can be used to help achieve this goal. The data can be used to improve the timing of buy and sell decisions. This data was current at the time of publication, but it is not updated in real time here.

The data is best used in conjunction with our Market Analysis and Stock Correlation Filters too, because those help us go with the flow of the market as well. Going with the flow is extremely important, so review our Market Analysis with this C Report. C - (Long) Support Plan The technical summary data tells us to buy C near 69.65, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 69.45 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 69.65 is the first level of support below 72.37, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 69.65 is being tested, a buy signal would exist. C - (Short) Resistance Plan NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

Nomura analysts Tushar Mohata and Alpa Aggarwal revised their estimates downwards in a research note published early Wednesday morning in which they pointed to the fact that Genting Malaysia’s UK properties will remain closed until at least 17 May under the government’s reopening schedule, and predicted ongoing losses for Resorts World Bimini in the Bahamas and Resorts World Catskills in New York.

They also noted that earnings at flagship Malaysia property Resorts World Genting will be impacted in 1Q21 by its recent one month closure and could be impacted further pending the country’s ever-changing COVID situation. 2Q21 earnings should improve, however, led by vaccination progress.

Nevertheless, Mohata and Aggarwal have revised down their 2021 estimates by 10% with revenue now forecast at around MYR6.32 billion (US$1.54 billion), down from an earlier estimate of MYR7.05 billion (US$1.71 billion). An estimated profit of MYR286 million (US$70 million) has also been revised down to MYR184 million.

More positive is the impending mid-2021 launch of RWG’s Skyworlds theme park, with Nomura noting that the hiring of staff is now well underway.

“We believe investors will overlook near-term bumpy earnings and are looking through to FY22F prospects, which look promising for Malaysia with the Skyworlds theme park scheduled to open,” the analysts said.

“We believe that 1Q21 earnings from Malaysian operations will be impacted due to ~1 month closure of the resort due to the movement control order. However, given the reopening since then, and progressive ramp-up of vaccination, revenue/EBITDA momentum should improve thereafter, in our view.

“There remains a possibility that any future wave of COVID-19 infections might impact visitation again later in 2021, but the risks of this happening will dissipate as vaccination ramps up in 2H21.”

Nomura has maintained a Buy rating on Genting Malaysia shares, with a target price of MYR3.80 suggesting 21% upside to the current price of MYR3.30.","Nomura Research has cut its earnings estimates for Genting Malaysia by 10% for 2021, with the Malaysian IR operators now tipped to make a loss of around MYR184 million (US$45 million) due to ongoing COVID-19 related closures.

Nomura,3,siliconera.com,https://www.siliconera.com/nomura-says-ffvii-the-first-soldier-will-appeal-to-other-fanbases/,2021-03-17,Nomura Says FFVII The First Soldier Will Appeal to Other Fanbases,"During an interview with Famitsu, Tetsuya Nomura confirmed new details about the upcoming mobile game, Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier. The title’s creative director talked about its ambitions, gameplay, and even revealed that there will be a job system. We have translated a summary of the interview below.

Square Enix announced the new game in the Final Fantasy VII universe in February 2021 would be a battle royale title for mobile devices. Set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII proper, Nomura confirmed that The First Soldier will affect the story of another upcoming mobile title, Final Fantasy Ever Crisis.

Famitsu started the interview by asking the Nomura who the target audience is with Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier. He responded,

“Fanbases of long-standing IPs—not just Final Fantasy VII—become static to a degree. So our challenge is to appeal to other fanbases.”

Nomura also said he feels strongly that the team cannot rest on the laurels of Final Fantasy VII‘s legacy. So they are developing Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier intending to get into the most popular game genre at the moment. He hopes the Battle Royale title will be a catalyst for those unfamiliar with the Final Fantasy series to get interested in the expanded universe of Final Fantasy VII.

In terms of game systems, Nomura confirmed new details based on the footage we’ve seen so far. He stated that Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier will likely have a job system called “Styles.” (Please note that this phrase could change in the official localization.) The icons on the screen indicate what special skills the player can use based on their Style, which they can change for each battle. Additionally, Nomura confirmed that there will be a closed beta test, with details coming in the future.

When asked about what the team is focusing on, Nomura brought up gameplay and stated the importance of game-feel and balancing. In this regard, Nomura said that Producer Shoichi Ichikawa is a hardcore battle royale player, so his feedback has been very helpful. When Nomura introduces an idea, Ichikawa can tell him how it will affect the title’s balance and openly inform Nomura when he’s “spouting nonsense.” Additionally, Nomura said the team is polishing up the game’s visuals so it doesn’t disappoint anyone for being a mobile title.

Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier will release on iOS and Android devices in 2021.","During an interview with Famitsu, Tetsuya Nomura confirmed new details about the upcoming mobile game, Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier.

The Nomura India Business Resumption Index dipped to 95.1 for the week to March 21 from 95.4 in the previous week as a result of the rising infections, the brokerage said.

COVID-19 infections are rising to new heights across the country and many local governments have been forced to re-introduce stricter measures like night-time curfews and sealing off premises in order to contain the spread.

“The pandemic's second wave is now spreading to states outside Maharashtra and is starting to impact mobility. This suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization,"" it said.

The brokerage added that it expects the impact to be “more transitory and muted"", as factory operations remain uninterrupted, consumers and businesses have adapted to the new normal and medium-term tailwinds like vaccinations, global growth, easy financial conditions continue.

It said as of mid-March, Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility fell by 3.7 percentage points on a week-on-week basis and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while the more updated Apple driving index fell by 2.6 percentage points.

However, power demand improved by 2.6 per cent week-on-week after a 0.6 per cent decline the prior week, while the labour participation rate inched up to 40.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent.

The knock-on effect of the second wave on mobility suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization, it said.

The medium-term tailwinds from the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, fiscal activism, strong global growth and continuing vaccine momentum will support real GDP growth of 13.5 per cent in FY22, up from a contraction of 7.4 per cent in FY21, it said. PTI AA ANU ANU

Nomura,3,ggrasia.com,http://www.ggrasia.com/gen-malaysia-further-inputs-to-empire-possible-nomura/,2021-03-22,GGRAsia – GEN Malaysia further inputs to Empire possible: Nomura,"GEN Malaysia further inputs to Empire possible: Nomura

Nomura banking group says there is “limited room” in the near term for casino investor Genting Malaysia Bhd to realise “further capital injections” into Empire Resorts Inc, an associated that runs Resorts World Catskills (pictured), in upstate New York in the United States. But a further capital injection could be done after September, without the need for a minority shareholder vote, added the institution.

Genting Malaysia Bhd said in a Friday filing it had agreed to subscribe for up to US$20 million of “Series L” preferred stock in Empire Resorts. The latter company became in 2019 an associate of Genting Malaysia and vehicles held by Genting’s controlling Malaysian dynasty, the Lim family.

Nomura suggested in a Monday note that related-party transactions – such as the Empire Resorts capital injection – “above an aggregate value of 5 percent of net book value of Genting Malaysia, done cumulatively over a rolling 12-month period, will need a minority shareholder vote.”

The brokerage stated that due to the “lower book value” of Genting Malaysia after fiscal-year 2020 losses, “the aggregate of Empire capital injections (in September 2020 and March 2021) now amounts to 4.8 percent” of the casino operator’s book value.

That suggested “limited room for further capital injections in the near term till September 2021, unless shareholder approval is sought,” wrote analysts Tushar Mohata and Alpa Aggarwal.

Genting Malaysia – promoter of Resorts World Genting, Malaysia’s only licensed casino complex – said in its Friday filing that the proceeds from the subscription to Empire Resorts’ stock would be used to “close Empire’s short-term refinancing plan for its debts totalling US$350 million, maturing on 23 March 2021”.

In Monday’s memo, Nomura said it believed Empire Resorts would “attempt to conclude the refinancing” of Resorts World Catskills’ long-term borrowings “in the meantime, as its operating outlook improves with progress in U.S. vaccination” programmes.

“Should there be a delay in refinancing till September 2021, there can theoretically be a further US$140 million capital injection in Empire by Genting Malaysia some time around October 2021, based on our calculations, without seeking a minority vote,” added the Nomura team.

It added: “It is imperative, in our view, that Empire secures financing soon at attractive interest rates if it is to turn profitable, lest Genting Malaysia have to shoulder further recapitalisation.”

The Resorts World Genting casino complex – Genting Malaysia’s main revenue generator – resumed operations on February 16, after being closed for more than three weeks as a Covid-19 countermeasure, due to a spike in infections in Malaysia.","GEN Malaysia further inputs to Empire possible: NomuraNomura banking group says there is “limited room” in the near term for casino investor Genting Malaysia Bhd to realise “further capital injections” into Empire Resorts Inc, an associated that runs Resorts World Catskills (pictured), in upstate New York in the United States.

Nomura,3,ptleader.com,"https://www.ptleader.com/stories/port-changes-lease-with-skookum-for-nomura-building,74259",2021-03-19,Port changes lease with Skookum for Nomura Building,"Posted Thursday, March 18, 2021 9:35 am

Port of Port Townsend Commissioners voted to terminate a lease with Skookum Educational Programs and authorized port officials to seek a replacement lease which would allow the port to rent out other portions of the building that are currently occupied by Skookum.

Port Commissioners Bill Putney, Pam Petranek and Pete Hanke all expressed their reticence in voting for the resolution.

“I’ve had some fairly extensive conversations with Eron [Berg] and Eric [Toews],” Putney said at the March 10 meeting. “While I feel it is not necessarily ideal, it is a good, supportable compromise position.”

“I agree, I feel the same way, Bill,” Petranek added. “It’s a good compromise.”

The change to the lease comes after the port entered into a 30-year building lease with the group in 1995.

As part of the lease, rent was set at $3,400 per month, but included a provision that allowed for the port to receive landscaping maintenance, litter removal, bulk mailing and other services from the company in lieu of cash payments for the rent.

In 2018, port staff brought the issue to the attention of the Washington State Auditor’s Office, which later issued a letter recommending that the port improve controls to ensure it is adequately compensated for leased properties.

As part of the new lease, Skookum will now occupy 2,139 square feet on the ground floor. This is a significant reduction from using the overall footprint of about 8,600 square feet.

Under the new lease, for the first five years Skookum will pay 25 percent of the market rate for the space, with a 2.5 percent annual escalator. Starting

April 1, 2021, Skookum will pay $892.69, escalating to $985.34 through March 31, 2026.

If Skookum wishes to extend the lease for an additional five-year term, it will be paying $2,019.94 per month in 2027, rising to $3,428.14 by 2031.

Port officials noted that early termination of the lease and its potential replacement would bring the port in line with recommendations made by the state auditor.

The port is currently in the process of working with the Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding to rent building space on the eastern half of the ground floor of the building.

The Port of Port Townsend estimates there will be a $5,000 price tag for worker time and materials to partition the building for its future tenants.","Posted Thursday, March 18, 2021 9:35 amPort of Port Townsend Commissioners voted to terminate a lease with Skookum Educational Programs and authorized port officials to seek a replacement lease which would allow the port to rent out other portions of the building that are currently occupied by Skookum.

The Nomura India Business Resumption Index dipped to 95.1 for the week to March 21 from 95.4 in the previous week as a result of the rising infections, the brokerage said.

COVID-19 infections are rising to new heights across the country and many local governments have been forced to re-introduce stricter measures like night-time curfews and sealing off premises in order to contain the spread.

“The pandemic's second wave is now spreading to states outside Maharashtra and is starting to impact mobility. This suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization,"" it said.

The brokerage added that it expects the impact to be “more transitory and muted"", as factory operations remain uninterrupted, consumers and businesses have adapted to the new normal and medium-term tailwinds like vaccinations, global growth, easy financial conditions continue.

It said as of mid-March, Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility fell by 3.7 percentage points on a week-on-week basis and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while the more updated Apple driving index fell by 2.6 percentage points.

However, power demand improved by 2.6 per cent week-on-week after a 0.6 per cent decline the prior week, while the labour participation rate inched up to 40.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent.

The knock-on effect of the second wave on mobility suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization, it said.

The medium-term tailwinds from the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, fiscal activism, strong global growth and continuing vaccine momentum will support real GDP growth of 13.5 per cent in FY22, up from a contraction of 7.4 per cent in FY21, it said. PTI AA ANU ANU

One of the largest U.S. investment banks, Morgan Stanley, will be offering its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America’s wealth management divisions do not currently allow their advisors to offer direct investment in bitcoin funds.

Morgan Stanley to Offer Wealth Clients Access to Bitcoin Funds

Investment bank Morgan Stanley, with $4 trillion in client assets, has become the “first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds,” CNBC reported Wednesday.

The firm reportedly told its financial advisors in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that allow exposure to bitcoin, the publication conveyed, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. According to the people, clients have been demanding exposure to the cryptocurrency, adding:

Clients can likely make investments as early as next month, after the bank’s financial advisors complete training courses tied to the new offerings.

Two of the bitcoin funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital: the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund LP and the Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP. The third is FS NYDIG Select Fund, a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG). The latter is the bitcoin investment arm of Stone Ridge Asset Management. Two of the funds have minimum investments of $25,000, but Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has a $5 million minimum.

The funds are only available to clients of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division and investments are restricted to 2.5% of the client’s total net worth, the sources revealed. Clients must have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm with “an aggressive risk tolerance” to qualify, whereas investment firms need at least $5 million at the bank.

The wealth management divisions of other major U.S. investment banks — Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America — do not currently allow their advisors to offer direct investment in bitcoin funds, the news outlet noted.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and NYDIG both tweeted that they are thrilled “to partner with Morgan Stanley, the first US bank to offer access to bitcoin for their wealth management clients.”

Bitcoiners welcome this move by Morgan Stanley, praising the investment bank for its contribution in making bitcoin more mainstream. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor wrote, “Morgan Stanley is the first bank to offer bitcoin, they won’t be the last.” Economist Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, commented: “Today is the day the big banks entered bitcoin.” Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano opined:

Galaxy Digital and NYDIG will both be onboarding millions of people to bitcoin via the largest US brokerage. Morgan Stanley is in the game. Bitcoin is inevitable.

Morgan Stanley will offer its wealth management clients access to Bitcoin exposure, according to a «CNBC» report citing an internal memo.

The decision was made due to client demand and investments into Bitcoin will be made available via three funds – two from Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital and one jointly from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin firm NYDIG.

Controlled Risk

Morgan Stanley’s wealth management arm, which has $4 trillion in client assets worldwide, will roll out the Bitcoin offering with an emphasis on risk management.

It considers exposure to the cryptocurrency suitable only for those with «aggressive risk tolerance» and at least $2 million in assets held by the American private bank. It is also limiting investments to as much as 2.5 percent of clients’ total net worth.

Morgan Stanley is the latest major American financier to officially enter the emerging market after BNY Mellon announced its new crypto custody offering for asset management clients last month.

In a note drafted by Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, as quoted by The Block, it reiterated that investment in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is speculative.

It did, however, reaffirm that while cryptocurrencies carry a lot of risk, it is currently maturing to a stage where it may become an ivnestible asset within a diverse portfolio.

“For speculative investment opportunities to rise to the level of an investable asset class that can play a role in diversified investment portfolios requires transformational progress on both the supply and demand sides.” It stated.

“With cryptocurrency, we think that threshold is being reached. A firming regulatory framework, deepening liquidity, availability of products and growing investor interest—especially among institutional investors—have coalesced.”

The note concluded by stating that cryptocurrency trading remains “in its infancy”, before stating that the bank is “yet to be convinced” and that it advises clients to proceed with caution.

Morgan Stanley owns more than 10% of MicroStrategy shares, which has been considered to be indirect exposure to Bitcoin in light of MicroStrategy’s close to 100,000 Bitcoin holdings.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe could be looking at another lost summer tourist season as COVID-19 cases are rising and the vaccine rollout has been so slow, threatening a major hit to the economies of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, Morgan Stanley said.

“Europe’s high cases and slow vaccine drive could lead to a late reopening, putting a second summer at risk – which would exacerbate the north-south divide and could trigger further policy easing,” Morgan Stanley said.

“Last year, without a vaccine, Europe was able to save some of its summer season with the help of restrictions and seasonal weather dynamics that lowered transmission rates from spring.

“But we are somewhat sceptical that this can happen again this year, given the emergence of new strains, which appear to be more transmissible and dangerous, and have driven an acceleration in cases recently in the euro area, e.g. in France and Italy.”","FILE PHOTO: People visit Porto Katsiki beach, following the easing of measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on the island of Lefkada, Greece, July 25, 2020.

In a research note issued Thursday, analysts Praveen Choudhary, Gareth Leung and Thomas Allen note that multiple circumstances will work in the favor of operators next year, with the number of hotel rooms in Macau’s gaming center of Cotai due to rise 13% thanks to openings at SJM’s Grand Lisboa Palace and Galaxy Entertainment Group’s Galaxy Macau Phase 3.

Notably, with Sands China’s The Londoner Macao focusing on quality over quantity, ultra-high-end hotel rooms will be up 59%, “delivering higher premium mass revenue,” Morgan Stanley said.

Rising revenues, driven by a 22% increase in China nominal GDP, will also be complemented by lower operating costs, estimated to remain 4% lower in 2022 than they were three years earlier. As a result, Morgan Stanley estimates Macau-wide Property EBITDA of US$11 billion in 2022 – 11% higher than market consensus and 15% higher than 2019.

“Macau will look and feel different in 2022 when compared to the pre-COVID world,” the analysts state.

Noting that Macau stocks are up 16% year to date, they add, “Investors are asking us ‘what is priced in’ and about the ‘shape of recovery.’ We recommend to focus beyond these to 2022, and how Macau looks so much different from the pre-COVID world.”","Rising hotel room capacity, growing demand and reduced costs will see Property EBITDA of Macau’s gaming operators increase 15% over 2019 levels in 2022, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley,4,coinspeaker.com,https://www.coinspeaker.com/morgan-stanley-stake-bithumb/,2021-03-19,Morgan Stanley Is Reportedly Interested in Buying Stake in Bithumb,"The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time.

New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is reportedly interested in acquiring shares in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. As reported by local media channel Aju news, the financial services behemoth is in talks with Bident, a major shareholder of Bithumb who has about a 10% ownership stake.

The decision to give up ownership stakes in Bithumb by its top shareholder, Lee Jung-hoon, takes precedence from the probe of authorities into the exchange’s financials, a situation that led to successive raids on the firms operating base by the South Korean Police in 2020. With Lee’s more than 40% stake up for grabs, various companies, both home and abroad had been making their intentions known.

One of the alleged early bidders, a South Korean-Japanese video game publisher Nexon Co Ltd (TYO: 3659) has refuted all media claims linking him to the acquisition deal, valued at $460 million. The intentions by Morgan Stanley according to the reports citing sources familiar with the matter are based on laying out an offer to Bident whose lower stake will prompt it to be open to favorable negotiations.

According to the reports, Morgan Stanley is pursuing only flexible options and is open to either helping Bident to increase its stake or to buy-out the firm’s holdings with a planned investment of between 300 and 500 billion Korean won ($254 million to $441 million).

“The reason Morgan Stanley used Bident is that it understood that Bident has the right to negotiate a preferred sale to acquire Bithumb Holdings,” said one of the anonymous sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Cointelegraph.

Morgan Stanley amid the Bithumb Push

The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time. The Bithumb exchange acquisition report is the sequel to the news break about the bank’s proposed product to give access to its rich clients to invest in and own Bitcoin directly through three Bitcoin funds.

While neither Morgan Stanley nor Bithumb has confirmed the show of interest from the former, the ownership bid is undoubtedly in line with the bank’s latest agenda to take the bull by the horn and help ride the cryptocurrency race on its journey to mainstream adoption.

The entire cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, with enough room for growth, and according to a recent report from German multinational investment bank and financial services company, Deutsche Bank AG (ETR: DBK), Bitcoin’s $1 trillion market capitalization has made it difficult to ignore the burgeoning asset class, and by extension, the host of other emerging altcoins out there.

The bid for Bithumb, per Market analyst Joseph Young, places the company at a $2 billion valuation.","The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time.

The New York-based bank donated $134,500 to federal candidates and fundraising committees for candidates in February, including Democratic chair of the House Financial Services Committee and anti-bank critic Maxine Waters, as well as her Republican counterpart Patrick McHenry.

No donation was made to any of the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying U.S. President Joe Biden's electoral votes, the Federal Election Commission filing showed on Friday.

Some Republican House members who voted to impeach former U.S. President Donald Trump, such as Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Anthony Gonzalez among others, did receive donations from the bank.

On Jan. 6, a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an attempt to overrun his defeat against Biden in the presidential elections, resulting in a riot with multiple deaths.

Morgan Stanley joined the ranks of numerous other companies on Jan. 10 to say it would halt its PAC donations and review them in the meantime.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold.""

BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards.

The report published Wednesday states that the price of bitcoin could continue to rise as long as it continues to attract entry from asset managers and companies.

However, the cryptocurrency is expected to remain volatile due to limited tradability.

Deutsche Bank estimates that less than 30% of transactional activity in bitcoin is related to payments. In 2020, for example, 28 million BTC changed hands, equivalent to 150% of the total bitcoin in circulation. Meanwhile, 40 billion Apple shares were exchanged, equating to 270% of the total.

Furthermore, the average number of BTC exchanged daily in U.S. dollars is equivalent to only 0.05% of yen and 0.06% of GBP that do so.

Therefore, bitcoin must transform potential into results, in the same way Tesla has done, according to Deutsche.

Tesla, like bitcoin, has sparked numerous debates about whether it is the future of the car or a “soon-to-die fad.” Sentiment has shifted dramatically in the last 18 months as Tesla proved itself able to deliver cars such as the Model 3 at scale.

Deutsche Bank believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has become an important asset, making it impossible to ignore it at this point. The leading cryptocurrency has gained more than 1000% since falling below the $4,000 mark in March 2020. It is currently trading close to the $60,000 mark and has a market cap above $1 trillion.

The rising market cap means that it can no longer be ignored. The bank is bullish about the cryptocurrency and sees its price soaring higher. In its report published on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said that Bitcoin’s price could continue to increase as it attracts entry from asset managers and companies.

Despite its bullish stance on cryptocurrency, Deutsche Bank is convinced that BTC will remain volatile due to its limited tradability. Although Bitcoin was created to be a medium of exchange, it has become more of an asset in recent years. Deutsche Bank revealed that less than 30% of transactional activity in BTC is related to payments. Thus, implying that most people hold the cryptocurrency as an asset.

Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it can challenge the traditional fiat system. The bank revealed that the average number of Bitcoin transactions in terms of US dollar daily is equivalent to only 0.05% of yen and 0.06% of GBP.

Deutsche Bank believes that the leading cryptocurrency’s current valuation makes it an excellent candidate to serve as a cross-border currency. However, it must show its value as a means of payment to live up to that reputation.

Major banks globally are slowly entering the crypto space and offering services to retail and institutional investors. Deutsche Bank doesn’t want to be left behind and plans to develop a fully integrated custody platform designed to cater to institutional clients and their digital assets.","The Deutsche Bank said that Bitcoin is too important to ignore at the moment, thanks to the cryptocurrency’s increasing market capDeutsche Bank believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has become an important asset, making it impossible to ignore it at this point.

The next few years might prove crucial for bitcoin (BTC) that is ""here to stay"" but is not likely to be used as a means of payment, according to German multinational giant Deutsche Bank.

Bitcoin’s market capitalization of more than USD 1trn “makes it too important to ignore,” while large players who buy and sell BTC have “considerable” market-moving power, said the March 2021 report prepared by Deutsche Bank Research. The coin’s price could continue to rise as long as asset managers and companies continue to enter the market.

So in the short term, bitcoin “is here to stay,” though its value will remain volatile due to its limited tradability, small tactical asset allocations, and the entries and exits of large asset managers. However, according to the authors of the report, in the long term, BTC will have to “transform [its] potential into results to sustain its value proposition.”

“The next two or three years should be a turning point for Bitcoin; consensus about its future may emerge as people monitor digital currency developments,” the researchers said.

For now, according to them, bitcoin’s current valuation is pricing in a shift toward cross-border digital currencies and the hypothesis is that BTC, as the leader, will benefit from network effects and become an important means of payment in the future.

The researchers argued that ""the race is fierce"" for cryptos to become a mainstream means of payment – BTC is an illiquid asset rarely used as a means of payment, while yet to be launched Facebook-backed Diem is focused on consumer adoption and real usage of money, it said. Furthermore, many countries have moved to create their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Therefore, in the medium to long run, because of strong network effects, it’s unlikely cryptos will be used as a widespread means of payment, said the report, adding:

“And as long as governments and central banks exist and hold the power to regulate money, there will be little room for bitcoin—as a means of payment—to replace traditional currencies.”

However, US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, said, citing a recent report from the Bank for International Settlements and a group of seven central banks, that a CBDC ""needs to coexist with cash and other types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system.""

In general, due to its volatility, most merchants don’t want to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Consumers might use providers to own/trade the asset – but mainly for investment, said the Deutsche Bank report.

It concluded that,

“But once we see some stability in the market, the use of crypto for the exchange of goods and services could normalize. Before that, the risks for both merchants and payment providers outweigh the benefits.”

The report also noted that since 2010, Bitcoin has been declared dead about 400 times, but the trend has been decreasing, and 2020 saw the fewest Bitcoin obituary predictions in 8 years.

And if governments were to back cryptocurrencies and consumers still want them, “adoption rates will drive the timeline for mainstream use.” Now we’re seeing the early days of blockchain wallet use, it said, but “if current trends continue, there could be 200 million blockchain wallet users in 2030.”

Among other conclusions, the bank said that:

There is little evidence of a direct correlation between the prices of bitcoin and gold, while the average daily volume and open interest of Bitcoin was only 1.9% and 2.8% of the volume and open interest of gold, respectively.

The USD currency index is usually inversely correlated with the BTC price, for unclear reasons, while it’s also unclear if the rise in yields is having a direct effect on the BTC price.

Given the small number of BTC transactions compared to those in fiat currencies, “bitcoin is comparable to the smallest currencies. Bitcoin’s liquidity is much closer to the Thai baht.”

In February, the bank announced its own crypto custody plans, saying that it ""has completed its proof of concept and is aiming for a minimum viable product in 2021 while exploring global client interest for a pilot initiative.""

Meanwhile, the Bank of America (BofA) strategists said in a note Wednesday that ""Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to increased dollar demand,"" as quoted by Bloomberg. Per this note,

""We estimate a net inflow into Bitcoin of just [USD] 93 million would result in price appreciation of 1%, while the similar figure for gold would be closer to [USD] 2 billion or 20 times higher.""

In contrast, they added, ""multibillion money flows do not have a significant impact on price, pointing to the much larger and stable nature of the US Treasuries markets.""

BofA concluded that 'whales' have been buying and hodling BTC since the start of the pandemic, possibly bossing the price, while ""modest capital inflows"" are what has created ""the enormous upside pressure"" on the coin's price in the recent years.

Commenters, however, disagreed with the note's conclusions, arguing that USD 93m is too small of a number, doubting the math, while others say that money doesn't go ""into"" BTC, but to the seller.

At the time of writing (13:34 UTC), BTC trades at USD 58,682 and is almost unchanged in a day. It's up by 1.5% in a week and 19% in a month. The price rallied by 991% in a year.

In a report published Thursday, the firm highlighted the cryptocurrency's illiquidity as an obstacle.

DB also raised questions surrounding bitcoin's rising valuation and whether it is enough for the cryptocurrency to evolve into an asset class.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Deutsche Bank says it expects bitcoin to remain ""ultra-volatile"" due to its limited tradability, adding that just a few large purchases or market exits could significantly impact the cryptocurrency's supply-demand equilibrium.

In a recent report, the firm's research team pointed to the cryptocurrency's illiquidity - which features a set 21 million supply - as an obstacle. Thus far, around 18.7 million or 89% of bitcoins in total circulation have been mined. That expected year for all bitcoins to be mined is 2140, roughly a century from now

""As an investment asset, bitcoin liquidity remains low,"" the report said. ""In 2020, 28 million bitcoins changed hands (150% of total bitcoins in circulation), compared to 40 shares of Apple (270% of its total shares in circulation).""

The heart of the comparison between bitcoin - often referred to as digital gold - and gold boils down to the supply angle, in which both are limited, the report said. One major marginal driver of the price, therefore, becomes the demand.

DB also raised questions surrounding bitcoin's rising valuation and whether it is enough for the cryptocurrency to evolve into an asset class. But a turning point may be in the next two to three years, the group said, after more clarity about the cryptocurrency emerges.

""Bitcoin's market cap of $1 trillion makes it too important to ignore,"" the report said. ""Some people think bitcoin is a commodity. Others think it is a currency. A few think it is a stock. Nevertheless, its market cap is among the top 10, both as a currency and as a stock.""

Bitcoin has seen its price skyrocket 600% year-to-date amid divided opinion on whether it is in a speculative bubble waiting to burst or an asset that's here to stay. It has staged an epic run in March, hitting a $1 trillion market value yet again, and reaching a new peak above the $60,000-level, after an already-robust February.

As of Friday afternoon ET, bitcoin traded around to $58,700.

The focus of the cooperation is on new and innovative products & services combining the complementary capabilities and skills of an experienced payment platform provider with the expertise of a global corporate bank.

The first area of cooperation is an innovative payment fraud prevention solution combining the excellence of TIS’ cloud platform with the long-established expertise of Deutsche Bank in fraud prevention.

Payment fraud is a major issue for CFOs and finance departments. Both parties see increasing demand from clients for effective solutions that are easy to use and can be deployed rapidly.

The software service will extend beyond the payment data of individual customers, leveraging the knowledge of all corporates using the service, while the shared data remains anonymized. The solution will help improve the detection of potential fraud before the payment instruction even leaves a client’s system. Working closely with customers to better understand their challenges and pain points, the new service represents true co-creation.

“Establishing client solutions that are beyond traditional financial services by leveraging Deutsche Bank’s expertise in global payment markets is a key focus area for us. Partnering with TIS and combining our strengths with an established provider of technology-enabled treasury services will provide our clients with a state-of-the-art, multi-bank-enabled risk management tool to mitigate an ever increasing fraud risk”, said Ole Matthiessen, Global Head of Cash Management at Deutsche Bank.

“Harnessing both company and community data to solve key challenges, such as fraud prevention, together with Deutsche Bank is a big win for our customers,” says Erol Bozak, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of TIS. “TIS is excited to team up with a global powerhouse in transaction banking to develop multi-bank payment solutions,” added Joerg Wiemer, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of TIS.
