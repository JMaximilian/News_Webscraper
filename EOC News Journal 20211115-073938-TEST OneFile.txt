Elon Musk,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-elon-musk-spends-another-weekend-insulting-people-on-twitter-11636934985,: Tesla’s Elon Musk spends another weekend insulting people on Twitter,Just last weekend  Musk shot a juvenile insult at Sen. Ron Wyden  D-Ore.  who similarly called for Musk and other billionaires to be taxed more.Last week Musk sold $6.9 billion in Tesla stock (Get it?(Some of those stock sales were put in place before the poll was posted.)Amid news of the sales  Tesla stock sank for its worst week in more than a year.Still  Tesla stock is up 47% year to date  and about 153% higher over the past 12 months.,The world’s richest man is grumpy again.Tesla Inc. TSLA  -2.83% Chief Executive Elon Musk  whose personal wealth has increased by about $250 billion since the start of the pandemic  lashed out at Sen. Bernie Sanders on Twitter over the weekend  after the Vermont independent tweeted: “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.”Musk apparently took the remark personally  replying: “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive.” He later added: “Want me to sell more stock  Bernie? Just say the word …”The comment drew eyerolls and clapbacks from many on Twitter  with the phrase “grow up” being a popular refrain.Just last weekend  Musk shot a juvenile insult at Sen. Ron Wyden  D-Ore.  who similarly called for Musk and other billionaires to be taxed more. Sanders had previously called the vast wealth of Musk and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN  +1.52% founder Jeff Bezos “immoral.”Last month  Musk responded to a proposed tax by the Biden administration on billionaires’ unrealized capital gains by tweeting: “Eventually  they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you.” Also in October  Musk announced Tesla would move its headquarters from California to Texas  which has no state income tax.The anti-tax tantrums have come in the wake of a ProPublica report in June that Musk paid a “true tax rate” of about 3.27% and that he avoided paying any federal taxes in 2018. Musk  who takes no taxable salary  has a personal fortune of about $285 billion  according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index  up more than $116 billion year to date. That includes an $8 billion loss as Tesla shares sank last week.Musk kicked off the weekend by attacking Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard on Twitter  calling him “far the worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career ” and claiming that “He came damn close to killing Tesla.”Eberhard left the company in 2007  and the two have feuded for years. Musk’s comments could violate a non-disparagement agreement that reportedly was part of a settlement after Eberhard sued for defamation in 2007.“Nothing quite like having the richest man in the world attacking you ” Eberhard said in a statement to Fox Business on Friday.In recent weeks  Musk has also snarkily challenged a U.N. officials’ suggestion that he could help ease world hunger and posted sexist tweets that he later deleted.As part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018  Tesla is supposed to pre-approve all of Musk’s tweets. Earlier this year  the SEC said Musk’s tweets violated that policy twice in 2020. However  that’s largely toothless  since there is no real precedent for SEC enforcement of social-media posts  and any potential fines against Musk or Tesla would likely be miniscule compared to their net worth.Last week Musk sold $6.9 billion in Tesla stock (Get it? Get it?)  following a Twitter poll that said he should sell $10 billion in shares. (Some of those stock sales were put in place before the poll was posted.) Musk faces a roughly $15 billion tax bill on his stock options in the coming year  CNBC reported last week  and more stock sales are likely coming. Amid news of the sales  Tesla stock sank for its worst week in more than a year.Still  Tesla stock is up 47% year to date  and about 153% higher over the past 12 months.,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.1,0.07,0.83,True,English,"['Tesla', 'Twitter', 'Tesla Inc.

Although some buyers got a heads-up  there have been multiple reports of buyers getting no warning at all.The issue was first spotted on November 11th  starting a huge discussion on Reddit where many others shared similar experiences. For some cars  only the USB-C ports were missing  but there have been cases of the rear seat USB-A ports being missing as well as wireless charging not working.Tesla says that the global chip shortage is to blame for the lack of USB ports  and customers can make an appointment to get them installed possibly by next month  but they did not guarantee that the ports will be available.This is not uncommon for automotive manufacturers  as brands like BMW  Chevrolet  and Ford have all omitted features due to the chip shortage. The problem is that Tesla did not warn some buyers before shipping out the car  leaving many of them annoyed and disappointed.Although some have gotten advance notice from their delivery specialist  many customers only noticed the missing USB ports after reading articles or forum posts online. For such an expensive car  I think it’s reasonable to at least expect a notice  as well as some compensation. The same thing happened when Tesla removed the adjustable lumbar support from the same models this year without any notice beforehand. The reasoning was unclear  but CEO Elon Musk said that the decision to remove it was due to “almost no usage”.I understand that the chip shortage is affecting many firms and manufacturers  but Tesla should do better when it comes to customer support and communication.[ SOURCE  2  IMAGE SOURCE ],negative,0.0,0.03,0.97,mixed,0.12,0.07,0.81,True,English,"['Tesla', 'Tesla', 'Reddit', 'Tesla', 'BMW', 'Chevrolet', 'Ford', 'Tesla', 'Tesla', 'Tesla']",2021-11-15,2021-11-15,soyacincau.com

Just say the word…”Musk was still firing off tweets 11 hours later  saying Sanders “is a taker  not a maker.”Musk offloaded almost $7 billion worth of Tesla stock over the past week  which helped to push the automaker’s shares down about 15% for the week. Musk’s stock sales began after he tweeted an unusual poll Nov. 7 on Twitter asking whether he should sell.Bernie Sanders | REUTERSThe poll was controversial for a host of reasons. For one  some of Musk’s transactions were carried out under a trading plan he pre-arranged in September  well before he consulted his large social media following. Musk also cast his proposal as having to do with the debate raging in the U.S. over whether billionaires are paying enough in taxes  and whether levies should be placed on unrealized capital gains.Musk didn’t mention in his prior tweets that he had millions of stock options that must be exercised before they expire in August 2022. He said in September that he was likely to exercise “a huge block” of those options toward the end of 2021.In October  Musk said Tesla would move its headquarters from California to Austin  Texas  a state which levies no income tax. On Saturday  Musk tweeted that he’s been living in a small home in South Texas for the past two years. “Feels more homey to live in a small house ” he wrote.Sanders  a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats  chairs the Senate Budget Committee and has long advocated for the wealthy to pay more taxes. In March  he tweeted that the amount of wealth accumulated by Musk and Amazon.com Inc. co-founder Jeff Bezos was “immoral.”Musk also recently chided U.S. Sen.

One of these firms is Policybazaar's parent company PB Fintech  which makes its debut on India's stock exchanges today.Indian startups that have listed or plan to list on India’s stock exchanges in 2021 are rewarding their founders with stock options and bonuses   sources told us. They said the growing trend is aimed at rewarding founders at such firms  in which investors typically have much bigger stakes than the founders.“This has emerged as an important trend in tech startups to instil confidence in the management of a company after the listing ” people involved in the approvals told us.They said in most startups with multiple founders  each ends up having low single-digit holdings in their firms by the time of the IPO. This leaves entrepreneurs with little incentive to continue scaling their ventures even as early investors clock record gains through the IPO  the sources said.Policybazaar parent  which will list on the stock exchanges today (Nov 15)  granted up to 10 657 500 fresh stock options to founder Yashish Dahiya  and 4 567 500 to cofounder Alok Bansal  according to its red herring prospectus. Dahiya and Bansal own 4.27% and 1.45%  respectively  in the firm  while SoftBank owns more than 15%.“Founders have been given long-term Esops for continuing to lead the company over the next six to seven years. In some cases  founders have also invested their own money  to show their confidence in the firm at pre-IPO round valuation ” said one of the founders going public this year  explaining why the board had granted the new stock options and awarded them a bonus for achieving certain milestones.Experts told us this was a positive trend for the startup sector.Siddarth Pai  founding partner at venture fund 3one4 Capital  saidm “Compared to major US startups  where founders can have 30-40% in their company  (in India)  it is in the single digits to early teens  depending on whether it’s a solo founder or multiple cofounders.”“Besides the new options and bonus being an incentive  it also increases their (founders’) stake in the company after the IPO and inspires confidence in management ” he said. “Skin in the game and shareholder alignment are crucial for investors. It’s a combination of factors that are at play  as founders now also have to be answerable to analysts and public shareholders.”The meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on cryptocurrencies on Saturday underscored the divergent views of the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the exchanges on which they are traded.Most stakeholder departments at the meeting favoured some form of regulation but the central bank is believed to have reiterated its advocacy of a ban  citing macroeconomic and financial stability concerns.Following the deliberations  the government is likely to approach the Advertising Standards Council of India soon to push for greater disclosures and stricter statutory warnings with ads about virtual currencies or trading platforms  sources told us.About two crore crypto investors in India are estimated to hold assets worth $4-5 billion.Secretaries from various stakeholder ministries  including finance and home affairs  attended the meeting along with regulators including the RBI. The meeting was called specifically to discuss the way forward on virtual currencies  which have rapidly gained the attention of investors in India.One of the key issues the RBI flagged at the meeting was that these virtual currencies were intangible  making regulation and taxation challenging  said another source. Another issue it raised was that many Indians buy cryptocurrencies from exchanges located overseas  which makes it harder to regulate them.Last week we reported that India may take the “middle path” on cryptocurrencies as it finalises legislation on these virtual assets for the upcoming winter session of Parliament.A source told us that a growing view among policymakers is that the law should take into consideration technological developments in the space.“A balance has to be found ” the person said  adding that a final call on the contours of the law will be taken shortly. “A middle path that balances the concerns of all stakeholders is more likely.”Meanwhile  questions that could shape India’s cryptocurrency rules were discussed at the RBI’s first ever meeting with members of crypto industry players on November 2.Who is supplying cryptocurrency  and how  when there is hardly any mining in the country? How many coins should be listed in India? What kind of coins should be allowed? What protections for investors should be in place?Amid the crypto craze  fuelled by an ad blitz by crypto exchanges  it is unclear how cryptocurrency exchanges are meeting the rising demand. With no rules on disclosure of holdings  no one knows how much crypto is in investors’ e-wallets and how much of this was bought through local exchanges.“If crypto supply keeps on growing  at some stage it could even become a monetary policy challenge. Many in the industry want crypto to be purchased only from exchanges domiciled in India and like banks  these exchanges should be allowed foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 74% ” said a source.The most serious security threat India’s top cryptocurrency exchanges face daily is sophisticated criminal frauds that combine social engineering with computer intrusion. Criminals are impersonating or spoofing social media identities to deceive consumers into giving them access to their cryptocurrency wallets.As a result  cryptocurrency exchanges have experienced a twofold increase in the number of attacks in recent months as bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have touched all-time highs.Beauty ecommerce platform Nykaa saw a 63% year-on-year growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) in the July-September quarter   regulatory filings showed. The company’s consolidated revenue from operations jumped 47% year-on-year to Rs 885.30 crore in the quarter  as against Rs 603.8 crore for the same period last year.For half year ended September 30  the company’s revenues grew 91% to Rs 1 702.3 crore as against Rs 8 924 crore for the same period last year.Its profit after tax for the second quarter of FY22 fell to Rs 1.2 crore from Rs 27 crore in Q2FY21.FSN E-Commerce Ventures  Nykaa’s parent firm  hit the Indian stock exchanges last week in what was a bumper debut for the Mumbai-based firm. Its market cap went past Rs 1 lakh crore on day one after the stock started trading at nearly 80% premium to its issue price of Rs 1 125.The listing propelled Falguni Nayar  its founder and CEO  into the club of top billionaires with a net worth of around $7.4 billion. In an interview with ET last week  Nayar said the company will continue to focus on growth across beauty and fashion businesses.Early-stage venture capital firm 3one4 Capital is looking to increase the fund size of its third fund to almost Rs 1 500 crore from Rs 750 crore  a senior executive said. This comes at a time when venture capital funds are mopping up larger corpuses amid frenetic deal making.The fund has already surpassed Rs 1 000 crore owing to oversubscription from investors. The Rs 750-crore fund came with a green shoe option of Rs 500 crore. The company is likely to extend that by a further Rs 250 crore to close at Rs 1 500 crore.“It has been a great year for venture capital firms. Not only have companies seen heightened investor interest  GPs (general partners) such as ours are also seeing top quartile limited partners backing new funds. We had to increase our fund size to accommodate the incoming investors ” Pranav Pai  founding partner  3one4 Capital told us.3one4  which has invested in companies such as Licious  Darwinbox  and Koo  expects to allocate more funds to back its winner portfolio companies with larger cheque sizes.Fund III is majority subscribed by Indian family offices  endowment funds and institutional investors. Some of the marquee new investors that have backed the fund include CDC Group Plc  the UK sovereign development finance institution; the Japan-India Fund-of-Funds - Nippon India Digital Innovation AIF (NIDIA); South Korean video gaming giant Krafton  Inc; prominent Indian endowments and foundations such as Catamaran and Premji Invest  and several others.Advent International is all set to acquire Encora   an Indian origin IT services firm  from Warburg Pincus for $1.5 billion  sources told us.This comes at a time when the global private equity investor continues to actively buy companies and capitalise on the growing digitisation and cloud migration of businesses the world over.Advent trumped Apax Partners  Blackstone and a European strategic investor to scalp its first tech services buyout in India. A formal announcement is expected in the coming weeks. Warburg might retain a small stake in the company.While Warburg holds 80% in the company  the rest is held by founder Venu Raghavan and management. In 2008  Encora merged with Bengaluru-based Indecomm Corporation.US-based Advent International has $81 billion in assets under management as of June 30  2021. In one of its largest buyouts  Advent and a clutch of investors acquired McAfee Corp .  a global leader in online protection  for an enterprise value of $14 billion last week.The independent directors of Future Retail Ltd (FRL)  in a letter to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Sunday  accused Amazon of submitting to the commission “completely opposite” information that was “contradictory” to Amazon’s own internal communications regarding its 2019 investments into FRL’s promoter company.In their latest letter to the CCI chairman Ashok Kumar Gupta  the directors quoted Amazon’s internal communications and said the US giant was initially planning to pump money directly into FRL through a proposed foreign portfolio investment.In late 2018  the government  through a policy document called Press Note 2  amended foreign direct investment regulations for e-commerce marketplaces  restricting them from selling their own products on their platforms. That prompted Amazon to invest in the promoter firm Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) rather than directly infuse capital into FRL  the letter said.Meanwhile  Myntra’s chief financial officer Ramesh Bafna and chief marketing officer Harish Narayanan have put in their papers .

Period.”While Mr Sanders has not responded yet  the world’s richest person proceeded to shoot off more tweets.“Want me to sell more stock  Bernie? Just say the word...” the 50-year-old tech tycoon  who is also the owner of SpaceX  said in another tweet. Responding to a tweet by a user  Mr Musk again took aim at the politician. “Bernie is a taker  not a maker ” he said.Mr Musk  who had become the richest person in the world with a current estimated personal wealth of $271bn (£201.6bn)  was called out by Twitter users who said his tweet was “excessive” and “inhumane”.“What a deeply offensive thing to say ” author and political activist Marianne Williamson said.Mr Musk’s tweet was also described as “gross and inhumane” by writer Shaun King.Author Molly Jong-Fast said: “This is so excessive.”Hollywood actress Patricia Arquette replied to his tweet  asking: “Short term memory issues?”Economist David Rothschild said “every billionaire owes massive debt to security  human capital  infrastructure  democracy that made their fortune possible.”Brian Altano  a video producer  said Mr Musk could “even pay a little every month  like how you pay your child support.”The chief executive’s efforts to pick a fight with a politician is his second such attempt in recent weeks. Earlier  he had hit out at Ron Wyden  the chairman of the senate’s finance committee  with another crude tweet.“Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll ” Mr Wyden had said.“Why does ur [profile picture] look like u just came?” Mr Musk had shot back.Mr Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla but is instead required to pay taxes on gains.

What maidens loth? ‘What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? ‘What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? ‘Heard melodies are sweet  but those unheard ‘Are sweeter; therefore  ye soft pipes  play on’‘Ode on a Grecian Urn’  by John KeatsWhat a wonderful time to be alive!Wait…news flash…Our Doom Index has just hit ‘8’…which is ‘Crash Alert’ level. Details tomorrow…Meanwhile  the world is just chock-a-block with marvellous  magical  absurd  and absolutely ridiculous things. Like a city sewer in a flood  we are awash in things best not looked at too closely.But since it’s Friday  let us at least take a look at something that happened last week.3 519 252 financial advisorsAs every sentient being on the planet knows  Elon Musk  the world’s richest — and clearly  cleverest — man decided to guide his financial life via a Twitter poll. That is  he asked the Twittersphere if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla [NASDAQ:TSLA].This is obviously a novel way of making decisions. And perhaps better.If two heads are better than one…surely  the 3 519 252 poll respondents  including the 2 037 647 who answered ‘Yay’  raise the quality of the decision at least to a C+.What is most amazing about the whole thing is that 3 519 252 people…all supposedly compos mentis…probably adultish…presumably with real lives…actually found the time to weigh in on a financial question that didn’t concern them.The decision would normally be of interest to only one  the very one person who — if results are anything to go on — is the most qualified human being to make the call.After all  if the world’s most successful man can’t decide when to buy or sell his own stock  who can?Have your sayAnd now that we see that there are so many people ready to help with our personal decision-making…perhaps we should make use of it.Should we have a café latte this morning…or a cappuccino? You decide for us.Where should we invest? In stocks? Bonds? Farmland in Argentina or Nicaragua (prices are low because they are…like…disaster areas)? Tell us  please.Is it time to buy a new pair of blue jeans? Get a COVID booster shot? Wink at the pretty barista? We need guidance.We invite replies and promise to abide by the results as faithfully as we would if they came from the US federal government or the Papal See.Wacky worldThey should have taken a flier on DWAC instead. Digital World Acquisition Corp is a SPAC…a special-purpose acquisition company. In this case  its special purpose was buying Donald Trump’s new company — Trump Media & Technology Group.And when word of the purchase got out  DWAC shot up. Shares rose from US$10 to US$175.As a general rule (in our rulebook  at least)  all SPAC deals are bad deals. But who knows? There was no trace of it in the documents made available to the public  but DWAC might even eventually come up with a way to make money.And in this wacky world  you don’t need to make money to get money. What money do the cryptos make? What money do the NFTs make?What money has Elon Musk made? What money did Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell make? Between the two of them  they gained US$105 million in new wealth since 2004. Where did it come from?HOODWINKED! Why Australia’s ‘miracle’ economy is a farceTwitter says sell!So  let’s return to the other curiosities surrounding this story.And don’t worry if we get the facts wrong; they hardly matter. What matters is the cockeyed principle of the thing…which is what we’re trying to figure out.In any event  Musk’s poll was taken. The twitterers rendered judgement. And it was in the affirmative.This news then had a remarkable effect (but not at all unanticipated…at least  not by Elon Musk’s bro  Kimbal  who sold US$109 million worth of shares on Friday).Earlier this week  Tesla stock fell  wiping out nearly US$235 billion from the value of the company.That vanished US$235 billion represents more than the combined value of GM  BMW  and Ford. In other words…well…there really are no words that can do the situation justice.Elon effectInvestors who judged the stock worth US$1 243 on Thursday of last week found it was worth only US$1 011 on Tuesday of this week.Same company. Same products. Same earnings. Same markets. Same Joe Biden. Same Elon Musk. Same customers. Same problems. Same weather. Same COVID. Same everything. So why would a share be nearly 19% less valuable?We hope you’re not expecting an answer from us.As far as we can tell  Elon is sui generis…an economic law all of his own. God? Man? We can’t say. But when he pipes up…investors hear melodies so sweet  they can’t resist.If he buys something  it goes up. If he mentions something  it goes up. Even if he mentions something else by mistake  it goes up too.So far  the Elon effect is the most reliable indicator in modern finance.Enrichment of ElonAnd now  Elon is the richest biped ever to walk on the planet. That is odd too  considering that up ‘til now  his contribution in goods and services is worth (net) less than zero.Add up all the money that has been invested in Elon’s projects. Subtract the value of all goods and services (mainly Tesla cars) rendered.Do this for Edison  Ford  Rockefeller  Jobs  even Zuckerberg — almost any really rich person — and the sum will be hugely positive.Their companies make profits by providing goods and/or services that are more valuable than the resources (including capital and labour) that go into them.We’re not going to do the math for Elon. It’s too much work. But the result must be a staggeringly negative number. His businesses do not make money  they lose it. They destroy wealth  they don’t create it.He is so rich because the Federal Reserve has falsified the value of capital…and rigged the auto market with carbon credits. There is also the mysterious Elon effect  for which we offer no explanation.Enrichment of the elitesThe enrichment of Elon  in other words  parallels the growing wealth of the entire elite caste.It is not based on actual output — neither on sales nor on profits — but on fake money and fake interest rates.It favours gamblers…showmen……geniuses  as well as grifters.And as we saw last week  it goes as well as comes.Regards Bill Bonner For The Rum RebellionPS: The Rum Rebellion is a fantastic place to start your investment journey.

Elon Musk is at it again. This time he’s aimed his insensitive tweet at Senator Bernie Sanders.“I keep forgetting you’re still alive ” Musk tweeted Sunday morning. The tweet was in response to Sanders’s tweet that suggested the extremely wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes.“Want me to sell more stock  Bernie? Just say the words…” Musk tweeted shortly afterMusk closed off the week selling a total of $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares  which only amounted to less than 4% of the shares he holds  and less than 3%  including all the options he owns to buy additional shares  CNN reported.One thing is for sure  Musk is among the list of those that qualify under Sander’s description of “the extremely wealthy.” In fact  he’s the world’s richest person  with a net worth of $285 billion  according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index.When Musk asked Twitter if he should sell 10% of his Tesla holdings to pay taxes  58% of voters responded with a yes. But it’s questionable if Musk will agree with the poll’s results. He does face a looming tax bill that will be triggered by his need to exercise 22.9 million options to buy shares before late next summer. The cost of doing that will be nearly $10 billion at current market prices.Musk could also owe California state income tax  which has a max tax rate of 13.3%. Despite his move to Texas  a state that has no state income tax  but he still spends a lot of time working in the state and  therefore  will have to still pay state taxes there.Sander’s is all for taxing the extremely wealthy. As the Senate’s budget committee chair  he has proposed an annual tax on the top 0.1 percent of US households  which he says will raise about $4.35 trillion over the next decade and cut the wealth of billionaires in half within the next 15 years. He also wants to put in place key enforcement policies on the proposed wealth taxes.Democrats have continued to try to impose a billionaires tax to fund President Joe Biden’s sweeping social safety net plan.“Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll ” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon tweeted in response to Musk’s Twitter poll. “It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share.

On Sunday (14th) US Eastern time  Elon Musk had a war of words with US Senator Bernie Sanders (Bernie Sanders). Musk mentioned selling more shares of Tesla.""We must ask the richest people to pay their taxes fairly "" Sanders wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Under US law  Mr Musk is required to pay tax on the value-added portion of the stock.Musk responded to the 80-year-old senator's tweet: ""I always forgot you were still alive."" In a subsequent tweet  Musk chased again and asked  ""Bernie  do you want me to sell more shares?"" Let me get this straight. ""In the past week  Mr Musk has sold nearly $7 billion worth of Tesla shares  driving the company's share price down about 15 per cent in a week.Mr Musk also owns millions of Tesla stock options  which must be exercised before they expire in August 2022. He said in September that he was likely to exercise ""a large number"" of options by the end of 2021.Billionaires can benefit from tax avoidance strategies  while those whose income comes from traditional wages cannot. Large amounts of wealth usually come from the appreciation of stocks and real estate  which are not considered taxable unless they are sold.A small house feels more like home.In October  Mr Musk said Tesla would move his headquarters from California to Austin  Texas  where there is no income tax. Musk tweeted on Saturday that he had been living in a small house in southern Texas for the past two years and ""feels more at home"".Mr Musk  Tesla's largest shareholder  launched an opinion poll on Twitter on November 6 asking his 62.5 million followers whether he should sell 10 per cent of Tesla's shares. ""recently  many people think that unrealized income is a means of tax avoidance  so I propose to sell 10 per cent of Tesla shares. Do you support this proposal? "" He said.Mr Musk said he would ""abide by the result of the vote"" regardless of the outcome. At the time of his Twitter posting  the 10 per cent stake was about 17 million shares  and based on the week's closing price  the 10 per cent sale would be worth nearly $21 billion.He sold 6.36 million shares last week  or about 37 per cent of 17 million shares. He now needs to sell about 10 million more shares to deliver on his promise to sell 10 per cent of his shares.The sell-off is Musk's first such large-scale sell-off since Tesla was founded in 2003. By capital market standards  the scale of the sell-off is larger than that of the initial public offerings of most companies.Tesla shares closed down 2.8% at $1033.42 on Friday  ending an 11-week rally.

Elon Musk,Bing API,https://www.forbesindia.com/article/column/ev-revolution-in-india-still-work-in-progress/71527/1,Electric Vehicles: Much-anticipated EV Revolution In India Still Work In Progress,In the middle of 2012  as Ashlee Vance writes in Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future  “Tesla Motors stunned its complacent peers in the automotive industry.The much-anticipated EV ‘revolution’ in India is still a work in progress  with the country lagging the big markets like the United States and China by a bit.Clearly  the revolution would be truly on us when more and more sedans and SUVs are running on electric motors and electric battery packs.Deputy Editor Rajiv Singh tracked down a little-known venture that was founded in 2015  has a factory in Alwar in Rajasthan and which  in six years  has emerged No 2 in India’s electric scooter market.(This story appears in the 19 November  2021 issue of Forbes India.,Tech trends are usually first noticed and picked up—besides  of course  being pioneered—by the geeks. And  if Bengaluru is indeed the Silicon Valley of India  you would be tempted to believe that many Indian tech and internet businesses would have attracted their early adopters from the Garden City—from ecommerce (Bangalore in 1999 was home to India’s first ecommerce startup  Fabmart) and ride-sharing to edtech and software as a service. This claim isn’t backed by data  but it’s a trend that has typically played out in Palo Alto and Mountain View  the two main cities of the original Valley  when the latest computing devices have been launched—and  when electric vehicles (EVs) became the latest gizmo in town  courtesy of Tesla.In the middle of 2012  as Ashlee Vance writes in Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future  “Tesla Motors stunned its complacent peers in the automotive industry. It began shipping the Model S sedan. The all-electric vehicle could go more than 300 miles on a single charge. It could reach 60 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds…”There was more  for the technophile. The Model S had an internet connection (almost a decade ago). “While the owner slept  Tesla’s engineers tapped into the car via the internet connection and downloaded software updates. When the customer took the car out for a spin in the morning and found it working right  he was left feeling as if the magical elves had done the work.”Unsurprisingly then  writes Vance  the first people to notice what Tesla had accomplished were the technophiles in Silicon Valley. “…the early adopters proved willing not only to spend $100 000 on a product that might not work but also to trust their well-being to a startup”.The much-anticipated EV ‘revolution’ in India is still a work in progress  with the country lagging the big markets like the United States and China by a bit. And most of the EVs sold in India are two-wheelers and three-wheelers. Clearly  the revolution would be truly on us when more and more sedans and SUVs are running on electric motors and electric battery packs.The role of Bengaluru in fuelling that revolution can be debated  but what’s pretty clear is  as Forbes India’s Technology Editor Harichandan Arakali found out  Bengaluru is home to a bustling EV startup ecosystem. One such exciting fledgling venture would be Ultraviolette Automotive  which is close to launching a high-performance motorcycle  which will go head-on against the heavier hogs in the 300-500 cc segment. For more on other startups in the EV race  don’t miss Arakali’s ‘Powering On’.To be sure  EV action is all over the country  from startups to conglomerates. Deputy Editor Rajiv Singh tracked down a little-known venture that was founded in 2015  has a factory in Alwar in Rajasthan and which  in six years  has emerged No 2 in India’s electric scooter market.The Forbes India cover story is on a traditional carmaker that’s come back into the reckoning and is attempting to do what several global and Indian carmakers have struggled with: To become an EV major to reckon with. By pumping in $2 billion over four years to launch 10 new EVs—$1 billion raised via private equity—India’s third-largest car maker is hoping to get a fifth of its sales from electric by 2025-26. On how Tata Motors plans to lead the charge in EVs and create the required ecosystem  Assistant Editor Manu Balachandran’s Tata Motors: The Phoenix Building India’s Electric Vehicle Play is a must read.(This story appears in the 19 November  2021 issue of Forbes India.
