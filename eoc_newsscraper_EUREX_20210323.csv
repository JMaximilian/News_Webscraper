EUREX,0,thetradenews.com,https://www.thetradenews.com/eurex-and-korea-exchange-expand-partnership-with-futures-launch/,2021-03-15,Eurex and Korea Exchange expand partnership with futures launch,"Eurex has expanded its partnership with the Korea Exchange (KRX) with the listing of new futures contracts, providing greater market access for international investors.

As of 22 March, Eurex will list futures on the Korean benchmark index KOSPI 200 and will be the only venue that offers international investors access to the Korean market outside Korean trading hours.

Eurex has listed overnight KOSPI 200 options and mini-KOSPI 200 futures in 2010 and 2016, respectively.

“With the new KOSPI 200 Futures, we will offer unique trading and hedging efficiencies to our clients. Market participants will benefit from operational but most importantly from margin efficiencies,” said Michael Peters, chief executive of Eurex.

“Adding KOSPI 200 Futures to our link is therefore the logical next step in our successful partnership.”

The pair said that their newly expanded offering, including KOSPI 200 Options which are among the four most heavily exchange traded index contracts globally, would allow for better exposure to and hedging of the Korean derivatives market.

“This product line-up will allow market participants to access the Korean market almost around the clock,” said Sohn Byungdoo, chairman and chief executive of KRX.

“We believe the new offering will make the Korean derivatives market more attractive and further strengthen the decade-long partnership between KRX and Eurex.”

Eurex and KRX confirmed that they were also looking to launch a corresponding foreign exchange product on the same joint link between the two entities.

The pair said their expanded partnership marked their commitment to connecting markets globally, with Eurex also partnering with FTSE Russell to launch derivatives contracts earlier this month.","Eurex has expanded its partnership with the Korea Exchange (KRX) with the listing of new futures contracts, providing greater market access for international investors.

The execution algorithms will be used by buy- and sell-side traders to execute orders equity, fixed income, and commodity futures contracts on the OSE.

“Quantitative Brokers is a rapidly growing advanced execution service provider that will offer innovative execution options to our market participants, and we anticipate that this expansion will enrich our user’s experience and contribute to the continuous growth of our market,” said Akira Tagaya, executive officer of the OSE.

Quantitative Brokers’ full suite of algorithms will be available at OSE, including Bolt, for arrival pricing, Strobe, for TWAP/VWAP, Closer, for settlement pricing, Octane, for seeking liquidity, and The Roll, for calendar roll execution. The algorithmic suite technology is co-located at JPX leveraging the closest proximity to the exchange’s matching engines.

“The addition of OSE’s multi-asset offering within the QB suite of execution algorithms is extremely exciting and comes in response to strong client demand,” said Christian Hauff, Quantitative Brokers co-founder and CEO.

The launch on OSE is part of Quantitative Brokers’ expansion into Asia Pacific, which has been ongoing since the opening of its regional office in Sydney in 2018. The firm launched its algorithms suite on the Singapore Exchange derivatives market in October last year.

In December, Quantitative Brokers also appointed former Eurex executive, Tim Gits, to oversee its expansion strategy and team growth in the region. Talking to The TRADE about his appointment, Gits confirmed in December that the firm planned to support the expansion with potential rollouts at the Japan Exchange and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.

In December, German exchange group Deutsche Börse acquired a majority stake in Quantitative Brokers after a deal was agreed in September.

Financial markets are worried with how high Treasury yields can go. Treasuries have declined for seven straight weeks and that has triggered been the primary driver for US dollar strength.

Monday is the start of the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Summit four-day summit that will have key speeches from ECB’s Lagarde, BOE’s Bailey and the Fed’s Powell. Must-watch TV will happen on Wednesday when Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have their first joint appearance before the U.S House Financial Services committee. Powell and Yellen will also speak together before the Senate banking panel on Thursday, which should be mostly reaffirmations of the current ultra-accommodative stance with a united defense over the Fed and Treasury pandemic policies.

The key economic releases of the trading week will be the flash PMI readings across the US and Europe on Wednesday and US personal income and spending data at the end of the week.

Will the bond market selloff continue and send the dollar higher?

Emerging Market Central Bank Watchers expecting CNB, SARB, and MNB to keep rates steady.

How much more downside risks remain for oil prices?

Country

US



It is still all about the bond market. The Fed’s latest decision to end emergency capital relief to banks will make the upcoming Treasury auctions very important. If bank interest is low, the bond market selloff could intensify. Eventually skyrocketing Treasury yields, perhaps the 10-year Treasury yield closer to 2.25%, will trigger Fed action.

Now that the Fed has ultra-accommodation on cruise control, investors will need to see strong upside surprises with key data for it to excite markets. A wrath of economic data will be released, with many traders focusing on the flash PMI readings, final fourth quarter GDP readings, and personal income and spending data. The PCE inflation readings for February will draw some attention but they are not yet expected to rise significantly.

The biggest short-term risk to the economic outlook remains virus variant risks and this upcoming week could start to show cases are rising across more states. A handful of states are seeing virus cases increase as the faster spreading variants become the dominant strain and as some states reopen early.

EU

The listless Covid-vaccine rollout in the EU is worrying investors and souring sentiment towards European equities and the euro. The EU has bet heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine, and reports of serious side effects from the vaccine led to the suspension of AstraZeneca shots by a number of EU members, including heavyweights France, Germany and Italy. The European Medical Agency declared AstraZeneca safe to use on Thursday, and countries that had suspended its use will resume the jabs today or next week. Still, all the negative publicity has caused hesitancy among the non-vaccinated populace, and Europe’s vaccine numbers will have to improve in order to raise sentiment towards European equities and the euro.

On Wednesday, Germany, the Eurozone and France release the services and manufacturing PMIs for March. The Manufacturing PMIs continue to show strong expansion, but the services sector remains in contraction territory, with readings below the neutral 50-level. ECB President Christine Lagarde will speak at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements on Wednesday, and any comments from Lagarde about higher bond yields could move the market.

As well, the German cabinet is due to sign off on a 2022 budget plan. On Thursday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said that Germany needs to increase debt spending to help tackle the impact of the coronavirus. Sholz said that he is considering a “timely, targeted and temporary” stimulus plan to revive economic growth once the coronavirus eases.

UK

The Bank of England held steady with monetary policy this week, maintaining interest rates at 0.10% and QE at 895 billion pounds. Investors will be interested in next week’s ‘BoEspeak’, which may shed light on the central bank’s plans, in the light of rising bond yields. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey will participate in panel discussions on Tuesday and Thursday. The BoE will release the FPC minutes from the bank’s last policy meeting and the FPC quarterly statement on Friday. On the data front, the UK releases inflation numbers and PMIs for services and manufacturing.

Switzerland

The SNB sets interest rates on a quarterly basis. Interest rates have been pegged at -0.75%, the lowest of any DM central bank. The bank has done its best to make the Swiss franc less attractive to investors, in order to protect exports. However, the markets have largely ignored the negative interest rate, as the Swissie remains an attractive safe-haven asset.

Emerging Markets



Czech Republic The Czech National Bank is expected to maintain interest rates at 0.25%. The bank has slashed rates since March 2020, when rates were at 1.75%.

South Africa The South African Reserve Bank’s interest rate stands at 3.5%, where it has been pegged since July 2020. No change is expected at next week’s meeting.

Hungary The central bank (MNB) is projected to maintain interest rates at a record low of 0.60%, where it has been pegged since July 2020.

China

The rise in US yields, the ongoing crackdown on China big-tech, and a rocky start to US talks in Alaska has seen retail hot money liquidating Mainland and Hong Kong stocks, despite a number of IPO’s about to hit the Hong Kong market. The Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 technical pictures have now moved into bearish retracement territory leaving both markets vulnerable to deeper selloffs in the coming week.

No sign was seen of China’s “national team” intervening on Friday to reverse the sharp falls in both indexes, and if they remain sidelined next week, the selloff could turn into a rout.

China releases its latest Loan Prime Rates decisions on Monday in a quiet data week. No change is expected but the PBOC continues keeping liquidity tight via the repo market. Again, another negative factor for China stocks.

The Yuan has remained stable around 6.5000, limiting the contagion of higher US rates and the Dollar in China and Asian EM as a whole. If the fixings are moved higher next week aggressively, that could all change. The week ahead will be dominated by US treasury yields and their impact on retail equity investors across Asia..

India

No significant data.

The INR has proven invulnerable to US Dollar strength although the Sensex ends the week 3.0% lower. With India forex reserves climbing to the 4th highest in the world, markets appear reluctant to sell the INR and test the RBI. But a deeper US bond selloff next week leaves both the INR and Indian equity markets vulnerable to an EM taper tantrum.

India remains one of the most vulnerable countries to rising US yields and commodity prices due to its weak current account and foreign currency denominated debt.

Australia & New Zealand

No significant data.

A simply stellar week of Australian data and a dovish RBA minutes could not save the Australian Dollar. Markets instead are laser focused on the continuing rise in Australian CGB yields and fears the RBA may have to tighten sooner. The rise in US long yields is having an outsized effect on that equation.

Australian equities are treading water with steeper yield curves and firm commodity prices supporting banks and resources, but weighing on other sectors.banks. The technical charts show the ASX 200 in danger of joining the All Ordinaries in downside correction territory. Both are vulnerable to a weaker Wall Street next week.

Similarly, the AUstralian and New Zealand Dollars gave up all their gains for the week and both have failed to recapture their downside breakout levels. More US Dollar strength and/or higher yields next week threaten both with 200 point moves possible.

Japan

Japan data showed signs of a nascent recovery although inflation remains as elusive as ever. Markets focused on the Bank of Japan meeting which has widened the corridor in which JGB’s can trade, sending yields higher. The BOJ also stated they would only buy Topix-related ETFs going forward, not Nikkei 225-linked ones. Both developments are negatives for the Nikkei 225 into next week with only second-tier data releases. Like other North Asian indexes, the Nikkei 225 is in danger of breaking into downside correction territory in the coming week.

The Japanese Yen has proven immune to both US developments and the BOJ tolerating higher rates, being unchanged around 109.00 the past week. Higher JGB yields could prompt repatriation flows next week pushing USD/JPY lower. However if the pace of US yield rises remains the same, the balance shifts towards USD/JPY rising above 110.00.

Markets

Oil



Crude prices took a big hit after the demand outlook crumbled following Europe’s struggle with COVID-19. Adding to the selling pressure was a surge in Treasury yields that kept the dollar strong. The short-term crude demand outlook could deteriorate even further if Europe shows significant vaccine hesitancy. The risks are growing that Europe won’t have a normal summer and that could drag down jet fuel demand forecasts.

The demand outlook remains strong for the second half of the year, but oil prices could still see some further short-term pain if the virus spread across Europe does not improve.

Gold

Gold is well off the post-Fed highs, but still looking to finish the week on a positive note despite a strong move higher for Treasury yields. Gold ETF outflows continued for a sixth consecutive week, but the pace is slowing.

The next few months will be very tricky in identifying what will be the primary catalysts for bullion investors. Wall Street will remain fixated on the bond market selloff and recent disdain for technology stocks. Gold is starting to attract some investors because eventually rising Treasury yields will surely be countered by Fed action. The S&P 500 index won’t be able to climb higher if mega-cap tech stocks don’t get their groove back and any hesitancy in that trade should trigger some safe-haven flows into gold.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin has been somewhat steady despite a very volatile time on Wall Street. Institutional interest excitement is somewhat easing and prices appear poised to consolidate. It seems that only investments over $100 million will only spark some excitement now that Bitcoin prices remain elevated.

Regulatory fears are starting to return, but nothing major appears to be on the immediate horizon, but that could quickly change.

Financial markets are worried with how high Treasury yields can go. Treasuries have declined for seven straight weeks and that has triggered the primary driver for US dollar strength.

Monday is the start of the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Summit, a four-day summit that will have key speeches from ECB’s President Christine , BOE Governor Andrew and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Must-watch TV will happen on Wednesday when Fed Chair and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have their first joint appearance before the U.S House Financial Services committee. Powell and Yellen will also speak together before the Senate banking panel on Thursday, which should be mostly reaffirmations of the current ultra-accommodative stance with a united defense over the Fed and Treasury pandemic policies.

The key economic releases of the trading week will be the flash PMI readings across the US and Europe on Wednesday and US and data at the end of the week.

US

It is still all about the bond market. The Fed’s latest decision to end emergency capital relief to banks will make the upcoming Treasury auctions very important. If bank interest is low, the bond market selloff could intensify. Eventually skyrocketing Treasury yields, perhaps the Treasury yield closer to 2.25%, will trigger Fed action.

Now that the Fed has ultra-accommodation on cruise control, investors will need to see strong upside surprises with key data for it to excite markets. A wrath of economic data will be released, with many traders focusing on the flash PMI readings, final fourth quarter readings, and personal income and spending data. The inflation readings for February will draw some attention but they are not yet expected to rise significantly.

The biggest short-term risk to the economic outlook remains virus variant risks and this week could start to show cases are rising across more states. A handful of states are seeing virus cases increase as the faster spreading variants become the dominant strain and as some states reopen early.

EU

The listless COVID vaccine rollout in the EU is worrying investors and souring sentiment towards European equities and the . The EU has bet heavily on the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccine, and reports of serious side effects from the vaccine led to the suspension of AstraZeneca shots by a number of EU members, including heavyweights France, Germany and Italy.

The European Medical Agency declared AstraZeneca safe to use on Thursday, and countries that had suspended its use will resume the jabs today or next week. Still, all the negative publicity has caused hesitancy among the non-vaccinated populace, and Europe’s vaccine numbers will have to improve in order to raise sentiment towards European equities and the euro.

On Wednesday, Germany ( , ), the Eurozone ( , ) and France ( , ) release their services and manufacturing PMIs for March.

The Manufacturing PMIs continue to show strong expansion, but the services sector remains in contraction territory, with readings below the neutral 50-level. ECB President Christine Lagarde will speak at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements on Wednesday, and any comments from Lagarde about higher bond yields could move the market.

As well, the German cabinet is due to sign off on a 2022 budget plan. On Thursday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said that Germany needs to increase debt spending to help tackle the impact of the coronavirus. Sholz said that he is considering a “timely, targeted and temporary” stimulus plan to revive economic growth once the coronavirus eases.

UK

The Bank of England held steady with monetary policy last week, maintaining at 0.10% and QE at 895 billion pounds. Investors will be interested in this week’s ‘ ’, which may shed light on the central bank’s plans, in the light of rising bond yields.

BoE Governor Andrew Bailey will participate in panel discussions on Tuesday and Thursday. The BoE will release the from the bank’s last policy meeting and the FPC quarterly statement on Friday. On the data front, the UK releases numbers and PMIs for and .

Switzerland

The SNB sets on a quarterly basis. Interest rates have been pegged at -0.75%, the lowest of any DM central bank. The bank has done its best to make the less attractive to investors, in order to protect exports. However, the markets have largely ignored the negative interest rate, as the Swissie remains an attractive safe-haven asset.

Emerging Markets



Czech Republic: The Czech National Bank is expected to maintain at 0.25%. The bank has slashed rates since March 2020, when rates were at 1.75%.

South Africa The South African Reserve Bank’s stands at 3.5%, where it has been pegged since July 2020. No change is expected at next week’s meeting.

Hungary The central bank (MNB) is projected to maintain at a record low of 0.60%, where it has been pegged since July 2020.

China

The rise in US yields, the ongoing crackdown on China big-tech, and a rocky start to US talks in Alaska has seen retail hot money liquidating Mainland and Hong Kong stocks, despite a number of IPO’s about to hit the market. The and technical pictures have now moved into bearish retracement territory leaving both markets vulnerable to deeper selloffs in the coming week.

No sign was seen of China’s “national team” intervening on Friday to reverse the sharp falls in both indexes, and if they remain sidelined next week, the selloff could turn into a rout.

China releases its latest decisions on Monday in a quiet data week. No change is expected but the PBOC continues keeping liquidity tight via the repo market. Again, another negative factor for China stocks.

The has remained stable around 6.5000, limiting the contagion of higher US rates and the in China and Asian EM as a whole. If the fixings are moved higher this week aggressively, that could all change. The week ahead will be dominated by US treasury yields and their impact on retail equity investors across Asia..

India

No significant data.

The has proven invulnerable to US dollar strength although the ends the week 3.0% lower. With India forex reserves climbing to the 4th highest in the world, markets appear reluctant to sell the INR and test the RBI. But a deeper US bond selloff this week leaves both the INR and Indian equity markets vulnerable to an EM taper tantrum.

India remains one of the most vulnerable countries to rising US yields and commodity prices due to its weak current account and foreign currency denominated debt.

Australia And New Zealand

No significant data.

A simply stellar week of Australian data and a dovish could not save the . Markets instead are laser focused on the continuing rise in Australian CGB yields and fears the RBA may have to tighten sooner. The rise in US long yields is having an outsized effect on that equation.

Australian equities are treading water with steeper yield curves and firm commodity prices supporting banks and resources, but weighing on other sectors The technical charts show the in danger of joining the in downside correction territory. Both are vulnerable to a weaker Wall Street this week.

Similarly, the Australian and dollars gave up all their gains last week and both have failed to recapture their downside breakout levels. More US dollar strength and/or higher yields this week threaten both with 200 point moves possible.

Japan

Japan data showed signs of a nascent recovery although inflation remains as elusive as ever. Markets focused on the Bank of Japan which has widened the corridor in which JGB’s can trade, sending yields higher. The BOJ also stated they would only buy -related ETFs going forward, not Nikkei 225-linked ones. Both developments are negatives for the into this week with only second-tier data releases. Like other North Asian indexes, the Nikkei 225 is in danger of breaking into downside correction territory in the coming week.

The Japanese has proven immune to both US developments and the BOJ tolerating higher rates, being unchanged around 109.00 the past week. Higher JGB yields could prompt repatriation flows this week pushing USD/JPY lower. However if the pace of US yield rises remains the same, the balance shifts towards USD/JPY rising above 110.00.

Markets

Oil



prices took a big hit after the demand outlook crumbled following Europe’s struggle with COVID-19. Adding to the selling pressure was a surge in Treasury yields that kept the dollar strong.

The short-term crude demand outlook could deteriorate even further if Europe shows significant vaccine hesitancy. The risks are growing that Europe won’t have a normal summer and that could drag down jet fuel demand forecasts.

The demand outlook remains strong for the second half of the year, but oil prices could still see some further short-term pain if the virus spread across Europe does not improve.

Gold

is well off the post-Fed highs, but still looking to finish the week on a positive note despite a strong move higher for Treasury yields. Gold ETF (NYSE: ) outflows continued for a sixth consecutive week, but the pace is slowing.

The next few months will be very tricky in identifying what will be the primary catalysts for bullion investors. Wall Street will remain fixated on the bond market selloff and recent disdain for technology stocks.

Gold is starting to attract some investors because eventually rising Treasury yields will surely be countered by Fed action. The index won’t be able to climb higher if mega-cap tech stocks don’t get their groove back and any hesitancy in that trade should trigger some safe-haven flows into gold.

Bitcoin

has been somewhat steady despite a very volatile time on Wall Street. Institutional interest excitement is somewhat easing and prices appear poised to consolidate. It seems that only investments over $100 million will only spark some excitement now that Bitcoin prices remain elevated.

Regulatory fears are starting to return, but nothing major appears to be on the immediate horizon, but that could quickly change.

HSBC,1,delta-optimist.com,https://www.delta-optimist.com/national-news/lawyer-for-meng-wanzhou-argues-new-evidence-would-challenge-hsbc-loan-loss-risk-3543935,2021-03-16,Lawyer for Meng Wanzhou argues new evidence would challenge HSBC loan loss risk,"VANCOUVER — A lawyer for Huawei's chief financial officer says there's no evidence that international bank HSBC suffered an increased risk of loan loss as a result of Meng Wanzhou's alleged actions. Frank Addario made the comment as he asked a B.C.

VANCOUVER — A lawyer for Huawei's chief financial officer says there's no evidence that international bank HSBC suffered an increased risk of loan loss as a result of Meng Wanzhou's alleged actions.

Frank Addario made the comment as he asked a B.C. Supreme Court judge to admit new evidence in Meng's extradition case.

""There was never any risk the bank could incur a loss,"" Addario said, before receiving pushback from both the judge and a lawyer for Canada's attorney general.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver's airport in 2018 at the request of the United States to face fraud charges that both she and Huawei deny.

She is accused of misrepresenting Huawei's control over technology company Skycom in a 2013 presentation to HSBC, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.

On Monday, the B.C. Supreme Court entered the second in seven weeks of argument in Meng's case, which culminates in an actual extradition or committal hearing in May.

The evidence her team wants to introduce is an affidavit from an accountant that details credit facilities and loans issued between 2013 and 2017.

Court documents from Meng's team outlining the proposed evidence say that HSBC executed the first loan one week before Meng's presentation, so they argue the bank could not have been influenced by it. The next two loans were issued to Huawei subsidiaries, and her lawyers say that suggests they were too far removed from the sanction violation risks.

HSBC was not a lender in the final syndicated loan.

Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes challenged Addario's assessment of why the loans were mentioned by the United States in the record of the case in the first place.

The United States appears to rely on a casual link that is ""framed broadly"" rather than alleging that a particular loan was sought on the basis of a particular representation that turned out to be false, putting that loan at risk, Holmes said.

""It's much broader, which is a banking relationship that was continued because of the alleged misrepresentation and therefore all loans made within that banking relationship were at risk,"" Holmes said.

Addario responded that he did not believe that the specifics of how the loans might be at risk had been ""settled.""

Holmes also suggested that fraud law recognizes inherent risk in any loan, even when it is repaid.

A lawyer representing Canada's attorney general described the proposed evidence as ""irrelevant"" and urged the judge to reject it.

Robert Frater argued the evidence shows the bank didn't lose money on the loans, but doesn't speak to risk.

""The evidence I would submit is capable of showing Huawei is not a deadbeat and the banks are doing just fine,"" Frater said.

""Do either of those facts help you with any issue that would be relevant to committal? We say they don't.""

Arguments over fraud law should be argued at the extradition hearing, but excluding the proposed evidence wouldn't weaken Meng's argument at that stage anyway, Frater said.

Deprivation involves a risk of economic loss and the requesting state does not have to prove actual loss, he said.

The ""most alarming"" part of Addario's submission was it was the last ""scheduled"" application to introduce new evidence, rather than the last application, period, he said.

""In our submission it has no merit, it's time to move on to committal,"" Frater said.

The court adjourned until Wednesday, when arguments will begin in a crucial leg of the case.

The conduct of Canadian police and border officers will face the court's scrutiny as Meng's team begins arguments that her charter rights were violated during her questioning and arrest at Vancouver's airport.

They allege Meng was subjected to an abuse of process and proceedings should be stayed, while officers have testified they acted appropriately.

HSBC,1,cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-hsbc-fraud-1.5950969,2021-03-16,Lawyer for Meng Wanzhou claims HSBC had no risk of loss,"A lawyer for Huawei's chief financial officer is asking a B.C. Supreme Court judge to admit new evidence in her extradition case.

Frank Addario says the evidence should be allowed if the Crown plans to argue that an international bank at the centre of Meng Wanzhou's fraud case suffered a real risk of loan loss as a result of her alleged actions.

Meng is accused of misrepresenting Huawei's control over technology company Skycom in a presentation to HSBC, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.

Both she and Huawei deny the allegations.

Addario says the evidence is an affidavit from an accountant that details credit facilities and loans issued by HSBC to Huawei subsidiaries and suggests there was never a risk of loss.

Addario also told the court that evidence provided by the United States in the case against Meng is unreliable because it includes a 2017 loan that wasn't connected to HSBC.

""There never was any risk the bank could incur a loss,'"" Addario told the judge.

""The court needs accurate evidence about the loans and credit facilities.""

Crown lawyer Robert Frater urged Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes not to accept the introduction of the proposed evidence.

The Crown argues that actual loss does not need to be shown in order to prove that a fraud took place.

The judge also appeared to have doubts about the defence arguments, asking Addario whether the process of loaning money in itself carried an inherent risk.

The extradition proceedings are scheduled to continue on Wednesday with extensive arguments about the actions of Canadian authorities at the time of Meng's arrest at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018.

The defence claims that Meng's rights were violated because she was interviewed by Canada Border Services Agency officers for three hours without a lawyer, despite a warrant that called for her ""immediate arrest.""","Meng is accused of misrepresenting Huawei's control over technology company Skycom in a presentation to HSBC, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.

HSBC closed its main office in Hong Kong until further notice on Tuesday after three people working there tested positive for COVID-19.

The region's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) published a formal notice asking people who spent more than two hours in the building between March 3 and 16 to be tested at a government-approved center by March 19, according to an internal memo HSBC sent to staff on Wednesday seen by Bloomberg.

The new infections followed a COVID-19 outbreak last Thursday at a gym in Sai Ying Pun, which has spread to the region's financial district.

The CHP said Tuesday it was investigating 18 additional confirmed infections of the virus, taking the total number of cases in Hong Kong to date to 11,340.

The CHP also extended the current social distancing measures until March 31.

""It is our understanding that HMB can return to normal business when virus testing of colleagues and deep cleaning of the facility are complete,"" HSBC said in the memo. ""The exact timing is yet to be confirmed.""

Around 30,000 HSBC employees now have no access to the lender's flagship office, located at 1 Queen's Road Central, in the center of Hong Kong's business district.

Guards wearing masks, face shields and protective clothing were standing in front of the building's entrances and a poster stuck on the door told customers to visit another HSBC branch in the local area, Bloomberg reported.

Insider approached HSBC for comment but did not immediately receive a reply.

A spokeswoman from the bank told Bloomberg that HSBC was following advice from health authorities and taking the necessary steps so the building can reopen when it's safe.

""For banking services, we have well-developed contingency measures that ensure our services and critical processes continue to be maintained,"" she said.

Hong Kong, with a population of 7.5 million, has kept coronavirus cases low thanks to strict contact tracing, testing and quarantine measures. There have been 203 deaths in the city, according to the CHP data.

Looking at the month of December, losses more than tripled to £18,090,154 in 2020 up from £5,821,840 in 2019.

Investment scams included advertisements for bonds that may look like genuine offerings from a bank or financial services provider but are actually fake products.

Why HSBC is saying 'au revoir' to the bulk of its business in France

HSBC's two-decade adventure in France appears to be nearing its conclusion.

Cerberus, the US private equity giant, is - according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) - in pole position to buy HSBC's loss-making French arm and merge it with its own business in the country, My Money Group, which it bought from General Electric in 2017.

The WSJ quoted a memo from Jean Beunardeau, chief executive of HSBC France, as saying a sale would include HSBC's French retail banking and wealth management operations - but not its insurance and asset management operations.

HSBC's French arm has 800,000 customers in the country, employs nearly 10,000 people and has some 230 bank branches.

It also has a number of big sponsorship and partnership deals in the country. It has been an enthusiastic supporter of golf in France for more than a decade and, for the last five years, has also sponsored an annual rugby sevens tournament in Paris.

The bank also has a long-standing relationship with La Cite de le Reussite (the city of success), a debating forum that takes place at the Sorbonne, one of Paris's most famous educational establishments.

The fate of Mr Beunardeau, a former official at the French finance ministry who is said to have impeccable connections in government, is unclear. Previously head of HSBC's global banking and markets operations in France, he became chief executive of the business in January 2012.

A sale would bring to an end a process that has been under way for more than a year.

Mr Beunardeau told the bank's six unions in September 2019 that a strategic review of the business was underway. The previous year, HSBC's retail banking and wealth management business in France lost $56m, up from a loss of $12m in 2017.

A formal sale process was launched in December that year with the banking arm of La Poste, the publicly-listed but government-controlled French postal operator, named as an early possible buyer. Societe Generale, the third largest bank in France by market capitalisation after BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole, was also said to be in the running at one point.

However, finding a buyer has proved difficult, with most French lenders looking to cut the size of their branch banking operations - in response to changing customer behaviour - rather than taking on more branches.

The profitability of the banking sector in France, as with other countries in the eurozone, has been crushed by negative interest rates. Lenders right across the continent, such as Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank, have also been grappling with legacy issues of their own.

In the case of HSBC, the bank also has very specific reasons for seeking an exit from France. The lender is looking to pivot away from Europe and the United States, where its loss-making branch banking business is already up for sale, in order to sharpen its focus on its traditional market of Asia.

Noel Quinn, the chief executive, said at last month's results presentation that the bank would move ""the heart of the business to Asia, including leadership"".

The bank also admitted that it expected to make a loss on the sale.

It all seemed so different when, in April 2000, HSBC entered France with the £6.6bn takeover of Credit Commercial de France.

CCF, founded in 1894, was at the time only the eighth-largest bank in France with some 650 branches - but, with more than one million wealthy clients, it was certainly the country's most profitable.

At the time, it was the biggest ever takeover of a French business by a British one, with Sir John Bond, HSBC's chairman at the time, enthusing about the prospects.

He said: ""This acquisition represents a unique opportunity to build a platform in the eurozone, where we have been under-represented. It will also significantly increase our wealth management business…and expand our ability to meet the needs of our global corporate and institutional clients.""

At the time, eyebrows were raised about the price HSBC was paying, which was more than three times book value.

HSBC said this could be justified by the quality of CCF's business. But Sir John - the architect of a busy period of flag-planting in which HSBC sought to establish itself as 'the world's local bank' - underestimated the hostility of wealthy French banking customers to foreign owners.

CCF was the first French lender to be taken over by a foreign bank and, right from the off, it was having to defend itself for selling out.

Charles de Croisset, the bank's president at the time, told French radio that he did not see ""where the taboo is"". He added: ""It is truly a very beautiful offer.""

Image: HSBC has its headquarters in London

Mr de Croisset was right about that - so far as his shareholders were concerned - because, within a few years it became clear that HSBC had overpaid. CCF was renamed HSBC France in 2005 and, while profits were grown, this was largely achieved by raising charges and by cost cutting.

The quality of service, in the eyes of the bank's notoriously demanding customers, was said to have deteriorated. The formerly well-heeled customers of CCF voted with their feet.

One of them, the heiress Leone-Noelle Meyer, former chairwoman of Galeries Lafayette - the most famous department store in Paris - even sued HSBC France over the loss of €7.5m that had been invested in a fund that had funnelled money to the jailed fraudster Bernie Madoff.

The rot, as locals saw it, was typified by a sale-and-leaseback deal with Qatari investors in 2009 involving the bank's prestigious headquarters on the Champs Elysees. HSBC France vacated the building altogether just under 18 months ago.

There were also other asset sales around the business. HSBC banked a €1.5bn profit when, in March 2008, it offloaded its seven regional French banks. So the business Cerberus is in talks to buy is very much a shrivelled version of the grand old establishment HSBC acquired 21 years ago.

HSBC's experience in France is emblematic of the bank's story of the last few decades - one of hubristic expansion into a new market, over-paying along the way, only to find that prospects for the business were not as great as it first imagined.

There are numerous other examples dating all the way back to the bank's first acquisition of a stake in Marine Midland, the US lender, 40 years ago. It is tempting to speculate how much better HSBC would have done had it chosen to concentrate on growing in its home markets in Asia.","Why HSBC is saying 'au revoir' to the bulk of its business in FranceHSBC is preparing to exit the bulk of its business in France.

Cecilia Chan

She says asset owners have become savvier in understanding the types of strategies they need for long-term tactical asset allocation.

“Our institutional clients’ request were very generic in the past. For example, they only demand aggregated global bonds for their fixed income allocation,” Chan says in an interview with Asia Asset Management. “But their investment needs are now more specific. Some clients look for specific bond types such as Asian high-yield. They may find such credits better suited for their asset allocation objectives.”

This, she says, has prompted the asset manager to develop customised portfolios comprising different investment strategies to meet the investment targets and risk profiles of clients.

Meanwhile, Chan says the buying spree that started after the market slump in the first quarter of last year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic began to slow down in late 2020, as some investors fretted that assets had become overvalued, and were wary of economic uncertainties such as reflation risks.

She expects the tapering off of institutional flows to persist through 2021 amid volatile market conditions, although individual markets such as China which have been able to better control the pandemic may be able to draw more institutional money.

She notes that the pandemic has led investors to invest more into technology and innovative sectors such as healthcare and e-commerce. She says investors have to be “more price sensitive and more nimble for portfolio rebalancing”.

Chan was named the Asia Pacific CIO in February after her predecessor Bill Maldonado announced he was leaving the company. She was previously the fixed income CIO.

One of the largest U.S. investment banks, Morgan Stanley, will be offering its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America’s wealth management divisions do not currently allow their advisors to offer direct investment in bitcoin funds.

Morgan Stanley to Offer Wealth Clients Access to Bitcoin Funds

Investment bank Morgan Stanley, with $4 trillion in client assets, has become the “first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds,” CNBC reported Wednesday.

The firm reportedly told its financial advisors in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that allow exposure to bitcoin, the publication conveyed, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. According to the people, clients have been demanding exposure to the cryptocurrency, adding:

Clients can likely make investments as early as next month, after the bank’s financial advisors complete training courses tied to the new offerings.

Two of the bitcoin funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital: the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund LP and the Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP. The third is FS NYDIG Select Fund, a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG). The latter is the bitcoin investment arm of Stone Ridge Asset Management. Two of the funds have minimum investments of $25,000, but Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has a $5 million minimum.

The funds are only available to clients of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division and investments are restricted to 2.5% of the client’s total net worth, the sources revealed. Clients must have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm with “an aggressive risk tolerance” to qualify, whereas investment firms need at least $5 million at the bank.

The wealth management divisions of other major U.S. investment banks — Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America — do not currently allow their advisors to offer direct investment in bitcoin funds, the news outlet noted.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz and NYDIG both tweeted that they are thrilled “to partner with Morgan Stanley, the first US bank to offer access to bitcoin for their wealth management clients.”

Bitcoiners welcome this move by Morgan Stanley, praising the investment bank for its contribution in making bitcoin more mainstream. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor wrote, “Morgan Stanley is the first bank to offer bitcoin, they won’t be the last.” Economist Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, commented: “Today is the day the big banks entered bitcoin.” Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano opined:

Galaxy Digital and NYDIG will both be onboarding millions of people to bitcoin via the largest US brokerage. Morgan Stanley is in the game. Bitcoin is inevitable.

“For speculative investment opportunities to rise to the level of an investable asset class that can play a role in diversified investment portfolios requires transformational progress on both the supply and demand sides.” It stated.

“With cryptocurrency, we think that threshold is being reached. A firming regulatory framework, deepening liquidity, availability of products and growing investor interest—especially among institutional investors—have coalesced.”

The note concluded by stating that cryptocurrency trading remains “in its infancy”, before stating that the bank is “yet to be convinced” and that it advises clients to proceed with caution.

In a research note issued Thursday, analysts Praveen Choudhary, Gareth Leung and Thomas Allen note that multiple circumstances will work in the favor of operators next year, with the number of hotel rooms in Macau’s gaming center of Cotai due to rise 13% thanks to openings at SJM’s Grand Lisboa Palace and Galaxy Entertainment Group’s Galaxy Macau Phase 3.

Notably, with Sands China’s The Londoner Macao focusing on quality over quantity, ultra-high-end hotel rooms will be up 59%, “delivering higher premium mass revenue,” Morgan Stanley said.

Rising revenues, driven by a 22% increase in China nominal GDP, will also be complemented by lower operating costs, estimated to remain 4% lower in 2022 than they were three years earlier. As a result, Morgan Stanley estimates Macau-wide Property EBITDA of US$11 billion in 2022 – 11% higher than market consensus and 15% higher than 2019.

Morgan Stanley,2,coinspeaker.com,https://www.coinspeaker.com/morgan-stanley-stake-bithumb/,2021-03-19,Morgan Stanley Is Reportedly Interested in Buying Stake in Bithumb,"The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time.

New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is reportedly interested in acquiring shares in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. As reported by local media channel Aju news, the financial services behemoth is in talks with Bident, a major shareholder of Bithumb who has about a 10% ownership stake.

The decision to give up ownership stakes in Bithumb by its top shareholder, Lee Jung-hoon, takes precedence from the probe of authorities into the exchange’s financials, a situation that led to successive raids on the firms operating base by the South Korean Police in 2020. With Lee’s more than 40% stake up for grabs, various companies, both home and abroad had been making their intentions known.

One of the alleged early bidders, a South Korean-Japanese video game publisher Nexon Co Ltd (TYO: 3659) has refuted all media claims linking him to the acquisition deal, valued at $460 million. The intentions by Morgan Stanley according to the reports citing sources familiar with the matter are based on laying out an offer to Bident whose lower stake will prompt it to be open to favorable negotiations.

According to the reports, Morgan Stanley is pursuing only flexible options and is open to either helping Bident to increase its stake or to buy-out the firm’s holdings with a planned investment of between 300 and 500 billion Korean won ($254 million to $441 million).

“The reason Morgan Stanley used Bident is that it understood that Bident has the right to negotiate a preferred sale to acquire Bithumb Holdings,” said one of the anonymous sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Cointelegraph.

Morgan Stanley amid the Bithumb Push

The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time. The Bithumb exchange acquisition report is the sequel to the news break about the bank’s proposed product to give access to its rich clients to invest in and own Bitcoin directly through three Bitcoin funds.

While neither Morgan Stanley nor Bithumb has confirmed the show of interest from the former, the ownership bid is undoubtedly in line with the bank’s latest agenda to take the bull by the horn and help ride the cryptocurrency race on its journey to mainstream adoption.

The entire cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, with enough room for growth, and according to a recent report from German multinational investment bank and financial services company, Deutsche Bank AG (ETR: DBK), Bitcoin’s $1 trillion market capitalization has made it difficult to ignore the burgeoning asset class, and by extension, the host of other emerging altcoins out there.

The bid for Bithumb, per Market analyst Joseph Young, places the company at a $2 billion valuation.","The growing demand for digital currency products from institutional investors is rising, and major US banks including Morgan Stanley hope to catch the train on time.
New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is reportedly interested in acquiring shares in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb.
As reported by local media channel Aju news, the financial services behemoth is in talks with Bident, a major shareholder of Bithumb who has about a 10% ownership stake.

The New York-based bank donated $134,500 to federal candidates and fundraising committees for candidates in February, including Democratic chair of the House Financial Services Committee and anti-bank critic Maxine Waters, as well as her Republican counterpart Patrick McHenry.

No donation was made to any of the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying U.S. President Joe Biden's electoral votes, the Federal Election Commission filing showed on Friday.

Some Republican House members who voted to impeach former U.S. President Donald Trump, such as Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Anthony Gonzalez among others, did receive donations from the bank.

On Jan. 6, a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an attempt to overrun his defeat against Biden in the presidential elections, resulting in a riot with multiple deaths.

Morgan Stanley joined the ranks of numerous other companies on Jan. 10 to say it would halt its PAC donations and review them in the meantime.

The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold."" Read more: What Happens When Tycoons Abandon Their Own Giant Cargo ShipsThe industry says it is the responsibility of ship owners to arrange crew changes and to ensure the safety and well-being of the seafarers on their vessels. BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.

Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.
“We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway.
Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners.

Nomura analysts Tushar Mohata and Alpa Aggarwal revised their estimates downwards in a research note published early Wednesday morning in which they pointed to the fact that Genting Malaysia’s UK properties will remain closed until at least 17 May under the government’s reopening schedule, and predicted ongoing losses for Resorts World Bimini in the Bahamas and Resorts World Catskills in New York.

They also noted that earnings at flagship Malaysia property Resorts World Genting will be impacted in 1Q21 by its recent one month closure and could be impacted further pending the country’s ever-changing COVID situation. 2Q21 earnings should improve, however, led by vaccination progress.

Nevertheless, Mohata and Aggarwal have revised down their 2021 estimates by 10% with revenue now forecast at around MYR6.32 billion (US$1.54 billion), down from an earlier estimate of MYR7.05 billion (US$1.71 billion). An estimated profit of MYR286 million (US$70 million) has also been revised down to MYR184 million.

More positive is the impending mid-2021 launch of RWG’s Skyworlds theme park, with Nomura noting that the hiring of staff is now well underway.

“We believe investors will overlook near-term bumpy earnings and are looking through to FY22F prospects, which look promising for Malaysia with the Skyworlds theme park scheduled to open,” the analysts said.

“We believe that 1Q21 earnings from Malaysian operations will be impacted due to ~1 month closure of the resort due to the movement control order. However, given the reopening since then, and progressive ramp-up of vaccination, revenue/EBITDA momentum should improve thereafter, in our view.

“There remains a possibility that any future wave of COVID-19 infections might impact visitation again later in 2021, but the risks of this happening will dissipate as vaccination ramps up in 2H21.”

The title’s creative director talked about its ambitions, gameplay, and even revealed that there will be a job system. We have translated a summary of the interview below.

Square Enix announced the new game in the Final Fantasy VII universe in February 2021 would be a battle royale title for mobile devices. Set 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII proper, Nomura confirmed that The First Soldier will affect the story of another upcoming mobile title, Final Fantasy Ever Crisis.

Famitsu started the interview by asking the Nomura who the target audience is with Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier. He responded,

“Fanbases of long-standing IPs—not just Final Fantasy VII—become static to a degree. So our challenge is to appeal to other fanbases.”

Nomura also said he feels strongly that the team cannot rest on the laurels of Final Fantasy VII‘s legacy. So they are developing Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier intending to get into the most popular game genre at the moment. He hopes the Battle Royale title will be a catalyst for those unfamiliar with the Final Fantasy series to get interested in the expanded universe of Final Fantasy VII.

In terms of game systems, Nomura confirmed new details based on the footage we’ve seen so far. He stated that Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier will likely have a job system called “Styles.” (Please note that this phrase could change in the official localization.) The icons on the screen indicate what special skills the player can use based on their Style, which they can change for each battle. Additionally, Nomura confirmed that there will be a closed beta test, with details coming in the future.

When asked about what the team is focusing on, Nomura brought up gameplay and stated the importance of game-feel and balancing. In this regard, Nomura said that Producer Shoichi Ichikawa is a hardcore battle royale player, so his feedback has been very helpful. When Nomura introduces an idea, Ichikawa can tell him how it will affect the title’s balance and openly inform Nomura when he’s “spouting nonsense.” Additionally, Nomura said the team is polishing up the game’s visuals so it doesn’t disappoint anyone for being a mobile title.

Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier will release on iOS and Android devices in 2021.","During an interview with Famitsu, Tetsuya Nomura confirmed new details about the upcoming mobile game, Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier.

The Nomura India Business Resumption Index dipped to 95.1 for the week to March 21 from 95.4 in the previous week as a result of the rising infections, the brokerage said.

COVID-19 infections are rising to new heights across the country and many local governments have been forced to re-introduce stricter measures like night-time curfews and sealing off premises in order to contain the spread.

“The pandemic's second wave is now spreading to states outside Maharashtra and is starting to impact mobility. This suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization,"" it said.

The brokerage added that it expects the impact to be “more transitory and muted"", as factory operations remain uninterrupted, consumers and businesses have adapted to the new normal and medium-term tailwinds like vaccinations, global growth, easy financial conditions continue.

It said as of mid-March, Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility fell by 3.7 percentage points on a week-on-week basis and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while the more updated Apple driving index fell by 2.6 percentage points.

However, power demand improved by 2.6 per cent week-on-week after a 0.6 per cent decline the prior week, while the labour participation rate inched up to 40.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent.

The knock-on effect of the second wave on mobility suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization, it said.

The medium-term tailwinds from the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, fiscal activism, strong global growth and continuing vaccine momentum will support real GDP growth of 13.5 per cent in FY22, up from a contraction of 7.4 per cent in FY21, it said. PTI AA ANU ANU

Nomura banking group says there is “limited room” in the near term for casino investor Genting Malaysia Bhd to realise “further capital injections” into Empire Resorts Inc, an associated that runs Resorts World Catskills (pictured), in upstate New York in the United States. But a further capital injection could be done after September, without the need for a minority shareholder vote, added the institution.

Genting Malaysia Bhd said in a Friday filing it had agreed to subscribe for up to US$20 million of “Series L” preferred stock in Empire Resorts. The latter company became in 2019 an associate of Genting Malaysia and vehicles held by Genting’s controlling Malaysian dynasty, the Lim family.

Nomura suggested in a Monday note that related-party transactions – such as the Empire Resorts capital injection – “above an aggregate value of 5 percent of net book value of Genting Malaysia, done cumulatively over a rolling 12-month period, will need a minority shareholder vote.”

The brokerage stated that due to the “lower book value” of Genting Malaysia after fiscal-year 2020 losses, “the aggregate of Empire capital injections (in September 2020 and March 2021) now amounts to 4.8 percent” of the casino operator’s book value.

That suggested “limited room for further capital injections in the near term till September 2021, unless shareholder approval is sought,” wrote analysts Tushar Mohata and Alpa Aggarwal.

Genting Malaysia – promoter of Resorts World Genting, Malaysia’s only licensed casino complex – said in its Friday filing that the proceeds from the subscription to Empire Resorts’ stock would be used to “close Empire’s short-term refinancing plan for its debts totalling US$350 million, maturing on 23 March 2021”.

In Monday’s memo, Nomura said it believed Empire Resorts would “attempt to conclude the refinancing” of Resorts World Catskills’ long-term borrowings “in the meantime, as its operating outlook improves with progress in U.S. vaccination” programmes.

“Should there be a delay in refinancing till September 2021, there can theoretically be a further US$140 million capital injection in Empire by Genting Malaysia some time around October 2021, based on our calculations, without seeking a minority vote,” added the Nomura team.

It added: “It is imperative, in our view, that Empire secures financing soon at attractive interest rates if it is to turn profitable, lest Genting Malaysia have to shoulder further recapitalisation.”

The Resorts World Genting casino complex – Genting Malaysia’s main revenue generator – resumed operations on February 16, after being closed for more than three weeks as a Covid-19 countermeasure, due to a spike in infections in Malaysia.","GEN Malaysia further inputs to Empire possible: NomuraNomura banking group says there is “limited room” in the near term for casino investor Genting Malaysia Bhd to realise “further capital injections” into Empire Resorts Inc, an associated that runs Resorts World Catskills (pictured), in upstate New York in the United States.

Nomura,4,ptleader.com,"https://www.ptleader.com/stories/port-changes-lease-with-skookum-for-nomura-building,74259",2021-03-19,Port changes lease with Skookum for Nomura Building,"Posted Thursday, March 18, 2021 9:35 am

Port of Port Townsend Commissioners voted to terminate a lease with Skookum Educational Programs and authorized port officials to seek a replacement lease which would allow the port to rent out other portions of the building that are currently occupied by Skookum.

Port Commissioners Bill Putney, Pam Petranek and Pete Hanke all expressed their reticence in voting for the resolution.

“I’ve had some fairly extensive conversations with Eron [Berg] and Eric [Toews],” Putney said at the March 10 meeting. “While I feel it is not necessarily ideal, it is a good, supportable compromise position.”

“I agree, I feel the same way, Bill,” Petranek added. “It’s a good compromise.”

The change to the lease comes after the port entered into a 30-year building lease with the group in 1995.

As part of the lease, rent was set at $3,400 per month, but included a provision that allowed for the port to receive landscaping maintenance, litter removal, bulk mailing and other services from the company in lieu of cash payments for the rent.

In 2018, port staff brought the issue to the attention of the Washington State Auditor’s Office, which later issued a letter recommending that the port improve controls to ensure it is adequately compensated for leased properties.

As part of the new lease, Skookum will now occupy 2,139 square feet on the ground floor. This is a significant reduction from using the overall footprint of about 8,600 square feet.

Under the new lease, for the first five years Skookum will pay 25 percent of the market rate for the space, with a 2.5 percent annual escalator. Starting

April 1, 2021, Skookum will pay $892.69, escalating to $985.34 through March 31, 2026.

If Skookum wishes to extend the lease for an additional five-year term, it will be paying $2,019.94 per month in 2027, rising to $3,428.14 by 2031.

Port officials noted that early termination of the lease and its potential replacement would bring the port in line with recommendations made by the state auditor.

The port is currently in the process of working with the Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding to rent building space on the eastern half of the ground floor of the building.

The Port of Port Townsend estimates there will be a $5,000 price tag for worker time and materials to partition the building for its future tenants.","Posted Thursday, March 18, 2021 9:35 amPort of Port Townsend Commissioners voted to terminate a lease with Skookum Educational Programs and authorized port officials to seek a replacement lease which would allow the port to rent out other portions of the building that are currently occupied by Skookum.

The Nomura India Business Resumption Index dipped to 95.1 for the week to March 21 from 95.4 in the previous week as a result of the rising infections, the brokerage said.

COVID-19 infections are rising to new heights across the country and many local governments have been forced to re-introduce stricter measures like night-time curfews and sealing off premises in order to contain the spread.

“The pandemic's second wave is now spreading to states outside Maharashtra and is starting to impact mobility. This suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization,"" it said.

The brokerage added that it expects the impact to be “more transitory and muted"", as factory operations remain uninterrupted, consumers and businesses have adapted to the new normal and medium-term tailwinds like vaccinations, global growth, easy financial conditions continue.

It said as of mid-March, Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility fell by 3.7 percentage points on a week-on-week basis and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while the more updated Apple driving index fell by 2.6 percentage points.

However, power demand improved by 2.6 per cent week-on-week after a 0.6 per cent decline the prior week, while the labour participation rate inched up to 40.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent.

The knock-on effect of the second wave on mobility suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization, it said.

The medium-term tailwinds from the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, fiscal activism, strong global growth and continuing vaccine momentum will support real GDP growth of 13.5 per cent in FY22, up from a contraction of 7.4 per cent in FY21, it said. PTI AA ANU ANU

Its official institutions group has nurtured long-term relationships, offering a suite of services tailored to address both new and old challenges facing central banks. Yet a common root for its solid growth traces back to the relationships created by Fischer, Francis, Trees & Watts (FFT&W), the US investment management firm BNP Paribas acquired in 2006.

The acquisition bestowed BNP Paribas with improved expertise on mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a key alternative asset class for central banks seeking to reap higher yields while limiting their risk exposures. The ability to secure returns while managing the complex risks of the MBS market attracted international clients that remain attached to BNP Paribas to this day. Added to this is a strong focus on training – an offering the asset manager has been quick to adapt to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, developing new online options.

The asset manager is also committed to educating central banks about the opportunities offered by environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment, offering a path to adopt these principles in the management of foreign exchange portfolios. This has contributed to boosting assets under management, resulting in BNP Paribas Asset Management being a top-five central bank asset manager by the end of 2019, according to Pension & Investments.

Work with the Czech National Bank showcases the way BNP Paribas has served the central banking community over the past few decades.

“Our relationship goes a long time back, to the 1990s, when we worked with FFT&W,” says Jan Schmidt, executive director of risk management at the CNB. Both parties reinforced their link in November 2019 with a new $500 million MBS mandate. However, securing it was far from a foregone conclusion for the French group. The selection process was highly competitive. In total, more than a dozen asset managers competed for four mandates of the same size, among them major US firms. Schmidt says the investments ran by BNP Paribas were well-managed during the liquidity squeeze in March 2020.

Tailor-made for central banks

“It has been more than a year since the mandate was put in place, and BNP Paribas Asset Management has proved its top position when it comes to delivering both the financial performance and also fulfilling its other commitments in our contract,” says Schmidt.

Beyond a competitive return performance, one key advantage highlighted by BNP Paribas’s clients is its flexibility to address specific requests.

“In this MBS mandate, we required the asset manager to provide us with customised reporting. We asked them to directly connect our accounting system with them,” says Schmidt.

“We spent almost a year working on the reporting lines, and BNP Paribas was the first out of these four managers to establish the reporting line, exactly according to what we required during the tender.”

This ability to cater to central banks’ specific needs stems from the group having official institutions embedded in its DNA, says the head of reserve management at a central bank with assets exceeding $250 billion.

“One indication of this is that the CEO of BNP Paribas Asset Management USA, Johanna Lasker, is also the head of official institutions,” the official tells Central Banking. “That really shows you the thinking and the sensitivity to official institutions.”

Other asset managers tend to serve their central bank clients through their in-country delegation.

“These departments serve several pension funds, maybe a sovereign wealth fund, but just one central bank. If, instead, you have an official institutions group such as BNP Paribas, which serves dozens of institutions like ours around the world, they are really aware of our needs as a central bank,” says the reserve manager at the central bank with assets of more than $250 billion.

“Sometimes, training might be helpful. On other occasions, you just need a staff member to come over and address a specific problem. They’re willing to show you what to do to get you educated.”

BNP Paribas’s commitment to the community is not only limited to larger, more profitable institutions. Take the Central Bank of Aruba, an institution serving a Dutch island in the Caribbean with barely more than 100,000 people. The initial connection between the two parties also stems from FFT&W, a relationship that has slowly thrived until now becoming full-fledged partners.

“Even when they weren’t our official asset managers, they still came to the bank and made presentations,” says the president of the Central Bank of Aruba, Jeanette Semeleer.

“When we needed advice, we could count on them – so this relationship started on a non-formal basis a long time ago. I must say they invested time in it.”

Now, the French institution manages a fixed income mandate in US dollars with a short duration of one to two years for the Caribbean central bank. It is a demanding portfolio that includes an income target with restrictive risk parameters. Managing public, scarce, key financial resources for the island, BNP Paribas constantly needs to balance returns and capital preservation with little margin for error.

Partly due to the low-yield environment that followed the financial crisis, the Caribbean central bank has invested in staff specialised in risk management over the past few years. This has allowed it to better communicate its risk guidelines to BNP Paribas, and securely reap higher returns by adding corporate bonds to its portfolio. In November 2020, the central bank’s reserve portfolio stood at almost Afl1.9 billion ($1.1 billion) in foreign exchange assets, according to official data. This was up from Afl1.4 billion in 2016.

“For us, it’s very important to trust these people – trust their knowledge and their judgement. Although we are a small central bank, we demand timely reports and they comply,” says Semeleer.

“They’re an extension of our operations, and we have very high standards in terms of risk management. So far, they have been able to comply, not only in terms of managing the risk and our risk appetite and understanding our needs, but also working within our budget.”

The track record BNP Paribas has built over the years also allowed it to weather the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the challenging environment, it was able to on-board new central bank mandates and work closely with central banks that were making significant asset allocation changes while working remotely.

During this challenging year, “clients demonstrated great flexibility and continued to make changes to their asset allocation by introducing new sectors to their reserve management programmes”, Lasker tells Central Banking.

Sustainable investment

BNP Paribas has also taken a leadership role in its approach towards sustainable investment after publishing its global sustainability strategy in 2019. This encompasses ESG integration and plenty of proprietary research.

“We rate and score more than 12,000 corporate issuers on ESG performance, and we also have an ESG scoring framework on sovereigns,” says Jane Ambachtsheer, global head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

“We have an aim to beat the benchmark on both ESG and carbon for those strategies that have an investable benchmark, and are in the process of integrating this into our client reporting.”

The reserve manager at the central bank with assets exceeding $250 billion says the French asset manager “has a huge database of companies on ESG compliance”, and adds: “Currently, we don’t have an ESG mandate with them, but the way they report to us on this field is very sophisticated.”

As with other investment areas, these ESG capabilities are tailored to every central bank client. The Central Bank of Aruba – based in a jurisdiction highly exposed to climate-change risks – is currently formulating its new strategy in this area, including climate-change policies and the greening of its investment portfolios.

“BNP Paribas has worked very closely with our team to help us understand the possibilities at our disposal,” says the central bank’s Semeleer. “It’s not easy, because we still need to maximise our investments. We need to carve out a green policy that would allow us to still make some money.”

As the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe and the US, it set off a liquidity crisis that could have spiralled out of control. While central banks acted as liquidity providers of last resort, some of their commercial counterparts also stepped up to offer critical market-making and other services to assist official-sector clients.

Joe Squires, BNP

The corporate and institutional banking unit of BNP Paribas drew particular praise from central bank clients across a wide range of geographic regions and business areas – notably in fixed income, cash and repo products, foreign exchange trading and gold swaps – during this time of heightened market tension.

BNP Paribas kept making markets through the heat of the Covid-19 crisis, and was “willing to deploy” its balance sheet, according to Joe Squires, co-head of G10 rates for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Emea). To take one example, the bank’s repo and securities lending activity with central banks in Europe saw a 30% increase in volume. One central bank client describes BNP Paribas as an “important partner” for securities lending services.

Its commitment to the sector is no accident. BNP Paribas has spent decades building its relationships with central banks. It set up a dedicated official institutions coverage team, which now comprises 25 staff, 15 years ago. Laurent Leveque, global head of official institutions coverage, says the team has strong support from senior managers, including chairman Jean Lemierre (the former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). BNP Paribas now works with 90 central banks, and counts more than 250 institutions among its official-sector clients, Leveque tells Central Banking.

All that glistens …

One area where BNP Paribas particularly shone during the Covid-19 crisis was gold. “We continued to provide significant liquidity to our official-sector counterparties to help them manage maturing transactions on gold swaps, with gold often delivered back to us due to market conditions, and we provided the liquidity needed, without disruption, in the London and Zurich markets in particular,” explains Davide Collini, head of Emea metals.

A reserve manager at a major central bank in Europe says his institution was able to benefit from these favourable market conditions. Working with BNP Paribas, the central bank conducted many gold market operations during March and April, taking advantage of gold market conditions and huge demand for dollar liquidity worldwide to generate additional returns.

BNP Paribas is historically one of our best market counterparts Reserve manager at a major central bank in Europe

The central banker adds that BNP Paribas has also worked with his team on a new gold project, although the details currently remain under wraps. “BNP Paribas is historically one of our best market counterparts,” says the reserve official.

Bond markets have been central in terms of central bank responses to the crisis in 2020, and here, too, BNP Paribas was well-positioned. It has been an active participant in the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), and has also been a leader when it comes to supporting governments with their Covid financing. As well as holding 25 primary dealerships worldwide, the bank was ranked top for its work on structuring Covid-related bond issuances in the year to September 2020, according to data from Dealogic.

Delphine Queniart, BNP

Green finance is another area of strength for the French bank – and a topic that is rapidly growing in importance for central banks worldwide. BNP Paribas was involved in structuring several innovative bond issuances, and has helped central banks to invest during the past few years, says Delphine Queniart, global head of sustainable finance. An example was the three-year sustainable development bond issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in June – central banks ultimately bought 76% of the 3 billion renminbi ($460 million) issuance.

BNP Paribas also participated in the issuance of the European Union’s Sure (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) instrument, comprising €100 billion ($121 billion) of loans from the EU to member states struggling with the effects of the pandemic. Central banks bought 37% of the 10-year tranche, says Queniart: “This is the result of intensive work from all our teams to support the European Union in this landmark transaction.”

The preparatory work and commitment to the official sector has helped bolster income. The bank’s global markets revenues rose 63.5% year on year in the second quarter of 2020, with fixed income, currencies and commodity revenues up 154%, reflecting frantic bond issuance by sovereigns to fund measures to combat the health crisis, as well as rapid reallocations in the portfolios of institutional clients, including major central banks.

Laurent Leveque, BNP

BNP Paribas also has a trusted research role in green finance and on other matters relating to investment. It advises major central banks on green finance, and Queniart says the goal is to play a “leadership” role in scaling up sustainable finance markets. On broader research, one of the firm’s clients says there is a “very good relationship” between Leveque’s team and reserve managers.

The French bank has also grown its share in US markets and elsewhere, while remaining a top counterparty for euro activities. A European central banker points to a new, securities lending mandate denominated in US dollars that was awarded to BNP Paribas in the past year, adding that the French dealer is one of the central bank’s “more active” counterparties in both dollars and euros. The official notes that BNP Paribas also offers renminbi services, unlike many other counterparties.

BNP Paribas is committed to offering services to central bank clients across the ‘full value chain’ of global markets, from trading to finance, in addition to asset management and securities services. Its credentials underwent a tough real-world stress test in the past year, and the bank ultimately delivered on its promise to stand by central banks throughout the turbulence.

(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold."" Read more: What Happens When Tycoons Abandon Their Own Giant Cargo ShipsThe industry says it is the responsibility of ship owners to arrange crew changes and to ensure the safety and well-being of the seafarers on their vessels. BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak.
“We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway.
Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners.
“Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends.

When Yann Gérardin was toiling away on the fringes of the dealing room at pre-merger Banque Nationale de Paris, putting together an equity derivatives desk in the late 1980s, the prospect of being able to deploy a full-service equities franchise must have seemed far away. But now, as deputy chief operating officer of BNP Paribas and head of its corporate and institutional bank, he is about to preside over a radical change that he thinks will transform how the firm transacts with its equities clients.

In its full-year earnings for 2020, BNPP said it would “accelerate the development of its equity businesses with the roll-out of a broader prime services offering and the strengthening of cooperation with Exane BNP Paribas”. Now the bank has revealed just what that means. On March 11 it announced that it would buy out the half of its equities partnership with Exane that it does not already own for an undisclosed sum.

In doing so the bank is bringing to an end an arrangement that was first mooted in late 2003 and formally launched in April 2004. But the move also marks a vote of confidence by the bank in its ability to make a full-service equities franchise work at a time when European investment banks are struggling to justify the effort involved.
