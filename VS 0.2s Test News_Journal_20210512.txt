REUTERS/Mike SegarBy Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Brexit forced Britain to relinquish 2.3 trillion pounds ($3.25 trillion) in monthly derivatives trading, leaving New York the global winner in a shake-up of that market, consultants Deloitte and data company IHS Markit said in a report on Tuesday.Britain left the European Union's full legal orbit on Dec. 31 and the UK financial sector's access to the bloc is now limited.Banks and other market participants in the EU are no longer allowed to use platforms in London to trade swaps, while Brussels has given the United States permission to serve EU investors.Initial figures in January showed that chunks of trading in interest rate swaps left London for EU and US platforms, and the report on Tuesday confirmed that trend has become embedded.Market share for euro swaps alone in London fell from just under 40% in July 2020 to about 10% in March, while on EU platforms it rose from 10% to 26%, and in the United States from less than 10% to 19%.

However, other clearinghouses such as Eurex and ICE operate under a vertical model meaning that derivatives traded on their exchanges must be cleared through their own CCPs.The implementation of open access has been hit by several delays. In June, the European Parliament confirmed the regime would be delayed for one year until July 2021 just two weeks before it was due to imposed because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“HM Treasury has concluded that the open access regime for ETDs, which was originally designed to improve cross-border capital markets in the EU, is not suitable in a UK-only context,” said the HM Treasury in its statement.The Treasury added the open access regime will remain in place for equity and over the counter derivatives, and that it will conduct a broader review of the wholesale financial markets to increase future openness and competitiveness.“This ruling further evidence of the negative consequences of the UK leaving the EU. The UK had originally been all for open access, allowing for market participants in exchange traded derivatives the freedom of choice for clearing their contracts,” Vuk Magdelinic, chief executive of Overbond, commented on the development.“With Brexit however, and in spite of the advantages of such a regime across Europe from a free flow-of-capital perspective, the Treasury undoubtedly viewed these to be largely nullified when implemented on a stand-alone national basis.”The decision to remove open access is the latest move in a series of regulatory divergence by the UK away from EU law following Brexit. In April, the UK Chancellor set out ambitious capital markets reforms that included the removal of the double volume caps (DVCs) relating to dark trading and the share trading obligation.While last week it was confirmed that certain research rules and best execution reporting requirements under MiFID II could be axed in the UK.","['derivatives', 'regime', 'divergence', 'uk', 'access', 'eu', 'confirmed', 'treasury', 'trading', 'regulatory', 'markets', 'open', 'scraps', 'latest']",2021-05-07,,thetradenews.com,EUREX
EUREX,0,Google API,https://www.thetradenews.com/clearing-post-brexit-what-happens-now/,Clearing post-Brexit: What happens now? - The TRADE,"A battle for clearingThe battle to win euro-denominated derivatives clearing activity, a business worth some $660 trillion, is one of the fiercest between UK and EU regulators.Currently, London is the home to derivatives clearing, with most of the activity going through LCH.A temporary 18-month equivalence for UK clearing houses was enacted in September 2020, enabling LCH to continue providing euro-denominated clearing services from January 2021 until June 2022.This 25% chunk of euro-derivatives clearing is not a “viable” amount for the EU to process, Bailey explained to MPs.Going forward, the UK and EU will most likely stay in close contact when formulating and implementing financial services regulation.","When the UK and EU announced their last-minute post-Brexit agreement and there was little to no mention of financial services, the eventual divergence on trading regulation was inevitable.Early signs of the UK’s split from EU regulations came last year when the UK Treasury confirmed it would not implement the Settlement Discipline Regime (SDR), set out under the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR).UK Ministers are now reportedly planning to overhaul MiFID II, the EU’s main financial services legislation, as it looks to hold onto its place as a global financial centre. Changes could include scrapping the share trading obligation, which forced more than €6 billion a day of EU-denominated stocks out of London to European-based venues mainly in Amsterdam.With the UK and EU to set out separate paths on financial regulation, there are various implications this could have on the post-trade landscape alongside potential unintended consequences that may arise for firms.A battle for clearingThe battle to win euro-denominated derivatives clearing activity, a business worth some $660 trillion, is one of the fiercest between UK and EU regulators. Currently, London is the home to derivatives clearing, with most of the activity going through LCH. Despite moves from Eurex, the Frankfurt-based exchange group, to lure activity from London, LCH has maintained its hold of the market.A temporary 18-month equivalence for UK clearing houses was enacted in September 2020, enabling LCH to continue providing euro-denominated clearing services from January 2021 until June 2022.However, tensions are heating up between regulators, and it appears equivalence will not be extended beyond 2022. In February, the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey warned over a “serious escalation” in relations with the UK if Brussels attempts to force banks to move all clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the Eurozone.In his speech to the UK Treasury Committee, Bailey highlighted how the consequence of no further equivalence decisions at the end of the 18-month period would mean that a quarter of euro-derivatives clearing would move from the UK to the EU. This 25% chunk of euro-derivatives clearing is not a “viable” amount for the EU to process, Bailey explained to MPs.“The reason is, particularly in an activity like clearing where the efficiency really comes from having a very big pool of derivatives that can be netted and cleared down, by splitting that pool up the whole process becomes less efficient and having the smaller part of the pool would be even less efficient,” he said. “The clearinghouses also involve a certain level of cross-currency netting to go on and that would break down as well.”To obtain the remaining three-quarters of total euro-denominated derivatives activity, Bailey said the EU could potentially “force or cajole banks and dealers to say there will be some other penalty unless you move this clearing activity into the EU”.This, he warned, would create “a very serious escalation of the issue” and was something that the UK should “resist very firmly”. Activity has not yet shifted from the UK, as banks await clarity on what is to come.“The situation is unclear on what will develop after June 2022, and we have clear messages from the Commission to move euro-denominated contracts/products to EU-located CCPs,” says Haroun Boucheta, head of regulatory affairs at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “The industry has pressure from the Commission to work closely on operational solutions to migrate euro business, using EU27 CCPs.”Post-trade fragmentationThe lack of cross-border equivalence for not only clearing, but also settlement of securities, means clear lines have been drawn between UK and European post-trade venues. Banks are concerned about the impact of fragmentation on costs for clearing and settlement.The costs will come from investment firms and banks having to adapt their technology infrastructure to manage a dual post-trade framework. Larger-sized firms may be able to absorb these costs, but it will make barriers to entry for smaller-sized firms even harder to overcome. As a result, some asset managers could be forced to operate in just one jurisdiction.“Firms have broadly adopted a model where you have one system, but you guide the trade processing to different venues, with localised processing funnels,” says Samir Pandiri, president at Broadridge International. “A very small second group are firms who basically decided they didn’t have the scale in either the UK or the Continent to make it worthwhile preparing to continue service in that jurisdiction.“Post-trade solutions need to take into account three variables: trading in multiple geographies, clients in different jurisdictions and where the post-trade processing is actually done. We did a lot of one-off configuration with new client entities since 2016, and that’s all been working well. But the Brexit work is also enabling a broader re-set on post-trade, with providers needing much more flexible/customisable systems to keep competitive.“With trading volumes moving around between venues, post-trade services must now offer much more price flexibility and more variable cost, which will act as a further stimulus to mutualisation. The increased complexity also highlights the necessity of better data models, to spot inefficiencies, such the costs of a fail for example.”Regulatory fragmentationAs outlined, the UK is seeking to overhaul certain European regulations to make itself a more attractive financial services centre. It could appear that the UK is taking a different approach to post-trade regulation, following its decision to not implement the SDR rules. It did, however, state it will consider the future approach of the rules to the UK’s own post-trade framework.The danger here for firms is that regulatory fragmentation could require double the amount of work and resources to stay compliant in both jurisdictions.“With the UK opting out of CSDR, there will be separate regimes around settlement discipline,” highlights Reto Faber, head of direct custody and clearing for EMEA at Citi. “It may look to align with some aspects of CSDR, but right now it looks like there will be a dual system affecting cross-listed shares. This is going to bring additional and duplicated costs, as well as increased complexity to deal with multiple regimes.”That being said, the decision by the UK to implement CSDR differently could provide a glimmer of hope for banks and investment managers that the EU will review its contentious mandatory buy-in regime.“Fragmentation is going to come on a wider scale throughout the year. With the UK implementing SDR separately, the regulation may come back to the table very differently where they could make the buy-in optional rather than mandatory,” says Linda Gibson, head of regulatory change at BNY Mellon’s Pershing.“But the market is waiting on how the UK will implement SDR, causing some operational challenges to firms that are international. Those that have project plans in place are working on the EU regime, so the challenge is to anticipate how different the UK will be.”The European Commission recently closed its consultation of CSDR and is set to publish the findings of its review in the second quarter. Many are hoping European regulators will do away with the buy-in regime (which seems highly unlikely) or implement it on a discretionary basis.As a result, European regulators could opt for more favourable changes so that it is more aligned with the UK.“We have pushed for a voluntary buy-in regime rather than a mandatory one, and specific exemptions in terms of products and operations which should be out of the scope of the SDR,” says Boucheta. “The UK move not to implement the full CSDR rules will bring the attention from EU regulators, and it is a good thing to help us push our various points.”In addition, Broadridge’s Pandiri believes that regulators will eventually look to align their respective frameworks that can preserve the flow of securities processing and post-trade activities.“While it looks like regulatory fragmentation at present, I do see this as a ‘creation moment’ for things coming back together, as practical market innovation starts to produce more fungible solutions that actually make securities processing easier across markets,” Pandiri says.Going forward, the UK and EU will most likely stay in close contact when formulating and implementing financial services regulation. The UK has been a leading voice for many of the post-financial crisis regulations, and it is hoped their expertise will continue to be leveraged.“The UK played a very important role in Brussels, and though it is no longer directly involved, it should carry on discussions for securities services regulations to avoid unintended consequences,” Boucheta concludes.This article was featured in the Spring 2021 edition of The TRADE magazine.","['clearing', 'posttrade', 'uk', 'happens', 'regulation', 'securities', 'services', 'activity', 'regulators', 'implement', 'postbrexit', 'eu']",2021-05-08,,thetradenews.com,EUREX

The coal plants are expected to be built in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Madagascar, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea and Vietnam.“The tens of thousands of cases of death and disease that would result from HSBC-linked coal power plants underline the urgency of shifting investments to clean energy to protect public health and the global climate,” Myllyvirta said.HSBC bowed to investor pressure over its support for fossil fuels earlier this year by vowing to phase out its financing of coal-fired power and coal mining by 2030 in developed economies, and by 2040 elsewhere in the world.However, the pledge will not extend to HSBC’s $612bn asset management arm, which is expected to continue investing in companies with plans to build coal power plants in developing countries.An HSBC spokesperson said the asset management arm, which often invests based on index-linked funds that include fossil fuel companies, does not invest directly in coal-fired power plants or coal mining-related infrastructure.“In line with our commitment to the Paris agreement, HSBC Global Asset Management has a policy on responsible investment. We prioritise high carbon sectors for early engagement and action to improve governance, targets, and disclosure of climate risk,” the spokesperson added.The scale of HSBC’s ongoing investment in coal through its asset management division was first revealed by Market Forces in a report earlier this year. Adam McGibbon, a lead campaigner at Market Forces, said although HSBC’s plans to keep investing in companies were understood, the “devastating human cost of these plants” was revealed in Crea’s report.“Coal plants mean death and HSBC, as an investor in these companies, are complicit. HSBC’s investments in such a huge number of new coal plant-building companies makes a mockery of their claim to support the Paris agreement. Ahead of their AGM and Cop26, HSBC must announce plans to phase out their ownership stakes in coal companies,” he said.HSBC will propose a special resolution on climate change at its AGM later this month, which will set out the next phase of the bank’s strategy to support its customers on the transition to net zero carbon emissions, including its pledge to phase out coal financing.The bank set out plans in October to reduce emissions in its operations and supply chain to net zero by 2030, and to align the bank’s financed emissions at a portfolio level to net zero by 2050 or sooner.","['management', 'hsbc', '70', 'hsbcs', 'power', 'stakes', 'asset', 'support', 'phase', 'companies', 'plans', 'firms', 'plants', 'plan', 'coal']",2021-05-12,,theguardian.com,EUREX

This allows it to determine whether a caller is genuine. In order to use the service, customers need to register for it.According to HSBC, the voice biometrics system has identified over 43,000 fraudulent phone calls and protected £981 million worth of customers’ money.With the onset of the pandemic and increased uptake of digital services, additional customers have signed up for the bank’s caller ID scheme. Currently, it has around 2.8 million active users.HSBC UK Head of Contact Centre and Customer Service Kerri-Anne Mills said: “We’ve seen unprecedented challenges as the pandemic and lockdown restrictions transformed our lives significantly and, unsurprisingly, more people have turned to online and mobile banking to take control of their finances, utilising other channels for very particular interactions.“Voice ID has not only made telephone banking more convenient for customers accessing their accounts, but it has also been instrumental in stopping attempts at telephone banking fraud, protecting customers’ money.“Scammers are sophisticated and it’s a constant challenge to keep ahead of them but this is promising – we’ve seen a 50% drop in reported telephone banking fraud year-on-year. We are now enrolling around 14,000 customers in Voice ID each week and the technology continues to be instrumental in the fight against fraud, providing a library of fraudsters’ voice prints to cross check against new incoming calls.”RecommendedAs more people use online services to handle their finances, cybercrime becomes more lucrative. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new tricks and tactics to gain access to user data, and ultimately their money, whether through traditional schemes, accessing accounts or ransomware.As such, organisations need to develop new ways to protect customers data. New tools such as password managers, 2-factor authentication and systems like HSBC’s Voice ID are essential in staying one step ahead of the cybercriminals.However, cybercriminals have been leveraging the power of AI to put many of these new techniques at risk. One of the new methods available to hackers are vocal deepfakes. With a relatively small amount of information, an AI can be trained to generate a convincing imitation of a person’s voice.A well-trained and produced vocal deepfake could be used to trick a computer system. While many deepfakes are created using publicly available material, such as corporate videos to imitate a company’s CEO, a phone call from a scammer could gather information needed to create a deepfake.Like this: Like Loading...","['cuts', 'banking', 'vocal', 'id', 'half', 'hsbc', 'customers', 'fraud', 'weve', 'system', 'caller', 'voice', 'telephone']",2021-05-08,,digit.fyi,EUREX

(0:31)CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Rory McIlroy finally won when he least expected it, and it was as sweet as he could have imagined.Only after he hung on for a one-shot victory in the Wells Fargo Championship, his first title in 18 months, did he reveal his neck locked up during his final practice session, and if not for a late tee time on Thursday he would have had to withdraw.When he seized control Sunday afternoon with back-to-back birdies from the bunker down the stretch, he started to get ahead of himself thinking how cool it would be to see his wife and 8-month-old daughter waiting to celebrate with him on their first Mother's Day.The finishing stretch at Quail Hollow snapped him back to reality. He hit a 7-iron safely over the water on the 17th, and caddie Harry Diamond wisely talked him into taking a penalty drop from a dangerous lie in a hazard on the closing hole. He two-putted from 45 feet for bogey, a 3-under 68 and a one-shot victory.The moment with Erica and little Poppy was what he imagined. So was that trophy.""It's tough to get over the line, especially if you haven't done it in a while,'' McIlroy said, a winner at Quail Hollow for the third time. ""It's such a funny week, knowing my game was pretty good and then having my neck lock up on the range and sitting here Sunday night with the trophy.""Just glad I got through it.''Abraham Ancer finished runner-up for the fourth time in his career as he seeks his first title. Ancer wasn't part of the picture until he ran off three straight birdies late that briefly gave him a share of the lead, and he nearly closed with a fourth birdie when his 35-foot putt on No. 18 grazed the lip. He shot 66.But this was about McIlroy -- who until this week had not played on the weekend in two months -- and the second-longest winless drought of his career.It was like he never was gone. McIlroy was bogey-free until the final hole, and even when he brought more pressure on himself with a poor tee shot, he delivered an 8-iron from just inside 200 yards to the fat of the green for his two-putt bogey to finish on 10-under 274.His last victory was the HSBC Champions in Shanghai on Nov. 3, 2019. His next start is in two weeks at Kiawah Island for the PGA Championship, where he set the record in 2012 with an eight-shot victory.How's that for timing?""I'm excited going forward now,'' McIlroy said.His game is not perfect -- he hit only three of 14 fairways in the final round -- but he was quick to say a victory brought validation.Locked in a tight race among Keith Mitchell, Gary Woodland and then Ancer, McIlroy delivered the goods on the back nine. He holed a 10-foot par putt on the par-3 13th. He got up-and-down for birdie with splendid bunker shots on the reachable par-4 14th and the par-5 15th.Rory McIlroy was able to celebrate his first victory in 18 months with his wife, Erica, and their 8-month-old daughter, Poppy, on their first Mother's Day. Tannen Maury/EPAMcIlroy won for the 19th time on the PGA Tour and 27th time worldwide.""This is one of my favorite places in the world,"" said McIlroy, who picked up his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow in 2010. ""To break the drought and win here, it's awesome.''It was a tough finish for Mitchell, who started the final round with a two-shot lead and quickly stretched it to three shots with a 6-iron out of a fairway bunker into a stiffening breeze to 12 feet for birdie.But his short game let him down all day, leading to bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes that cost him the lead; and on the 14th hole and 15th holes, he had to settle for pars after being in position for birdies.Mitchell needed to finish alone in second to qualify for the PGA Championship through the money list. But he dropped a shot on the 17th and closed with a 72 to tie for third with Viktor Hovland, who had a 67.""Shows you how awesome he is as a player because he didn't have his best today and he still won, and that's why he's got majors and a bunch of wins,'' Mitchell said of McIlroy.Woodland had a share of the lead early on the back nine until he went through a bad patch of back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 12 and 13 and then settled for pars on the next two scoring holes. He shot 71 and finished fifth.McIlroy could have done without the drama on the 18th. With a two-shot lead, his drive went left of the winding stream into a deep hole of shaggy grass near the water. He started to try to gouge it out toward the fairway when Diamond stepped in to offer a few alternatives.They picked the right one: a penalty drop that limited any chaos, and McIlroy delivered a winner. His 2-foot par putt brought out one of the loudest cheers of a day filled with them. The Wells Fargo Championship had more energy than any tournament since golf returned from the pandemic.Just what McIlroy needed.He thought he would enjoy some quiet of no spectators. It didn't take long for him to realize he missed the energy.""To bring out the best in myself, I needed this,"" he said.And when it was over, McIlroy turned and heaved his golf ball toward the crowd. That felt good, too.","['won', 'wells', 'stroke', 'mcilroy', 'lead', 'shot', 'wins', 'months', 'pga', 'fargo', '18', 'championship', 'rory', 'victory', 'hole', 'final']",2021-05-09,,espn.com,EUREX

He is the author of The Art of Currency Trading (Wiley, 2019) and his latest book, Alpha Trader, hits the shelves in Q2 2021.You can contact Brent at [email protected] and on Twitter at donnelly_brent.As with all of our guest contributors, Brent’s post may not represent the views of Epsilon Theory or Second Foundation Partners, and should not be construed as advice to purchase or sell any security.With the intense sturm und drang around inflation right now, expect the next six months to yield intense hand-wringing and chin scratching over CPI, PCE and … hedonic quality adjustment. Quite often when people go to Twitter to rail about CPI, they say something like “Man, my cost of living doesn’t look like that! My tuition and health care costs are skyrocketing!” Savvy statisticians then respond with a flurry of charts that look like the one at right and say “the plural of anecdote is not data” or something similar. So all those rising prices are being offset by all those falling prices and people are just noticing the prices that go up, right? Nope. The source of the data on that chart is the BLS, the U.S. organization charged with preparing the CPI data. The data has been sliced and diced like crazy. The CPI index is not a cost of living measure! It is a hedonically-adjusted basket of assumptions that attempts to track some sort of cost vs. quality / total-utility metric over time. So what exactly is hedonic quality adjustment? Let’s ask the BLS:Hedonic quality adjustment is one of the techniques the CPI uses to account for changing product quality within some CPI item samples. Hedonic quality adjustment refers to a method of adjusting prices whenever the characteristics of the products included in the CPI change due to innovation or the introduction of completely new products. The use of the word “hedonic” to describe this technique stems from the word’s Greek origin meaning “of or related to pleasure.” Economists approximate pleasure to the idea of utility – a measure of relative satisfaction from consumption of goods. In price index methodology, hedonic quality adjustment has come to mean the practice of decomposing an item into its constituent characteristics, obtaining estimates of the value of the utility derived from each characteristic, and using those value estimates to adjust prices when the quality of a good changes. The CPI obtains the value estimates used to adjust prices through the statistical technique known as regression analysis. Hedonic regression models are estimated to determine the value of the utility derived from each of the characteristics that jointly constitute an item.There is a significant degree of modelling and massaging going on. The BLS dances around the CPI as cost of living measure question here (see question  9) and the media often inaccurately describe CPI data as changes in cost of living. This leads to a situation where people see prices ripping higher and CPI at 2.0% and it makes them want to yell at CPI.Since I always think of TVs and cars as goods that have seen flat or falling prices over the years, I decided to have a quick peek at the real life vs. BLS-imagined price movements in the world of new vehicles. I made the arbitrary and grossly simplifying decision to use the Honda Accord and the Ford Mustang as my cars because they have been popular for more than 30 years, there is plenty of historical pricing data, and their target demographics and brand image haven’t changed much over time.Here is the Honda Accord, then and now:The 1990 vs. 2020 versions are clearly not the same car, especially when you compare airbags (or lack thereof), ABS, computer-assist, and all that stuff. The tricky thing for non-time-traveling humans, though, is that roughly the same socioeconomic cohort that bought Ford Mustangs or Honda Accords in 1990 is in line to buy those same cars in 2021. If you hedonically-adjust away the improvements, you are not talking about cost of living anymore, you are talking about quality-adjusted or utility-adjusted cost of living. And the result is a super-squishy approach that requires a litany of assumptions and leads to model output that is more a vague approximation of some utility-adjusted price, not an index that reflects actual real life changes in price.The next chart is one I created that shows the evolution of the BLS new vehicle price data (red) along with the average price of a Honda Accord and a Ford Mustang each year. Funny enough, the price of a car and the average hourly wage move up at about the same speed (probably not a coincidence!). That’s how Honda Accords and Ford Mustangs remain workhorse middle class cars for over 30 years. If the price was truly remaining flat as the BLS series implies, we’d all be driving BMWs (and eventually McLarens) as wages go higher in a fairly straight line and car prices remain unch.Did the price of cars go up, or stay flat since 1990? It’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer!Nominal prices of cars went up about 150%. Hedonically-adjusted car prices barely moved[1]. Real car prices (adjusted for wage growth) were flat. My brain is becoming a pretzel.And for good order this analysis is not sensitive to what kind of car you pick. All the lines look about the same, the only difference is the upward gradient of the slope, never the direction.And when it comes to new vehicles, here are some quality changes that might trigger a hedonic adjustment:If you’re curious, here is the BLS explainer for hedonic adjustment, which includes this fun stuff:If the item being modeled is men’s shirts, the independent variables might be sleeve length and fiber composition; a simplified version of a hedonic model for men’s shirts might be:Here all shirts are either short sleeve or long sleeve and either cotton/poly or 100% cotton. After doing the statistical processing BLS might estimate that ß1 = 0.15 and ß2 = 0.25. This indicates that a long sleeve shirt is 15 percent more valuable than a short sleeve one and that a 100% cotton shirt is 25 percent more valuable than a cotton/poly blend shirt. If the BLS data collector is forced to replace a short-sleeve cotton/poly shirt in the CPI sample with a long sleeve 100% cotton shirt, the CPI would adjust the price of the old item by the features in the new item, leading to a price adjustment of about 49 percent (e0.15+0.25).If the price of the original shirt had been $20 and that of the replacement shirt $30, rather than using a $10 increase in price for that sample observation, the CPI would adjust the original shirt for sleeves and cotton content resulting in a price estimate of $29.84 (20*e0.15+0.25). This adjustment attributes most of the price difference between the shirts to the change in characteristics and an increase of only $0.16 is shown.With 46% of the products in CPI hedonically adjusted, it’s hard to know what CPI is actually telling us. Here is a good description of the problem from the Praxis Advisory blog.While theoretically attractive, hedonic adjustment misses a key point. In all likelihood the good purchased was for the same or slightly higher price, regardless of quality (have Lexus cars dropped in price over the last 5 years?) Consider the following example. Say the only product that Americans purchase are M&M candies—100 M&Ms in a bag that costs $1.00. Each person is limited to one bag. Through the miracle of productivity, a way is found to fill each bag with 110 M&Ms that is now priced at $1.10. Hedonic adjustment would say that the bag really only costs $1.00 and that the CPI has not increased, since each M&M still costs a penny each. But the cost of the bag of M&Ms has gone up. And since each person must buy a bag, instead of an individual M&M, their cost of living has gone up by 10%. They must fork over an extra dime even though they’re getting more for their money. We can’t buy individual parts of a new car; we have to buy the whole car, complete with quality improvements. And the whole package costs more, improved or not. While hedonic adjustment may accurately reflect productivity increases, they don’t accurately reflect America’s cost to live. These adjustments accrue to businesses (which in turn don’t provide adequate raises) and the federal government (which in turn under-compensates Social Security recipients).Which is all fine and good. But we’re still left with this:A Honda Accord cost $12,000 in 1990 and it costs $25,000 now.A Mustang was $9,000 and now it’s $27,000.The BLS has new car prices close to unchanged over the past 30 years.Here’s the best my pretzel-brain can do to reconcile this. Here are my takeaways:People think CPI is a cost of living index, but it’s not. Stop comparing CPI to how your cost of living has changed.That said, the BLS does not push back very hard on the idea of CPI as a cost of living index!Even though CPI is not a cost of living index, CPI is still used for cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security and other benefits. CPI is also used to price TIPS.There is a point of abstraction at which the original object is no longer recognizable. It is possible that CPI is such an abstraction and this explains why it does not compute with the everyperson’s day-to-day experience. We are all staring at Salvador Dalí’s “Persistence of Memory” screaming “that’s not a clock!” It IS a clock. But it’s also not a clock.Prices for an item can go up or down and that item’s contribution to CPI can be in the same direction, the opposite direction or zero.Interestingly, hedonic adjustments only act as deflators. Say the airline crams another seat in your row, eliminates carry-on bags and otherwise makes your flight less happy and hedonic. Does the hedonically-adjusted price of your airfare increase? Nope.CPI is a model output dependent on a huge string of assumptions, not necessarily a true reflection of price changes for goods and services purchased by individual consumers.Just because you hear 14 scary inflation anecdotes tomorrow, don’t assume all or any of those price movements will impact CPI in the way that you expect. They might! Or they might not.This has been my best attempt to better understand the inner workings of CPI and why it looks and smells so different from reality. There is no easy answer to this conundrum as evidenced by this long discussion on the topic on the Social Security dot gov website, but I think this article from Bloomberg on the history of CPI sums it up pretty well:The first architects of price indexes appreciated the degree to which these numbers are nothing more than vague approximations that, precisely because they rest on such shaky foundations, can be put toward political ends.Sounds about right. Have a plaid and/or ludicrous day.[1] I am fairly sure hedonic-adjustment of new vehicle prices started in 1998 / 1999 but I couldn’t find the precise answer.Brent Donnelly is a senior risk-taker and FX market maker at HSBC New York and has been trading foreign exchange since 1995.

That was the difference.“Shows you how awesome he is as a player,” Mitchell said, “because he didn't have his best today and he still won and that's why he's got majors and a bunch of wins. It's impressive watching that because he had to fight there today, too. The wind was gusting like crazy.”It marked McIlroy’s 19th PGA TOUR victory, and his third at the Wells Fargo (2010, ’15, ’21). This also marks the first time he’s won a tournament three times, which he called “pretty cool,” and yet that seemed relatively unimportant next to the fact that he was winning at all.It had been 553 days since McIlroy won the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions. He came into the Wells Fargo at 15th in the Official World Golf Ranking, the lowest he’s been since late 2009, and 51st in the FedExCup. Some of his problems, he admitted, were self-inflicted.He was rolling along nicely prior to the pandemic, but when the TOUR returned without fans on site last June, McIlroy had trouble summoning the requisite oomph for world-class golf. He and wife Erica had a daughter, Poppy, their first child, unquestionably the highlight of the year.His forgettable golf got worse this season after Bryson DeChambeau bashed his way to victory at the U.S. Open and McIlroy decided to try and increase his swing speed. In so doing he lost his swing. After a final-round 76 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard (T10, eight behind DeChambeau) in March, he said he was “dejected” and “maybe looking to go in a different direction.”Soon he was working with Pete Cowen, and it was the first time he’s listed someone other than Michael Bannon as his primary coach. He said it was for the long-term good of his career, and the swing changes might take, “a bit of time.” He missed cuts at THE PLAYERS Championship and the Masters, took a vacation to the Bahamas, came home, kept grinding.Quail Hollow, though, is McIlroy’s happy place. In 10 starts at the Wells Fargo he now has eight top-10 finishes, including three wins. He shot a course-record 62 to win going away in 2010 and broke his own record with a 61 in his 2015 victory. He seems to win here every five years whether he needs it or not. (There was no tournament in 2020 or he surely would have won it.)With the victory, he has now won on Father’s and Mother’s Day, and there, just off the 18th green and in a floppy sun hat, was wife Erica cradling Poppy. He bent down to give them a celebratory kiss, the scene further underlining that this was a changed McIlroy. This was his first win as a dad, and his first with new coach Cowen. He’s been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella for the last few months. And living through the pandemic has changed us all.","['won', 'wells', 'golf', 'swing', 'mcilroy', 'fargo', 'came', 'hangs', 'championship', 'rory', 'hes', 'victory', 'win']",2021-05-10,,pgatour.com,EUREX

HSBC,1,PyNews API,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-companies-breakingview-idUSKBN2CR1JH,Breakdown: Net zero goals demand zero tolerance - Reuters,"Oxford University researchers found only a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies by sales have a net zero target.Many heavy polluters like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) lack net zero targets and full disclosure of their emissions.Big banks that lend to carbon-intensive industries have been similarly slow to elaborate on net zero aspirations.Yet Oxford researchers reckon only a third of corporate net zero targets cover all three.- The new group – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – will bring existing net zero initiatives together under one umbrella to help ensure all sub-sector efforts are consistent and ambitious.","The Wahlenberg Glacier is seen in Oscar II land at Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway, August 5, 2019.What do Microsoft (MSFT.O), British Airways, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), and Glencore (GLEN.L) have in common? They all reckon their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will hit “net zero” by 2050. Though the targets sound the same, investors shouldn’t assume they are. Breakingviews offers a way to sort substance from hot air.WHAT EXACTLY IS NET ZERO?To limit the increase in the planet’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world needs to stop pumping new GHGs into the atmosphere by 2050 at the latest. That means eliminating 50 billion tonnes of annual emissions from the atmosphere. The “net” part of this target reflects its difficulty: many industries lack low-carbon alternatives. The Network for Greening the Financial System, a grouping of central banks, reckons heavy emitters could still produce 13 billion tonnes of GHGs annually by 2050. Cancelling these out means planting more trees to absorb the carbon dioxide or developing ways to remove gases from the air.HOW ALIGNED ARE COMPANIES WITH NET ZERO?Not very. Oxford University researchers found only a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies by sales have a net zero target. A separate report by the NewClimate Institute said that as of October 2020, companies with net zero objectives represented only 3.5 billion tonnes of GHGs a year. By comparison, a 2017 study by environmental charity CDP estimated the top 224 corporate emitters accounted for 30 billion tonnes annually.Many heavy polluters like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) lack net zero targets and full disclosure of their emissions. Big banks that lend to carbon-intensive industries have been similarly slow to elaborate on net zero aspirations.WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SET TARGETS?They’re a mixed bag. Microsoft wants to develop technology to remove not only its current GHG output but to erase all emissions since the $2 trillion software group was founded in 1975. That’s laudable, but even today its annual emissions are less than 20 million tonnes. British Airways parent International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) produces 40 million tonnes, miner Glencore 300 million tonnes, and Shell 600 million tonnes – more than the United Kingdom.Many net zero targets have three shortcomings: incomplete disclosure, confusing terminology, and problems with offsets.WHAT’S THE PROBLEM WITH DISCLOSURE?Companies serious about net zero targets should include not just so-called Scope 1 and 2 emissions, produced when they make their products, but also Scope 3, created when customers use those products. Think power stations burning Glencore’s coal, or cars fuelled by Shell’s petrol. Yet Oxford researchers reckon only a third of corporate net zero targets cover all three.Large oil companies, for whom Scope 3 often constitutes 90% of total emissions, have recently improved their disclosure. But it’s still frustratingly piecemeal. Shell’s net zero target covers all three scopes worldwide. BP’s (BP.L) is similar but leaves out its 20% stake in Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), which accounts for a third of the UK group’s oil production. Total’s (TOTF.PA) net zero target only includes European Scope 3 emissions.WHAT ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY?A company claiming to be “carbon neutral” might sound the same as net zero. In fact, carbon dioxide accounts for only 75% of overall GHGs. Oil giants can use this loophole to ignore worse pollutants like methane.Meanwhile companies that embrace “Paris-aligned” targets are craftily exploiting the fact that the 2015 accord signed in the French capital called for limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. That’s less demanding than the tougher limit of 1.5 degrees. JPMorgan (JPM.N) says it aligns the most polluting sectors it lends to with “the goals of Paris”, but the U.S. bank doesn’t have a company-level commitment to hit net zero by 2050.WHAT’S WRONG WITH OFFSETS?Many companies intend to hit their targets by offsetting emissions. This involves buying credits in carbon-cutting ventures elsewhere. Offsets are integral to Shell, Glencore and IAG’s plans. The hope is that sellers of such credits use the money to plant new forests or develop technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere.The danger is that companies just use flakier offsets to slow down actual reductions in emissions. Even leaving aside fraudulent ones, it’s hard to prove how much offset schemes reduce GHGs. They often base their emissions-cutting credentials on counterfactuals: preserving a forest that would otherwise be pulled down, for example.Besides, it’s hard to guarantee offsets will work on the scale required. Shell’s net zero assumptions imply planting new trees across an area the size of Brazil. Total calls its shipments of liquefied natural gas to China “carbon neutral” because the French group is providing financing for a Chinese wind power project and a Zimbabwean forest protection scheme.Only 33 of the 417 companies with net zero targets don’t plan to use offsets, Oxford researchers found. Just under two-thirds either gave no detail or said they would use them liberally.WOULD BANNING OFFSETS MAKE NET ZERO TARGETS MORE CREDIBLE?Yes. But unless governments want to pay for tree-planting and carbon removal technology, there’s a role for private finance. One option is voluntary carbon markets, where companies that reduce or eliminate GHGs sell credits. Ex-Bank of England Governor Mark Carney reckons credits worth 100 million tonnes a year currently could become 1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, with checks and balances to ensure their credibility.A more radical alternative would be to bin net zero goals altogether. Instead of stimulating dubious offsets to meet otherwise-unattainable targets, the World Wildlife Fund and Boston Consulting Group suggest companies disclose their emissions, estimate how much they can credibly reduce them, and pledge funding for research into permanent GHG removal.SO DO NET ZERO GOALS HAVE ANY VALUE?Despite the brickbats, they are useful for focusing minds. But they need a better-regulated offset market, full disclosure of emissions and consensus about what the goal means. In the continuing absence of all three, investors should treat each bold target with scepticism.Follow gfhay on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on April 21 announced a new plan to boost efforts by the financial system to help move the global economy to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.- The new group – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – will bring existing net zero initiatives together under one umbrella to help ensure all sub-sector efforts are consistent and ambitious. So far, more than 160 firms with assets of at least $70 trillion have signed up, of which 43 are banks. Members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance include Barclays, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Bank of America and Citi.- All members will need to set climate plans in line with the U.N.’s Race to Zero campaign, which ensures they are science-based, cover all types of emissions, have 2030 interim targets and commit to transparent reporting and accounting.- The banks joining GFANZ will need to set an interim target of 2030 or sooner within 18 months that focuses on those parts of their financing business responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions.","['offsets', 'carbon', 'breakdown', 'demand', 'net', 'ghgs', 'goals', 'tonnes', 'emissions', 'companies', 'targets', 'target', 'zero', 'tolerance']",2021-05-10,,reuters.com,EUREX

Morgan Private Bank(Left to right, top to bottom:) Brian Swenson, Eric Smith, Jesse Bohannon, Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter moved to Morgan Stanley from J.P. Morgan Private Bank.The group is led by advisors Brian R. Swenson, Eric T. Smith, and Jesse F. Bohannon and also includes support staff Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter. They had overseen $2.8 billion in customer assets, and have joined Morgan Stanley’s private wealth management business after a 90-day garden leave, the source confirmed.Swenson, who spent his career at J.P. Morgan since he first registered there in 2006, according to BrokerCheck, did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. He officially joined Morgan Stanley on May 3, according to the database, although Smith and Bohannon registered with the wirehouse in March and January, respectively.Swenson had been a managing director at J.P. Morgan, a corporate title that a source at the firm said previously carries a 90-day garden leave, while others moving with him were likely obligated to wait only 60 days or fewer before joining their new firm.Swenson had also been head of the private banking business in Utah and Idaho, according to LinkedIn, which shows he started as an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Denver after graduating in 2003 from Brigham Young University.Smith, who was an executive director, started his career at J.P. Morgan in 2011. Bohannon spent a rookie year at Jefferies in 2015 and worked at Morgan Stanley between 2016 and 2018 before joining J.P. Morgan, according to BrokerCheck.A J.P. Morgan spokesperson confirmed the departure but declined to comment on client assets or production figures.J.P. Morgan in March tapped private banker Kristin Schaefer to replace Swenson as market lead in the two states, according to an internal memo sent March 9. Schaefer had been with J.P. Morgan since 2020, when she left Wells Fargo & Co.’s Private Bank.She had also worked as a global banking consultant at Wells Fargo in Palo Alto, California, before moving to Utah in 2016, according to the memo, and reports to Geoff Barker, J.P. Morgan Private Bank Market Manager for the Rockies Region.“Her depth of experience, the global power of J.P. Morgan and local expertise of the Private Bank team will deepen our commitment to the region and offer a wealth management platform not seen before in this market,” Barker said in the memo.Swenson’s team follows a path of large salaried banking teams who have been joining traditional brokerage firms with increasing frequency over the past year. Recruiters have said wirehouses have turned a fresh eye to those teams, which they had historically not targeted given the garden-leave policies and customer bank ties that can make transferring assets difficult.UBS Wealth Management USA last week recruited what several sources said was one of the largest teams at J.P. Morgan, a Dallas group led by Cindy Brown who generated $75 million in revenue from $25 billion in assets. It also hired a $2 billion-AUM team from Bank of America’s private bank in California.Merrill Lynch last month recruited a Citibank private banker in San Francisco who reportedly oversaw $17 billion in client assets.Morgan Stanley has been aggressively recruiting large broker teams across the industry since it restarted its recruiting engine last year after pulling out in 2017 of the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, the industry recruiting and client solicitation pact. Morgan Stanley no longer breaks out specific headcount, which a spokesperson said last month is around 16,000, including several hundred call-center based brokers.J.P.

Investors looked to leverage as much of that momentum as they could by moving away from pricey so-called growth stocks, such as big technology companies, toward what are known as value stocks, which are more closely linked to the underlying economy, such as the infrastructure and banking sectors.The European region is more heavily exposed to those sectors that benefit from economic recovery, such as industrials, retail, and transport, while the US market has more exposure to tech stocks, many of which were considered COVID-19 stay-at-home winners.Yet even with the recovery fully gaining traction in developed markets, Europe's relative flows remain at the low end of historical ranges compared with the record inflows that global equities have seen in the past three months, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.In a report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analysts said global investors should consider the European region.The Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Garman said Europe had outperformed MSCI's All Country World Index since February ""yet there is little evidence of love for the region in a global context.""Relative valuations are close to 10-year lows, and even when adjusted by sector Europe still looks cheap relative to MSCI's All Country World Index, a leading global index, Garman said.European equities have matched the performance of US blue-chip stocks so far this year. The STOXX 600 — an index of major European shares — is up about 11% in 2021, the same as the S&P 500.Morgan Stanley said rising government-bond yields were driving a better period for European equities. Over the past 12 months, however, European shares have lagged their US peers. The STOXX 600 has gained about 30%, while the S&P 500 has risen by over 40% to record highs this month.This could soon come to a halt, however.Morgan Stanley's US economists are predicting the Federal Reserve might start discussing slowing the pace of its asset purchases, or quantitative easing, when it meets in June, a tool it used to support the economy.Many analysts believe quantitative easing has inflated asset prices and that tapering, in turn, could create a slowdown in the stock market.""Assuming longer-term growth outlook remains favorable, such a period should represent a temporary pause/reset in a bull market rather than anything more extreme — over the long run, equity markets generally track underlying EPS trends,"" Garman said.Despite the potential pause to the bull-market rally in the US, the analysts expect Europe's economic momentum to further boost European equity performance over the summer.The analysts also emphasize that investors should worry less about the region's sectoral mix compared with previous years.""In each of the last 10 years, Europe's sector composition has acted as a drag, with the lack of tech the biggest contributor to this,"" Garman said.The mix is now changing. Technology is now the biggest sector within the STOXX 50, an index of the 50 largest eurozone stocks.""This ongoing change implies higher and less volatile trend EPS growth going forward, and should also make it easier for global investors looking for exposure to structural growth to engage with European equities,"" Garman said.A graph of technology's share of European initial public offerings from Morgan Stanley's Wednesday research note.

The British company, the world's biggest caterer, is seeing improving demand in the United States, its largest market, analysts said, after a tepid fiscal first half ended March. Global companies in the past two weeks, including Exxon and Under Armour have reported improvements in their businesses, and a measure of U.S. services industry activity has surged recently, indicating improving demand from U.S. customers. Compass, which serves staff at firms including Microsoft Corp and Chevron Corp, as well as school kids and healthcare workers, will publish on Wednesday results for its fiscal first half. Investors will watch for commentary on the second half, looking for signs that efforts to cut costs and renegotiate contracts are bearing fruit.

Compass gained market share in the United States last year, cornering about 22% of the total contract catering market, Morgan Stanley analyst Jamie Rollo said. It outperformed rivals Sodexo and Aramark in the healthcare space, thanks to new business wins, he added.

Any views expressed here are his own)LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Global investors have flipped from ‘buy everything’ to ‘peak everything’ in a matter of weeks - but these manic mood swings may even out soon.Stock markets appear to have run into the sand after several weeks of torrential inflows. By Bank of America’s reckoning the influx into world equity funds over the past five months exceeded that of the past 12 years combined.Fears of ‘too much, too soon’ prompted many investment firms - including Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan - to warn in recent weeks of a possible 5-10% correction ahead.This week’s tech-led shakeout - the second such wobble in less than 3 months - reinforced a whole host of those anxieties - everything from ‘peak’ business sentiment, earnings and output growth to ‘peak’ central bank largesse, excess liquidity and investment flows.The unfolding surge in economic activity as economies reopen may endure for another year or more. But annual or annualised rates of change may be cresting while related commodity price rebounds, supply bottlenecks and annual base effects keep hands wringing that ‘peak’ inflation is yet to come - whether tolerated by central banks or not.Unlike February’s sharp intake of breath, this week’s equity market gasp had little to do with rising interest rates or long-term borrowing costs per se. Implied yields on one of the widest measures of public and private sector bonds worldwide - the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse - has barely budged for 2 months.And yet Morgan Stanley - a long-standing and accurate predictor a V-shaped equity market bounce since the pandemic shock last March - now posits that we’re already in a ‘mid-cycle transition’ where ‘flattish’ returns for 2021 as a whole are to be expected, with a 10-20% correction along the way.Citing corporate margin pressures from the sort of commodity and wage input price pressures nagging stock traders all month, it reckons now’s the time to get more defensive. “It’s often better to travel than arrive from an investment perspective.”History supports that. Deutsche last month flagged that Wall Street’s S&P500 benchmark has dropped by a median 8.3% following 37 peaks in the U.S. Institute of Supply Management’s (ISM) business sentiment index since World War Two.The retreat in ISM manufacturing and service sector indices for April - from 37-year and record highs respectively in March - most likely unnerved investors that the top of that cycle may now be in.And perhaps unsurprisingly, hedge funds - according to Bank of America - leaned heavily into the most recent record highs with registered net sales at a record over a 12-year dataset.Beyond the States, JPMorgan’s April global business survey indices hit a 14-year high. It said that was consistent with ‘boomy’ 4% annualised world output growth - an expansion that it still forecasts will hit 6% for the second quarter as a whole, with input and output prices growth at its fastest in 12 years.CHEAPENINGSo, is that it? Has the great stock market ‘discounting mechanism’ - as Morgan Stanley describes it - already discounted the entire post-pandemic recovery?Prior to this week MSCI’s all-country stock index had risen almost 90% from the March nadir last year - some 22% above pre-pandemic highs.But not everyone’s convinced of peak markets just yet.David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management points out that angst about historically expensive stock valuations may be overstated as earnings forecasts have clearly been underclubbed and even UBS’ own call of 31% profit growth for S&P500 firms for 2021 may now be ‘too conservative’.Lefkowitz, UBS equities chief for the Americas, said first quarter profit growth is running about 24% ahead of consensus forecasts and estimates for the next 12 months have been revised up by 16% since the start of the year - more than the 13% rise in stock prices to new records last week.Remarkably, that means 12-month forward Price/Earnings ratios have fallen this year both for the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq - and indeed for European benchmarks - despite the appearance of runaway markets and an investor scramble.“Strong revenue growth is overwhelming the cost trends,” Lefkowitz said in a blog, adding he retained a year-end 4,400 forecast for the S&P500 - now 7% higher than current levels.And then there’s the return of stock buybacks. Precautionary cash held by many firms during the pandemic is being freed up again, with buybacks tending to come in advance of a rebound in dividend payouts and year-to-date U.S. buybacks of some $300 billion already more than twice a year ago.Neuberger Berman’s multi-asset chief investment officer Erik Knutzen feels the pause will be temporary. “There will be higher market peaks to climb.”","['columnpeaky', 'sp500', 'look', 'investment', 'bank', 'peak', 'weeks', 'growth', 'market', 'dolan', 'mike', 'durable', 'markets', '12', 'stock']",2021-05-12,,reuters.com,EUREX

said, “Many businesses now recognise the importance of sustainable practices to their future business strategy.“We’ve co-developed this innovative new pilot programme in partnership with Business in the Community to help our customers take meaningful steps towards creating their own climate change mitigation plans.“It’s a positive sign of intent from this group of customers that they have committed the time required to take part, and we hope to see them sign the Climate Action Pledge at the end of the process.”Keelin McCone, Programme Manager from Business in the Community added, “Addressing climate breakdown is necessary to ensure a liveable future and businesses have a key role to play in this by implementing measures to reduce their GHG emissions.“Business in the Community

At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

The Bank of Canada's C$1 billion ($806 million) cut to its weekly bond-buying programme last month highlights the next phase is about slowing hefty asset purchases.Bank of America estimates central bank asset purchases in the United States, Japan, the euro zone and Britain will slide to about $3.4 trillion this year from almost $9 trillion in 2020. For 2022, it predicts purchases of just $400 billion.Here's a look at who is tapering, who may raise interest rates and who might be the last to call time on pandemic-era monetary stimulus.1/ NORWAYNorges Bank is at the vanguard in terms of signalling a retreat, and said on Thursday it is on track to hike interest rates in the second half of 2021.That has made the crown this year's best performing G10 currency. The central bank doesn't intervene in bond markets, so the taper debate is not applicable.2/ CANADAHaving announced tapering, Canada has signalled that its key interest rate could rise from 0.25% late in 2022.3/ BRITAINFlagging a stronger economic rebound, the BoE will slow bond-buying to 3.4 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) a week, from the 4.4 billion-pound current weekly pace.However, it kept the total size of the bond-buying programme unchanged at 895 billion pounds and Governor Andrew Bailey said the move did not amount to tapering.""Since the Bank has already purchased 70 billion pounds out of the 150 billion pounds in gilts to be purchased by the end of 2021, purchases were already set to naturally slow,"" Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said.Story continuesFor a graphic on British bond markets stable as BoE slows weekly bond buys: UNITED STATESThe Fed plans to keep borrowing costs near 0% and maintain monthly asset purchases worth $120 billion until it sees ""substantial further progress"" towards full employment and its 2% flexible inflation target.But with the economy expected to grow by more than 6% this year and inflation to be a ""little higher"" - according to Fed boss Jerome Powell - markets are pricing in a rate rise in 2023. Many analysts expect tapering to start this year.The Fed faces a delicate balancing act, ensuring that tapering at a time of massive U.S. government borrowing does not boost Treasury yields too much.Pictet Wealth senior economist Thomas Costerg expects tapering to start by early 2022 and proceed at a monthly pace of $10 billion. That process would last about a year - ""enough to keep expectations for the first rate hike well in the distance"", he added.For a graphic on Central bank holdings of government bonds: SWEDENSwedish inflation is approaching the Riksbank's 2% target but it has said interest rates would stay at 0% for years. However, its 700 billion crowns ($84 billion) asset purchase programme will wind down this year as planned.6/ EURO ZONEAnaemic long-term inflationary pressures mean euro area rates are unlikely to rise for years. But tapering may come sooner, especially within the European Central Bank's 1.85 trillion euro ($2.2 trillion) pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).Technically, this runs until March 2022 but some officials are already advocating reducing bond purchases as growth rebounds.Danske Bank analysts reckon the ECB will end up using only 1.65 trillion euros of the total PEPP stimulus package.For a graphic on ECB weekly PEPP purchases: AUSTRALIAAustralia's economic rebound has surpassed expectations but the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has underscored its dovish credentials by adopting yield curve control, could be among the last to tighten policy.It wants unemployment slashed and inflation within its 2% to 3% target before shifting tack, and doesn't see either happening until 2024. Economists expect rates to stay on hold until then.The RBA's A$100 billion ($77.45 billion) QE programme ends in September and it will consider in July whether to extend it.8/ NEW ZEALANDNew Zealand's strong recovery and red-hot property markets have raised speculation a rate rise may come sooner than expected.While its key interest rate is expected to stay at 0.25% this year, some analysts predict a rise in the second half of 2022. The central bank meanwhile appears to be in no hurry to taper its NZ$100 billion ($72 billion) QE programme.9/ JAPANThe BOJ pledged last week to maintain stimulus using yield target control and via bonds and equity purchases.It has been accused of ""stealth tapering"" because its bond-buying has slowed since yield curve control (YCC) was adopted in 2016, though purchases have picked up slightly in the past year.In March, they were about 22.2 trillion yen ($204 billion)above levels a year ago. But that's still a quarter of the 81.96 trillion yen year-on-year increase in August 2016, just before YCC came in.For a graphic on BOJ steadily ‘stealth’ tapering its JGB buying:-CENTRALBANKS/TAPER/bdwpkbmllvm/chart.png10/ SWITZERLANDThe Swiss National Bank does not intervene in domestic bond markets, instead capping the Swiss franc through interventions which came to nearly 110 billion francs ($120 billion) in 2020.

Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully.

I am a mom. I am a cis gender Millennial who’s been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. . . I am intersectional. But my existence is not a box checking exercise.”Wait, what? If your existence isn’t about box checking, why did you literally just check off all the boxes in which you identify? Racial identity: check. Gender identity: check. Disability: check.The video goes on to showcase all the diversity and inclusion awards that the officer won during her time at the CIA. And she continues:“At 36, I refuse to internalize misguided patriarchal ideas of what a woman can or should be.”There you have it— the CIA’s new mission is not gathering and analyzing intelligence to defend the nation. It’s fighting back against the patriarchy.America’s enemies are shaking in their boots.Click here to watch the video.DC mayor bans dancing at weddingsThe Mayor of Washington DC has issued a health order which demands wedding guests stay seated at wedding receptions.The order specifically notes that at weddings, “Attendees and guests must remain seated and socially distanced from each other and other household groups… Standing and dancing receptions are not allowed.”Standing… is now illegal.The real irony here is that Washington DC is one of the MOST VACCINATED cities in the US, with 631,000 vaccine doses administered out of an adult population (according to census data) of 577,000.Click here to read the full order.Five years in prison for returning to Australia from IndiaThe Australian health department has banned travelers from entering Australia within 14 days of having been in India.The government says this order falls under the authority of the Biosecurity Act.This applies to Australian citizens as well, who could incur a fine of up to $66,600 and 5 years in prison for boarding a flight home.When asked about this insanity, the Prime Minister said, “I think the likelihood of any of that occurring is pretty much zero.”I guess that makes it OK. Of course, the likelihood would be exactly zero if his government hadn’t issued the ridiculous order to begin with.Click here to read the order .American Families Plan will allow IRS to monitor your bank accountA US Treasury Department fact sheet called Investing in the IRS and Improving Tax Compliance, explains the new powers the IRS would have under Biden’s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan:“This reform aims to provide the IRS information on account flows so that it has a lens into investment and business activity… it leverages the information that financial institutions already know about account holders, simply requiring that they add to their regular, annual reports information about aggregate account outflows and inflows.”In other words, the government already requires that banks spy on their customers, and report to the IRS.But now the banks would be forced to tell the IRS how much money came into each account, and how much left.They say this will help the IRS choose who to audit, since they will know if the money in their bank accounts matches what they disclosed on their tax filings.The government will assume you are a tax evader until you prove your innocence.Click here to read the Treasury fact sheet.Caitlyn Jenner opposes transgender athletes in women’s sportsThe most famous transgender person alive is against allowing transgender people to compete in women’s sports.When asked about the issue, Caitlyn Jenner said, “This is a question of fairness. That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair. And we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools.”This is even more interesting given that Jenner won a gold medal in the Olympic decathlon— as a biological male competing in male sports.So is Caitlyn Jenner transphobic for acknowledging biological facts?Click here to read the full story.Danish bank lowers threshold for charging negative interestThe central bank of Denmark charges Danish banks negative interest rates on their deposits.That means instead of earning interest for keeping money with the central bank, they have to pay to deposit money.Until recently, most banks absorbed the cost of this negative interest rather than passing it along to customers with small deposits.Now Danske Bank has announced it is lowering the threshold at which it will begin charging customers negative interest on their deposit accounts.Danske Bank has cut the threshold from 250,000 to 100,000 krone— from about $40,000 USD to $16,000 USD.Customers with more than $16,000 in combined deposits across all bank accounts will now be charged negative .6%— which would be $120 per year on a $20,000 balance.For customers with certain types of accounts, the threshold has been lowered to 0 krone. They will be charged no matter how little money they keep in the bank.Click here to read the statement.Court says $30,000 fines for tall grass are not excessiveA Florida town fined a man $500 per day for having tall grass in his yard.At the time, he was away tending to his recently deceased mother’s estate. By the time he came back to town, the fines had accrued to $30,000.And instead of negotiate with the man, the city opted to foreclose on his home to collect the fines.Obviously the man sued, in what should have been a clear case of excessive fines.But last week, a federal judge decided that $30,000 fines for tall grass do not violate the Constitution’s protection against excessive punishment .The fact that the city failed to notify the man until after the fines accrued, and then foreclosed on his home to collect, was also not excessive.Click here to read the full story.* * *On another note… We think gold could DOUBLE and silver could increase by up to 5 TIMES in the next few years.

But O’Sullivan’s timing was more pragmatic.“I was still teaching then and I’d finish school in Limerick at 12 o’clock on a Friday and bang up the road to Mayo, which was almost a three-hour drive back then,” says O’Sullivan, the founder and owner of Zeus Packaging. “Friday afternoon was the only time I could meet the procurement manager.“When I got Baxter Healthcare in year one of the business, it was a massive win for me. We still supply Baxter Healthcare in Mayo today with stretch film for all their business out of Irish plants.”Since starting Zeus out of his car as a reluctant teacher, the 51-year-old has transformed it into one of Europe’s largest privately-owned packaging companies. Zeus — a name inspired by a fellow passenger on a business trip rather than the Greek god —now employs 600 people in 26 countries, with operations in the UK, China, Spain, Germany, Poland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The company makes and supplies 9,000 different stock items to industries ranging from grocery and hospitality to food processing, pharma and agriculture. Zeus’s industrial division sells pallet wrapping and cardboard boxes, while its hygiene business sells cleaning supplies to factories, offices, supermarkets, manufacturers, restaurants and hotels.It also supplies packaging for takeaway meals and items such as coffee cups, stirrers, lids and bags to supermarkets such as Dunnes Stores and is the world’s No. 1 producer of twine and bale net.The company turned over €210m in 2020, thanks to organic growth and a string of acquisitions. Last Monday, Zeus completed its acquisition of Petruzalek, an Austrian-based food packaging business. The €20m-purchase, which was announced in February, strengthens the Dublin-based company’s geographic reach in 12 European countries. In 2020, Petruzalek generated revenue of about €58m.The deal was the last and largest purchase in Zeus’s three-year €40m acquisition strategy and was the seventh business to be embedded in the group in the past two years.It puts Zeus on track to become the largest independent packaging distribution business in Europe.O’Sullivan says: “Our five-year plan is to take the business to half a billion euro and that, by any stretch of the imagination, is significant for an Irish company.”Growing up in Britway, a farming community about 14km from the east Cork town of Fermoy, O’Sullivan always wanted to make money and “not be poor”. The O’Sullivans were non-farmers living in an agricultural heartland; his father drove a forklift for the Dairygold co-op and his mother looked after the family’s three children. The entrepreneur worked the entire way through his education, from primary school right through to his eventual master’s degree.He milked cows and rode out horses for local farmers, picked stones from fields for a pound a day, emulated his father by driving a forklift at Dairygold, and drew silage for an agricultural contractor.“I would see the farmers’ sons who had no interest in having a farm and I would have given anything to be them because I loved it so much,” O’Sullivan says. “I have plenty of chips on my shoulders and I fully believe I am where I am now because of my drive.”He attended the local Tech in Fermoy, but the vocational school didn’t offer any honours’ subjects. A teacher encouraged O’Sullivan to pursue four honours’ subjects on his own and even filled out the CAO form for him.“He said to me, ‘I know you have a chance of getting out and not hanging around town. You’re good at this stuff and you can do it’,” O’Sullivan says. “I got a course at Thomond College (now part of UL) to become a metalwork and engineering teacher, even though I had no interest it. I just wanted to work and to better myself.”After finishing the Leaving Cert at the age of 16, O’Sullivan had two options: accept his mother’s advice to work full-time as a farming contractor for 140 punts (€178) a week — “huge money at the time” — or become the first in his small Leaving Cert year to go to college.“Zero disrespect to my mom but I went to Limerick. It was supposed to be a stepping stone; I didn’t want to be a metalwork teacher.”While doing a master’s degree in engineering technology, O’Sullivan was working three other jobs, selling mobile phones, lecturing at Thomond College and even had a nixer as an electrician. He entered the packaging industry while he was teaching by working with a man who sold agricultural crop packaging. This eventually led to O’Sullivan giving up his teaching career to start his own business selling pallet wrapping in 1998.In 2002, when Zeus was generating annual revenues of €4m, mostly from transit packaging and industrial packaging for the likes of Dell, the introduction of a tax on plastic carrier bags spelled trouble for companies that over-relied on supplying them. O’Sullivan’s first-ever acquisition was a Dublin-based supplier of carrier bags to Spar and BWG in the capital.With a new-found taste for acquisitions, O’Sullivan went on to make four more. He borrowed extensively to build up the business this way until Zeus had achieved a turnover of €80m. Then the recession hit.“We were swimming out of our depth — big-time,” he says.“I had bought my last company in early 2008.“Nowadays, when we’re buying a business, we use all these parameters such as Ebitda and multiples. But I didn’t know what that meant back then — I had never had a business lecture in my life because I had learned everything on the hoof. Danske Bank sent over a guy from Copenhagen to me who said ‘your Ebitda is this and your gearing is minus this’.""I turned to him and said, ‘what is Ebitda?’ He said, ‘you owe us €50m and you don’t know what Ebitda is?’“The bank could have taken the business from me if they felt there was something they could do with it. But we were in such a bad position there was nothing they could do with it,” O’Sullivan says.Once business was back on track, he returned his attention to expansion. In 2019, Zeus embarked on a €40m-investment programme, buying an Irish hygiene supplies company called Essential Supplies, followed by manufacturer Aldar Tissues.UK Investments included Liverpool-based distribution business Smith Bateson, Lincolnshire-based food packaging business Van der Windt, and Saffron Waldon-based VaioPak.But by early 2020, Zeus was facing its second existential threat in a decade, as Covid-19 spread from China to Europe.“I probably had a fair bit of insight into how bad this was going to be because I was speaking to China every morning,” O’Sullivan says.When Ireland imposed a lockdown in March 2020, “I spent three weeks at our Rathcoole office without going home to make some very tough decisions very quickly.“Fantastic customers of mine were closed. My supply was coming in from Asia and I had it all paid for. We have 2.5m sq ft of warehouse space so imagine that getting overfull and customers saying ‘we don’t need it — we’re closed’.“At the moment, the whole supply chain is an absolute mess. In an ironic way, the Suez Canal (closure) was the best thing that happened to us because people saw this for real on RTÉ news. The price of container shipping has quadrupled in 12 months and everything is out of kilter. It’s going to take six to 12 months for the supply chain to sort itself out.”It was bedding down acquisitions, coupled with winning new contracts, that helped Zeus shore up revenue last year, when turnover increased 13.5pc to €210m, albeit lower than the original target of €230m.O’Sullivan expects Zeus to post revenue of €275m in 2021.While home deliveries and the food takeaway sector boosted demand for packaging, they couldn’t compensate for the closure of offices right across Zeus’s markets.“If you look at all the offices in Dublin, for instance, all those people who went in there every day before Covid spent money on food and the facility management companies we supply bought cleaning products and toilet paper,” he says. “You are never going to make up for the movement of people; in my business, people moving and going places equates to revenue.”O’Sullivan is also making moves of his own: over the last 18 months, he’s been stepping back from the day-to-day operations of Zeus. He has created a board structure, with Keith Ockenden at the helm as CEO. O’Sullivan now focuses on strategy, investment and innovation.He is especially keen to expand Zeus’s sustainability offering — the company has been selling fully compostable cups for 15 years and is about to launch a sustainable fibre lid to McDonald’s outlets.“While I completely intend to be around and be in my business, it would be desperately remiss of me if I didn’t put in the structures so that the business can survive if I wasn’t around tomorrow,” he says.Reflecting on the hard graft he put in since childhood to achieve his goals, the Corkman wonders whether future generations of entrepreneurs will have the same drive as him.“Kids nowadays — my kids included — have it so easy and I don’t know how that drive will be in them, even though I will do my level best to try and keep them grounded. When you already have all the stuff you want, how can you drive on for more stuff?”Expand Close CEO and owner of Zeus, Brian O’Sullivan.

While the budget deficit in the 12 months through June 2022 is wider than expected at 5% of GDP, it leaves the opposition Labor party struggling for a narrative when the conservative incumbent is spending so freely.“The budget continues the transition from crisis support to growth recovery,” said Chris Nicol, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in Melbourne. The program has “kept policy leadership in the fiscal court whilst signaling from the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to be one of patience -- both aiming for a ‘hot’ economy with stronger jobs, wages and inflation.”Frydenberg is joining international peers such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in ramping up spending to push the economy toward maximum employment. His program is being buttressed by the RBA’s record-low interest rates, yield target and bond-buying program that aim to break a prolonged run of weak inflation.The government is spending big on infrastructure, aged care and tax breaks for households and businesses. But it has given itself some wriggle room for later upgrades to the budget position by taking very conservative iron ore and jobless rate forecasts.Iron Ore, JobsTreasury estimates iron ore will fall back to $55 a ton by the end of March 2022, from more than $200 a ton at present. It also sees 4.75% unemployment in June 2023, a quarter percentage point higher than the RBA’s latest estimate.Finance Minister Simon Birmingham defended the forecasts in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.“People would accuse us of cooking the books if we were to make more ambitious assumptions,” he said. “We’ve maintained the conservative posture that is important to making sure that we actually have a budget that people can have faith in.”The budget acknowledged “upside risks” for commodities as industry liaison suggests iron ore could remain elevated for an extended period. “Meanwhile, a stronger recovery in steel production outside of China could also provide further support for iron ore and metallurgical coal prices,” it said.What Bloomberg Economics says...“The government has proposed recycling the windfall back into the economy through higher spending and tax cuts. The slower pace of fiscal consolidation provides additional support to monetary policy, but not enough to hasten the withdrawal of the central bank’s stimulus.”-- James McIntyre, economistFor the full note, click hereThe conservative government’s reorientation to big spender is a dramatic turnaround from just 18 months ago when it was driving toward the first budget surplus in a decade. At the time, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was dismissing calls for additional fiscal measures to support a relatively weak economy.In that spirit, the government has set aside concern about debt for now, reflecting low borrowing costs and a better starting position than global peers.Net debt is expected to be at 34.2% of GDP in June next year and peak just shy of A$1 trillion in June 2025, or 40.9% of GDP. That’s about half the U.S. and U.K. levels and about one-third of Japan’s, according to the budget papers.Yet the road to an election by next May is clouded by a sluggish vaccination rollout. The budget assumes overseas borders will remain closed until the middle of next year, suggesting Morrison will be campaigning for another term while the rollout is still unfolding.Another year of hardship for tourism and education is reflected in the budget allocating A$2.1 billion in support for aviation, tourism, the arts and international education providers.Among other key spending items in Frydenberg’s fiscal blueprint are:A$7.8 billion to extend tax relief to low- and middle-income earning AustraliansA$20.7 billion for the extension of a temporary program for expensing and loss carry-back for assets bought by firms that has already supported a rebound of machinery and equipment investmentA$15.2 billion in new commitments for road and railway projects across Australia$17.7 billion for the employment-intensive aged care sector; andA$1.9 billion for the Covid-19 vaccination strategyAndrew Boak, chief economist for Australia at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., argues the government should be trying to drive down unemployment even faster. He contrasts this with the U.S., which expects to achieve full employment by the end of this year.“The question is whether the budget is really ambitious enough,” he said. “On Treasury’s own forecasts they don’t get to full employment for more than two years from now against the backdrop of an inflation undershoot and super-low wages growth for over half a decade.”Still, the budget was well received by the three major credit ratings agencies that reaffirmed Australia’s AAA rating.Clouded OutlookAustralia’s success in navigating the economy through the pandemic is clouded by a downward spiral in ties with its largest trading partner, China. Last week China announced it was suspending a ministerial economic dialog, while Australia is reviewing whether to force a Chinese company to sell a lease to a strategically significant port used by the Australian and U.S. militaries.The budget papers acknowledged the threat in a thinly-veiled reference. “Ongoing global trade tensions and the potential for further trade actions continue to pose risks to the outlook for Australian exports,” they said.The government also faces increased pressure to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions as a consensus emerges among developed nations led by President Joe Biden.The budget response is limited. It sets out A$1.6 billion for priority clean energy technologies.“It was a missed opportunity to do things regarding cleaner and cheaper energy and in terms of diversifying our economy,” Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. The recovery “is hostage to a lot of uncertainty -- the China relationship is one of them, but in the nearer term the vaccine rollout is slower than in” comparable countries.Despite the challenges, the domestic economy looks set to roar, with Treasury forecasting GDP will rise 5.25% this calendar year, before cooling to 2.75% in 2022. The Australian electorate historically reward governments that demonstrate strong economic management.Jill Sheppard, a political analyst at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the budget was politically expedient and a lot would have to go wrong in the next year for Morrison’s government to lose the next election.The budget has “left the Labor opposition with very little to attack the government on,” she said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “Debt and deficit isn’t the order of the day any more -- we see voters not so worried about that as they used to be.”(Updates with finance minister in seventh paragraph, Goldman Sachs in 17th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['archegos', 'betting', 'ore', 'fiscal', 'lift', 'spending', 'economy', 'profit', 'update', 'support', 'global', 'iron', 'bloomberg', 'program', 'budget', 'billion', 'hit', 'despite', 'nomura', 'expansion']",2021-05-12,,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

Nomura,4,Google API,https://www.ijf.org/news/show/nomura-i-want-to-learn-more,Nomura: I Want to Learn More,"Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world.Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura.Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion.So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’.When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension.","Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world. The reason is simple: he is the only judoka to have won three Olympic gold medals (Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004), all in the -60kg weight division, to which a gold medal at the 1997 World Championships in Paris must also be added, among so many other achievements. Behind the medals and the public face, there is also a man who has a lot to say. As the Tokyo Olympic Games are fast approaching, we asked him to comment on his illustrious career and to tell us something of his own judo philosophy.We all know how difficult it is to win an Olympic title. It requires years of preparation and dedication. When one athlete wins the Olympic grail, this is already a fantastic achievement, that often concludes a brilliant career. This, when the same athlete steps up for the second time to the top of the podium, is extraordinary, but when it happens for the third time and a row, there are no words to describe what it really represents.Keeping the motivation throughout such a long period of time is an aspect of Nomura's career that is the most incredible, “I started judo at a young age, when I was just three years old and I grew up within a judo family. As a child I was not strong, but when I arrived at my first Olympic Games, in Atlanta, I was 21, almost 22 and I was full of energy. My first Olympic gold changed my life and especially in judo, because once I became Olympic champion, everybody started to look at me and to study me. I had to work harder to remain on top and that was my first definable motivation.The whole process to go to the Olympic Games is very long and tiring. It is so difficult, but that motivated me. When I became Olympic champion for the second time, in Sydney, I felt that I had achieved something, but I was getting older and I needed a break in my career. I stopped for two years. I didn't know if I could make it again, so I started to travel and I went to San Francisco. There I was not a professional athlete anymore. I was free from the pressure and I learned a lot during those two years, especially when working with children. Actually that's what gave me the motivation to go for another term. After this break, I was missing the pressure of high level competition and was gaining energy from the young people I was working with. I found the extra motivation to start again with the whole preparation process.""Throughout the discussion with Tadahiro Nomura, it became clear that the youth had been the guideline that allowed him to succeed and that today he wants to dedicate even more time to the educational dimension of judo. Before digging into that subject more, we wanted to know if there was a secret to such longevity. When asked, Nomura-San started to answer by mentioning another champion, one who might be able to join him soon with three Olympic titles, “Teddy has already earned two Olympic titles, so if he wins this summer in Tokyo, he will have three Olympic golds as well, but he already has ten world titles, which is absolutely incredible. One half of me wants him to win because that would be fantastic for judo, but the other half wants Japan to win! What I want to tell him is that he needs to put all he has on the mat, with no regrets. Becoming Olympic Champion is not easy. One needs to cultivate a passion for judo and learn to love it. This is my secret. Throughout my life I've learned to love judo. Of course, there is a technical dimension. I've developed my capacity to throw with my special technique, seoi-nage, but beyond that, there is my love for the whole sport. As a Japanese judoka, I believe that it is very important to foster courteousness to the opponent and what I call the 'rei', which is based on respect and mutual prosperity.""A champion is the one who steps on top of the medal podium and who gets all the attention, but behind every man and woman who wins there are many contributors. One of Nomura's main architects was Shinji Hosokawa, Olympic and world champion. ""I met Hosokawa-Sensei at the University in Tenri and he changed my judo career forever. He would always tell me that it is not enough to train hard, but you need to train to win and for that you need to be clever and consistent. The secret is quality. Everyday when I was training I was thinking about the Olympic Games and I was imagining how it would be to lose, so I was prepared. Hosokawa-Sensei was always beside me. He helped me to enjoy judo training, to have fun, but at the same time to feel the pressure and the risk of losing. When I arrived in Atlanta and he was sitting in the coaches’ chair, I felt good and ready. I admire him because throughout his life he has continued improving and learning. He speaks English and French and he travelled a lot. He became a great champion before becoming a great coach and he is a great man as well, on and off the tatami. He's an example.""Today Tadahiro Nomura is never far away from judo. Being a well known TV announcer in Japan, he is also a public speaker who is keen to share his experience to help young people and athletes to reach their dreams. With the Tokyo Olympics just over the horizon, he is also in charge of two young judoka, who we all know very well, “I've been working with the Abe siblings for a while already. Abe Uta and Abe Hifumi are two great athletes. Normally in Japan, you become really famous once you have won the Olympic titles, which is not their case yet, but they are already well known in the country. They are exposed and I am there to help them and to guide them so they can benefit from the best training conditions as well as the best media presence. Beside my TV occupation and the Abes, I also organise judo clinics in and out of Japan, although with the global pandemic it is not possible to travel for the moment. Since I retired, I spend most of my time in a suit and tie. I miss the judogi, so whenever it's possible I like to go back on the tatami. Every time I have the chance to travel and participate in a judo clinic, I am happy. I feel that people respect me for my achievements, but I mostly feel the passion that judoka around the world have for our sport.""To understand a little bit more about the secret of the great champion, we need to understand better where he is coming from and what, at one point, made him reach the summit. ""As I said, I started judo at a very young age. My whole family was involved in judo. My grandfather founded a small family dojo named Houtokukan Nomura Dojo. My father was a successful high school judo coach. Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura. I can say that it was part of our daily life and when I started practising, the spirit of my grandfather inhabited our dojo. I don't remember having seen him on the tatami, but I remember his smile, always a happy face. You know, the key was the fun. In the Nomura dojo we had fun! Personally speaking, I had fun, even if I was crying a lot too, because I was not so strong and I was losing a lot. I didn't like that. When I entered middle school I was only 32kg and nobody believed I would be a good judoka, even if I wanted to be the best. When I was 12 or 13 I wanted to be a hero of the sport, but that was far beyond my reach. So I decided to take it step by step. When I turned 17 and I watched the Barcelona Olympic Games, I wanted to be there, but I had the feeling that those athletes on TV were on another planet. Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion. I realised that maybe I had a chance. When I was young I was losing a lot, mainly because I was competing against heavier judoka, but throughout all those loses, I've learned a lot. That was when I started to improve my technique, because I needed to find solutions.""Discovering the solutions to become better, through failures and defeats, is an important factor in Nomura's future success and this is exactly what he wants to transmit to the next generation of judoka, ""I would love now to have my own dojo where I could teach young children the secret to becoming a true judoka. But then the global pandemic started and I had to adapt. So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’. So, for the time being, I organise some judo classes online, on YouTube. Discover more at: CLICK HERE It's a nice way to interact with the judo community. For the moment I do it in Japan, but I'd be happy to share it beyond Japan. I am really looking forward to being back with children on the tatami again."" When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension. ""Some years ago, I travelled to France, with Uemura-Sensei and the Kodokan. I had the feeling that I knew a lot about the sport side of judo, but there I started to understand a little better what jita kyoei meant. Ok, so judo is an element of budo, with one person facing another and one of them winning, but judo is much more than that. It is a form of education. Judo carries real values that are all embedded in the bow, the rei. I want to keep learning more about that and I want to communicate more as well. This is what makes judo different from any other activity. This is what Jigoro Kano gave us. When you are an athlete it is not easy to think about education. When I was a child I wanted to win. Parents and teachers want their children to win, but before that we should teach them to love judo for what it is: a beautiful educational tool and a fun activity. After my career, I realised that for me it was not always fun to be on the tatami and to train hard. It was difficult, but every time it was really hard, I would remember the fun I had when I was a child and then suddenly everything would become easier. I started to process all I've learned, but I still have a lot to discover and this is what I want to do now.I admire all the projects that the IJF does, like Judo for Children and Judo for Peace. These are fantastic ideas because they bring to the masses a dimension of judo invented by Jigoro Kano Shihan himself. All these programmes offer possibilities for everyone to shine through judo and find their own answers to the challenges that we have to face. I know the power of judo and I'm really identifying myself within that. Over the past years, the number of judoka in Japan has decreased but I'm happy to see that it's increasing on the whole, around the world, thanks to the educational programmes that are set up. I believe that it is also through education that we will find solutions in my country."" We could listen to Tadahiro Nomura for hours but time flies and everyone has to jump on the next meeting in our busy timetables. We had just a few more minutes to get a conclusion, ""I have one regret, that I could not win a fourth Olympic title. I thought it was possible. I was ready but then I went to a training camp where I got injured and I had to stop. What I can tell you is that throughout my career I've learned a lot and I'm still learning a lot. I want now to make my own contribution, not as an athlete, but as an educator. I may be a champion, but I still need to study more and more. Judo is not only about the medals, it is much more than that.""","['judo', 'started', 'learn', 'japan', 'olympic', 'world', 'lot', 'nomura', 'young', 'champion', 'judoka']",2021-05-10,,ijf.org,EUREX

Here’s why.,"The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low.It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks.The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous?","Oops.As a former Federal Reserve chair herself, now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen should have known that her comments about the possibility of a need for an interest-rate hike would send markets into a tizzy, and by the end of the day she had walked back her remarks. No matter, as they’d brought about a classic rotation — the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.09% dived 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.36% actually rose slightly.What was interesting was that the bond market didn’t follow suit. The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low. It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates. The currency market wasn’t volatile. So maybe the stock market was vulnerable to selling.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks. The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.The hedge-fund selling was most concentrated in the communications-services and information-technology sectors, according to the BofA data — i.e., the tech winners that have thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Who’s buying? Retail clients were the only group to buy U.S. equities for the third week in a row and have been net buyers for 10 straight weeks, per Bank of America.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous? Well, the April payrolls report on Friday is expected to be a seven-digit affair, after nearly topping a million in March. Even with Federal Reserve policy makers at pains to dismiss signs of surging inflation, they can’t ignore a rapidly healing labor market, so official data showing a surge in jobs creation will inevitably cause market discussion of when the central bank will pull back on its bond buying.“As usual, it looks like the connection between legacy ‘duration proxy’ tech sector/’secular growth’ is the risk into the next two months of ‘peak’ U.S. economic data base-effect, with this week’s heavy U.S. data slate culminating in the CRITICAL Friday NFP, which is expected to be a WHOPPING +++ print and is set to dictate the timing of Fed ‘tapering’ socialization,” said Nomura Securities strategist Charlie McElligott.How whopping? Steve Englander, head of global G-10 currency strategy at Standard Chartered, said a payrolls number in excess of 2 million would scare investors, and anything above 1.5 million would cause “uncertainty.” In other words, the risk is that by Friday, traders might be talking like Yellen did on Tuesday.GM tops forecastsADP reported a 742,000 rise in private-sector payrolls for April, which was below economist expectations.

Nomura,4,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-nomura-still-betting-global-060747202.html,"Japan's Nomura still betting on global expansion to lift profit, despite Archegos hit","According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

This series highlights the 10 most compelling papers with ‘practitioner takeaways’ by BNP Paribas Asset Management investment professionals. We sponsor GRASFI to bring academic rigour to the pressing challenges of sustainable finance and investment. Our goal is to share these reflections with clients and the industry. We invite you to visit the GRASFI Conference website.""Sustainability in the time of uncertaintyThe COVID-19 pandemic had a profound and immediate effect on global stock markets. The US S&P 500 equity index fell by 33.6% between 20 February and 23 March 2020 in US dollar terms as lockdown measures were enacted across much of the developed world to contain the virus.[2]As markets rebounded on news of huge fiscal and monetary stimulus from governments and central bank support, investors piled back into equities. It was notable that sustainable funds drew significant inflows[3] on hopes of a ‘green recovery’.As investment approaches centring on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors grow more popular, understanding how assets perform in adverse market conditions is a key test of the viability of these strategies.In the white paper ‘Sustainability in the time of uncertainty’, the authors have analysed the performance of S&P 1500 companies during last year’s crash.US stocks scoring higher on ESG factors by rating agencies OWL Analytics and TruValue Labs demonstrated ‘significantly higher’ returns over the period, the study reports – particularly during the first few ‘extreme’ days of the market turmoil.Sustainability componentsThe study decomposes ESG scores based on three ‘components’ to explain performance:UncertaintyInvestor sentiment‘Idiosyncratic sustainability factor’.The last of these was the strongest factor, the authors report.To analyse uncertainty, the authors use the ‘Knightian uncertainty’ measure to differentiate between risks and ambiguities. Knightian uncertainty explains situations in which information is known, but the outcome is not, and situations in which not all information is available[4] – effectively, ‘known unknowns’ and ‘unknown unknowns’.The study plots ESG scores against nine measures of risk and uncertainty based on data from January 2017 to June 2019. Of these, seven demonstrate a ‘clear pattern’, namely that stocks rated the highest for ESG qualities ‘on average exhibited less risk ex post than the lowest rated ESG stocks’.The authors also report a link between investor trust in sustainability factors and stock resilience, indicating that investors value companies with strong sustainability qualities during times of market stress.This is based on two analyses of ESG scores and company performance, one controlling for financial performance metrics linked to ESG factors, and the other for risk and sentiment measures.Those companies with higher ESG scores usually demonstrate lower risk and higher sentiment scores, with the risk element the more obvious factor, the authors report.The idiosyncratic sustainability factorOn top of the risk and sentiment factors, there is a third residual factor identified by the researchers feeding into performance during crisis periods.By drilling down into the various elements of ‘E’, ‘S’ and ‘G’, the authors report that individual factors have a particularly strong bearing on the performance of individual stocks. These include companies’ performance onPollution preventionStaff pay and job satisfactionDiversity and workers’ rights.During February-March this year, companies with higher scores on these metrics are shown to have performed better than the market average, demonstrating the role these factors play in a company’s resilience to market shocks.“Overall, these results suggest that the residual ESG component carries important information regarding firms’ sustainability conduct, particularly in the governance space, that cannot be explained with market risk or sentiment,” the authors state.The authors put their findings to the test through experiments with groups of investors tested during bull and bear market conditions – 23-30 November 2019, and 13-20 March 2020.The tests were designed to assess attitudes to risk and uncertainty. They included one group of investors given financial information and another given additional sustainability information.Before the 2020 crash, there was no difference between the two groups, but when tested last March, participants clearly preferred lower risk investments.In addition, risk-averse individuals with access to ESG information were shown to be more likely to allocate more to equity during the market plunge than other risk-averse investors who were not given ESG information.This latter finding is in line with the idea that companies with higher ESG scores are seen as lower risk investments.At a time when more money than ever before is flowing into sustainable investments, the paper identifies behavioural factors and underlying drivers of company performance that show clearly that companies with strong ESG credentials can perform well in times of uncertainty.Commenting on the paper, Alex Bernhardt, global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said:“This paper highlights the positive link between companies with a strong sustainability performance and business resilience by evaluating share price performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found that companies with strong sustainability characteristics are considered lower risk investments – this is aligned with our view that a strong performance on material ESG issues can help companies mitigate risk.”Also read these blog articles on ‘GRASFI papers’:More on sustainable investingAny views expressed here are those of the author as of the date of publication, are based on available information, and are subject to change without notice.

REUTERS/Giorgio PerottinoConcise insights on global finance.-----------------------------------------------CALM BEFORE THE STORM. Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) has bolstered its bad credit defences. Italy’s largest lender on Wednesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit of 1.5 billion euros . It’s the bank’s best quarter since 2008, delivering an annualised return on tangible equity of 12%, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The performance owes much to lower bad debt provisions. Intesa set aside some 400 million euros, equivalent to 0.35% of total loans on an annualised basis. That’s less than some European rivals.Boss Carlo Messina and investors know the lull won’t last. Intesa shares trade at around 0.8 times its tangible book value, implying an 8% return on tangible equity this year. Once Italy lifts a ban on layoffs, many private clients will default. Yet, as consumer credit accounts for just 6% of its loans, less than half the equivalent share for BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Intesa is better placed to weather an increase in defaults.

Shareholders in Société Générale (SOGN.PA) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are unaccustomed to good news. The perennial European bank laggards bucked the habit on Thursday with blowout first-quarter results. Frédéric Oudéa’s French lender reported a juicy 10.1% return on tangible equity, after stripping out one-off charges. UniCredit’s new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel unveiled a less stellar but still respectable 6.9% ROTE, also on an underlying basis. Both banks’ shares rose 4%.It’s unlikely to last. Both Oudéa and Orcel expect bad-debt charges to rise in the rest of the year. Revenues from investment banking will probably fall as market volatility subsides. Meanwhile analysts reckon SocGen’s costs will consume 73% of 2021 income, compared with BNP Paribas’ (BNPP.PA) 68%. UniCredit’s equivalent ratio of 58% is much worse than Intesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP.MI) 52%. Little wonder the French and Italian banks respectively trade at a 38% and 54% discount to their two closest rivals, using price to forward tangible book value. Oudéa and Orcel will remain stuck at the bottom of the class.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe five-year breakeven inflation rate - which measures expectations of inflation five years out - reached its highest since April 2011 on Monday. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate - a measure of expectations of inflation in 10 years time - rose to its highest since March 2013.A weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday helped persuade market participants that the Fed would keep rates low and continue purchasing assets, even if inflation rises. The United States created a little more than a quarter of the jobs that economists had forecast last month and the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher.“I think the biggest problem for the dollar right now is what’s happening to real yields, which continue to tumble. We’re seeing inflation breakevens continue to push higher,” said Daniel Katzive, head of foreign exchange strategy North America at BNP Paribas. “This is creating a lot of vulnerability for the dollar.”In recent years, rising inflation expectations have helped the dollar because investors have assumed interest rates would be raised in response to higher prices.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was last at 90.205, up 0.06% on the day, having earlier hit its lowest since Feb. 25.The market this week will be focused on U.S. consumer price data reported Wednesday as well as retail sales on Friday. Wednesday’s CPI data will show the state of inflation today, and while that may have some effect on the market, the higher breakeven rates seen Monday reflect broader bets that inflation will rise in the next several years.“The Fed will let inflation run hot into 2023. I would be so shocked if the Fed hiked interest rates in 2022,” said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.The British pound was the biggest gainer among the G10 currencies, rallying as high as $1.416, the highest since Feb. 25. It was last up 1.02% at $1.413. This was despite Scotland’s leader saying that another referendum on independence is inevitable after her party’s resounding election victory.Also benefiting was the Canadian dollar, which was 0.36% stronger on the day to $1.209, the highest since September 2017.In cryptocurrencies, ether extended this month’s record run, surging to an unprecedented $4,148.88.

REUTERS/Kacper PempelWhen Polish IT specialist Przemyslaw Rowinski's wife died in 2013, he was left alone in the central Warsaw flat which they bought together in 2005 with a mortgage in Swiss francs whose repayments soon shot up.In 2015, the franc - already appreciating against the zloty - skyrocketed as the Swiss central bank removed a currency cap.""I was left alone with this mortgage,"" Rowinski told Reuters in the 10th-floor flat overlooking the capital's old town. ""The removal of the cap on the franc -- it was a shock... the instalments jumped by 100%.""Thousands of Polish borrowers took out the loans more than a decade ago to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates but faced higher costs when the zloty slumped.Many, like Rowinski, have decided to take the banks to court over clauses they say are abusive and the problem could cost the banking sector over 200 billion zlotys ($53 billion) in worst-case scenario estimates.

""If the banks start to propose some sensible... conversion maybe I will lean towards that, not suing the bank.""In December, the head of Poland's financial market regulator KNF proposed a plan for banks to convert foreign currency loans into zlotys as if they had been taken out in the local currency originally.However, so far only the nation's largest lender PKO BP has committed itself to settlements, with others waiting for Tuesday's guidance.""If the Supreme Court guidance is unfavourable for the banks, they will need to increase their provisioning against losses related to these mortgages and may lose bargaining power in out of court settlements,"" ratings agency Moody's said in a recent note.The KNF estimates that the cost to banks of court cases could be between 70.5 billion and 234 billion zlotys, while the cost of its settlement plan would be 34.5 billion zlotys.The Polish banking sector had a net profit of 7.7 billion zlotys in 2020.""In the blackest scenario... the banking sector is seriously threatened, a situation in which some banks are insolvent is possible,"" said Tadeusz Bialek, deputy head of the Polish Bank Association (ZBP).Rowinski hopes the Supreme Court will give a clear line for judgements.

Featuring a closer look at the way in which companies stand out, CEOs, Directors and other c-level executives elaborate on what it takes to turn a great idea into a great company.Yann Arnaud is President of the Steering Committee on AVs for a Movin’On Community of Interest project. He explains here how autonomous vehicles can bring life and economic dynamism back to the parts of France that need it most. Yann is also Chairman of the Digital Commission and the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles working group of the French Insurance Federation.We need to think differently about AVsMention ‘Autonomous Vehicle’ and most people picture a man – probably white and possibly a busy executive – reading the news, or replying to emails, while his luxury electric vehicle navigates the traffic by itself. This reality is already upon us, with many automakers releasing Level 3 (conditional automation) vehicles into the market.According to this image, AVs are a natural continuation of the classic single-car-ownership model; i.e. a technological disruption that does not address the social and economic issues of our day.The Movin’On Community of Interest is a working group that brings together several ecosystem stakeholders to develop a common vision and experiment new mobility solutions togethers. We are leading one of them, dedicated to shifting the discussion away from technological advance for its own sake and toward the use of technology to promote social good.Movin’On toward sustainable and inclusive mobilityMovin’On, created and inspired by Michelin, is gathering collective and individual change makers and giving them the means to innovate together for more mobility with less impact. Besides Macif and Michelin, there are other major players from the private sector involved in the Community of Interest to recontextualize mobility innovation in terms of social impact. These include BNP Paribas Cardif, Deloitte, Faurecia, Kantar, Maif, Microsoft, Orange, SNCF and Vinci; as well as key actors from government, civil society and the scientific community.Movin’On has numerous interdisciplinary teams within its LAB, a think and do tank, engaged in answering questions like: ‘How to reshape last mile delivery operations and experience for good?’ and ‘How can we securely share data to create value and improve sustainable mobility?’. Our Community of Interest is dedicated to answering: ‘How can we encourage the adoption of autonomous vehicles through sustainable and inclusive mobility insights?’.Technopush versus Social SolidarityIn 2020, we participated in studies carried out by the Védécom Institute, who specialise in the subject of mobility and autonomy. One of our striking findings was that there is overwhelming bias in the media and the popular imagination for ‘technopush’, whereby technology – not social good – drives interest and publicity. Of the 100 000 or so articles on AVs we came across, only 185 discussed the social impact of this new technology and the possibilities for inclusive and sustainable transport.It’s a bit like social media, which was first seen as an unvarnished good, before – as Gartner’s Hype Cycle describes it – the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ gave way to the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’. Our research suggests that the French public intuits the potential for disillusionment; they’re prepared to support AVs, so long as they prove to be safe and that they expand employment opportunities and reduce environmental impact.Interestingly, rural areas were less supportive of AVs. But if we have our way, these environments will benefit greatly from cheap, efficient, carbon-light solutions to getting around, finding work and building communities.AVs as a solution to economic decline in sparsely populated areasHow can we convince the public, as well as major institutional players, that the real opportunity for AVs is not as a continuation of the traditional mobility model, but as a positive disruption that boosts local economies and expands access to millions of the underserved? This notion is encapsulated in our Movin’On Community of Interest motto: ‘Mobility for all, Autonomy for all’.We believe this can be achieved by using AV technology for shared electric shuttles that mix on-demand elements of ride-hailing with traditional public transport elements of routes and timetables. If a country like France – which has large areas that are sparsely populated – can get this right, it will do unimaginable good for those outlying towns, villages and suburbs where millions find their lives and livelihoods constrained by lack of mobility options.I live in Coulonges-sur-L’Autize, a small village 25-minutes’ drive north of MACIF’s headquarters in Niort. It’s a joy to live close to a Regional Natural Park (Marais Poitevin) and not too far from the beauty spots along the Bay of Biscay coastline. And yet I see that a village or small town can be a prison for those – be they a single mother or elderly couple – without ready access to mobility.We will know that the initiative has succeeded when we’ve increased the sharing of assets, decreased environmental impact, and rejuvenated business and social activity in the high street, particularly for smaller towns and villages.The commercial viability of autonomous vehiclesIf shared autonomous shuttles really are key to reversing the decline of peri-urban areas, then why don’t we see the big OEMs talking more about it? Clearly, the commercial argument for the solution has not been properly made. Our committee is of the opinion that not only can AVs improve mobility access for underserved areas, but that the model is commercially viable.Currently, AVs are expensive because the data and intelligence must be self-contained in the vehicle. But if AVs operated within a geofenced area, along discrete routes and supervised centrally, then the intelligence and data would be shared across the system, reducing costs. If this solution for a certain suburb or village proves to be scalable, then it means we could duplicate the model across the country.Explore, prepare, testOur Community of Interest began in 2020 and rolls out of three yearly phases: explore, prepare and test. By 2022 we should be able to verify if indeed a replicable model for widespread AV use in sparse areas is possible. In the meantime, it’s important that insurance companies like Macif consider the risk and liability problems posed by AVs.In the future, it’s possible that an autonomous system will reduce accident risk to zero. But current reality says AVs and non-AVs are going to be operating on the same roads for some years to come. With fears around automation and artificial intelligence relegating humans to irrelevance, it is important that a company like Macif – which was founded for mutual benefit in protection of life, family and property – leads the discussion.AVs are set to disrupt millions of truck-driving, delivery and ride-hailing jobs. We need to think about how technology can ameliorate the digital divide and expand opportunities to those on the margins of economic activity. There is no reason why a country like France cannot use AVs to boost economic dynamism and social activity in sparsely populated areas, improving the lives of millions.Do EVs excite your electrons?

BNP Paribas,5,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activepure-technology-partners-bnp-paribas-163000072.html,ActivePure Technology Partners with BNP Paribas Real Estate Netherlands,"According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

Not so in Asia though, where MSCI Inc.’s key gauge for this category of shares has returned more than 9 per cent so far this year, beating the broader regional benchmark by almost five percentage points.The index, which excludes the Japanese market and is heavily weighted to financials, information technology and materials companies, has also outperformed value stocks, a favorite of many investors the world over this year. Reasons for the strength range from a recovery in banks on expectations for higher interest rates to the rally in Taiwanese tech stocks.“We expect economic growth to rebound strongly in the next 2-3 years, potentially achieving its highest rate for decades as pent up demand is released and policy settings remain expansionary,” said Jeffrey Roskell, a portfolio manager for the JPMorgan Asia Equity Dividend Fund. “Profitability and dividends are set to recover.”The outperformance of stocks with better income potential has also come as confidence in the outlook returns to company boardrooms in Asia, with about 45 per cent of stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index resuming or increasing dividends this year versus the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That said, the ratio is almost 10 percentage points higher for the S&P 500 Index.More recently, however, Asia’s high-dividend-yield stocks have seen their outperformance over the broader market fade.Manishi Raychaudhuri, BNP Paribas SA ’s Asia-Pacific head of equity research, said investors should be selective, cautioning that the dividend theme tends to underperform when bond yields rise and the hunt for returns see investors move into areas like investment grade fixed income.Among top dividend-yielding sectors, his team expects financials and materials to have room to increase earnings. By contrast, there are doubts about the earnings and payout sustainability of Chinese property and office real estate investment trusts, Raychaudhuri said.Roskell’s fund, which has a yield of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent and has outperformed the regional benchmark so far this year, has been rotating out of defensive stocks into value names lately on expectations of early economic recovery and higher interest rates.Some others are more optimistic.“The dividend-paying element in a stock points us to quality -- a synonym of balance sheet resilience and stability in operations,” said Frank Tsui, a senior fund manager at Value Partners who is involved in the firm’s high-dividend strategy. Investing in dividend stocks “makes sense” in the current environment, he said.Tsui sees growing interest in China’s dividend story, in sectors ranging from white goods to property developers.
