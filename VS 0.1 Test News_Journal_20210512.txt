REUTERS/Mike SegarBy Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Brexit forced Britain to relinquish 2.3 trillion pounds ($3.25 trillion) in monthly derivatives trading, leaving New York the global winner in a shake-up of that market, consultants Deloitte and data company IHS Markit said in a report on Tuesday.Britain left the European Union's full legal orbit on Dec. 31 and the UK financial sector's access to the bloc is now limited.Banks and other market participants in the EU are no longer allowed to use platforms in London to trade swaps, while Brussels has given the United States permission to serve EU investors.Initial figures in January showed that chunks of trading in interest rate swaps left London for EU and US platforms, and the report on Tuesday confirmed that trend has become embedded.Market share for euro swaps alone in London fell from just under 40% in July 2020 to about 10% in March, while on EU platforms it rose from 10% to 26%, and in the United States from less than 10% to 19%.

However, other clearinghouses such as Eurex and ICE operate under a vertical model meaning that derivatives traded on their exchanges must be cleared through their own CCPs.The implementation of open access has been hit by several delays. In June, the European Parliament confirmed the regime would be delayed for one year until July 2021 just two weeks before it was due to imposed because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“HM Treasury has concluded that the open access regime for ETDs, which was originally designed to improve cross-border capital markets in the EU, is not suitable in a UK-only context,” said the HM Treasury in its statement.The Treasury added the open access regime will remain in place for equity and over the counter derivatives, and that it will conduct a broader review of the wholesale financial markets to increase future openness and competitiveness.“This ruling further evidence of the negative consequences of the UK leaving the EU. The UK had originally been all for open access, allowing for market participants in exchange traded derivatives the freedom of choice for clearing their contracts,” Vuk Magdelinic, chief executive of Overbond, commented on the development.“With Brexit however, and in spite of the advantages of such a regime across Europe from a free flow-of-capital perspective, the Treasury undoubtedly viewed these to be largely nullified when implemented on a stand-alone national basis.”The decision to remove open access is the latest move in a series of regulatory divergence by the UK away from EU law following Brexit. In April, the UK Chancellor set out ambitious capital markets reforms that included the removal of the double volume caps (DVCs) relating to dark trading and the share trading obligation.While last week it was confirmed that certain research rules and best execution reporting requirements under MiFID II could be axed in the UK.","['eu', 'scraps', 'divergence', 'confirmed', 'treasury', 'latest', 'uk', 'regulatory', 'derivatives', 'trading', 'markets', 'regime', 'open', 'access']",2021-05-07,thetradenews.com,EUREX
EUREX,0,Google API,https://www.thetradenews.com/clearing-post-brexit-what-happens-now/,Clearing post-Brexit: What happens now?,"A battle for clearingThe battle to win euro-denominated derivatives clearing activity, a business worth some $660 trillion, is one of the fiercest between UK and EU regulators.Currently, London is the home to derivatives clearing, with most of the activity going through LCH.A temporary 18-month equivalence for UK clearing houses was enacted in September 2020, enabling LCH to continue providing euro-denominated clearing services from January 2021 until June 2022.This 25% chunk of euro-derivatives clearing is not a “viable” amount for the EU to process, Bailey explained to MPs.Going forward, the UK and EU will most likely stay in close contact when formulating and implementing financial services regulation.","When the UK and EU announced their last-minute post-Brexit agreement and there was little to no mention of financial services, the eventual divergence on trading regulation was inevitable.Early signs of the UK’s split from EU regulations came last year when the UK Treasury confirmed it would not implement the Settlement Discipline Regime (SDR), set out under the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR).UK Ministers are now reportedly planning to overhaul MiFID II, the EU’s main financial services legislation, as it looks to hold onto its place as a global financial centre. Changes could include scrapping the share trading obligation, which forced more than €6 billion a day of EU-denominated stocks out of London to European-based venues mainly in Amsterdam.With the UK and EU to set out separate paths on financial regulation, there are various implications this could have on the post-trade landscape alongside potential unintended consequences that may arise for firms.A battle for clearingThe battle to win euro-denominated derivatives clearing activity, a business worth some $660 trillion, is one of the fiercest between UK and EU regulators. Currently, London is the home to derivatives clearing, with most of the activity going through LCH. Despite moves from Eurex, the Frankfurt-based exchange group, to lure activity from London, LCH has maintained its hold of the market.A temporary 18-month equivalence for UK clearing houses was enacted in September 2020, enabling LCH to continue providing euro-denominated clearing services from January 2021 until June 2022.However, tensions are heating up between regulators, and it appears equivalence will not be extended beyond 2022. In February, the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey warned over a “serious escalation” in relations with the UK if Brussels attempts to force banks to move all clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the Eurozone.In his speech to the UK Treasury Committee, Bailey highlighted how the consequence of no further equivalence decisions at the end of the 18-month period would mean that a quarter of euro-derivatives clearing would move from the UK to the EU. This 25% chunk of euro-derivatives clearing is not a “viable” amount for the EU to process, Bailey explained to MPs.“The reason is, particularly in an activity like clearing where the efficiency really comes from having a very big pool of derivatives that can be netted and cleared down, by splitting that pool up the whole process becomes less efficient and having the smaller part of the pool would be even less efficient,” he said. “The clearinghouses also involve a certain level of cross-currency netting to go on and that would break down as well.”To obtain the remaining three-quarters of total euro-denominated derivatives activity, Bailey said the EU could potentially “force or cajole banks and dealers to say there will be some other penalty unless you move this clearing activity into the EU”.This, he warned, would create “a very serious escalation of the issue” and was something that the UK should “resist very firmly”. Activity has not yet shifted from the UK, as banks await clarity on what is to come.“The situation is unclear on what will develop after June 2022, and we have clear messages from the Commission to move euro-denominated contracts/products to EU-located CCPs,” says Haroun Boucheta, head of regulatory affairs at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “The industry has pressure from the Commission to work closely on operational solutions to migrate euro business, using EU27 CCPs.”Post-trade fragmentationThe lack of cross-border equivalence for not only clearing, but also settlement of securities, means clear lines have been drawn between UK and European post-trade venues. Banks are concerned about the impact of fragmentation on costs for clearing and settlement.The costs will come from investment firms and banks having to adapt their technology infrastructure to manage a dual post-trade framework. Larger-sized firms may be able to absorb these costs, but it will make barriers to entry for smaller-sized firms even harder to overcome. As a result, some asset managers could be forced to operate in just one jurisdiction.“Firms have broadly adopted a model where you have one system, but you guide the trade processing to different venues, with localised processing funnels,” says Samir Pandiri, president at Broadridge International. “A very small second group are firms who basically decided they didn’t have the scale in either the UK or the Continent to make it worthwhile preparing to continue service in that jurisdiction.“Post-trade solutions need to take into account three variables: trading in multiple geographies, clients in different jurisdictions and where the post-trade processing is actually done. We did a lot of one-off configuration with new client entities since 2016, and that’s all been working well. But the Brexit work is also enabling a broader re-set on post-trade, with providers needing much more flexible/customisable systems to keep competitive.“With trading volumes moving around between venues, post-trade services must now offer much more price flexibility and more variable cost, which will act as a further stimulus to mutualisation. The increased complexity also highlights the necessity of better data models, to spot inefficiencies, such the costs of a fail for example.”Regulatory fragmentationAs outlined, the UK is seeking to overhaul certain European regulations to make itself a more attractive financial services centre. It could appear that the UK is taking a different approach to post-trade regulation, following its decision to not implement the SDR rules. It did, however, state it will consider the future approach of the rules to the UK’s own post-trade framework.The danger here for firms is that regulatory fragmentation could require double the amount of work and resources to stay compliant in both jurisdictions.“With the UK opting out of CSDR, there will be separate regimes around settlement discipline,” highlights Reto Faber, head of direct custody and clearing for EMEA at Citi. “It may look to align with some aspects of CSDR, but right now it looks like there will be a dual system affecting cross-listed shares. This is going to bring additional and duplicated costs, as well as increased complexity to deal with multiple regimes.”That being said, the decision by the UK to implement CSDR differently could provide a glimmer of hope for banks and investment managers that the EU will review its contentious mandatory buy-in regime.“Fragmentation is going to come on a wider scale throughout the year. With the UK implementing SDR separately, the regulation may come back to the table very differently where they could make the buy-in optional rather than mandatory,” says Linda Gibson, head of regulatory change at BNY Mellon’s Pershing.“But the market is waiting on how the UK will implement SDR, causing some operational challenges to firms that are international. Those that have project plans in place are working on the EU regime, so the challenge is to anticipate how different the UK will be.”The European Commission recently closed its consultation of CSDR and is set to publish the findings of its review in the second quarter. Many are hoping European regulators will do away with the buy-in regime (which seems highly unlikely) or implement it on a discretionary basis.As a result, European regulators could opt for more favourable changes so that it is more aligned with the UK.“We have pushed for a voluntary buy-in regime rather than a mandatory one, and specific exemptions in terms of products and operations which should be out of the scope of the SDR,” says Boucheta. “The UK move not to implement the full CSDR rules will bring the attention from EU regulators, and it is a good thing to help us push our various points.”In addition, Broadridge’s Pandiri believes that regulators will eventually look to align their respective frameworks that can preserve the flow of securities processing and post-trade activities.“While it looks like regulatory fragmentation at present, I do see this as a ‘creation moment’ for things coming back together, as practical market innovation starts to produce more fungible solutions that actually make securities processing easier across markets,” Pandiri says.Going forward, the UK and EU will most likely stay in close contact when formulating and implementing financial services regulation. The UK has been a leading voice for many of the post-financial crisis regulations, and it is hoped their expertise will continue to be leveraged.“The UK played a very important role in Brussels, and though it is no longer directly involved, it should carry on discussions for securities services regulations to avoid unintended consequences,” Boucheta concludes.This article was featured in the Spring 2021 edition of The TRADE magazine.","['eu', 'regulators', 'implement', 'clearing', 'services', 'activity', 'posttrade', 'securities', 'postbrexit', 'uk', 'happens', 'regulation']",2021-05-08,thetradenews.com,EUREX

The coal plants are expected to be built in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Madagascar, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea and Vietnam.“The tens of thousands of cases of death and disease that would result from HSBC-linked coal power plants underline the urgency of shifting investments to clean energy to protect public health and the global climate,” Myllyvirta said.HSBC bowed to investor pressure over its support for fossil fuels earlier this year by vowing to phase out its financing of coal-fired power and coal mining by 2030 in developed economies, and by 2040 elsewhere in the world.However, the pledge will not extend to HSBC’s $612bn asset management arm, which is expected to continue investing in companies with plans to build coal power plants in developing countries.An HSBC spokesperson said the asset management arm, which often invests based on index-linked funds that include fossil fuel companies, does not invest directly in coal-fired power plants or coal mining-related infrastructure.“In line with our commitment to the Paris agreement, HSBC Global Asset Management has a policy on responsible investment. We prioritise high carbon sectors for early engagement and action to improve governance, targets, and disclosure of climate risk,” the spokesperson added.The scale of HSBC’s ongoing investment in coal through its asset management division was first revealed by Market Forces in a report earlier this year. Adam McGibbon, a lead campaigner at Market Forces, said although HSBC’s plans to keep investing in companies were understood, the “devastating human cost of these plants” was revealed in Crea’s report.“Coal plants mean death and HSBC, as an investor in these companies, are complicit. HSBC’s investments in such a huge number of new coal plant-building companies makes a mockery of their claim to support the Paris agreement. Ahead of their AGM and Cop26, HSBC must announce plans to phase out their ownership stakes in coal companies,” he said.HSBC will propose a special resolution on climate change at its AGM later this month, which will set out the next phase of the bank’s strategy to support its customers on the transition to net zero carbon emissions, including its pledge to phase out coal financing.The bank set out plans in October to reduce emissions in its operations and supply chain to net zero by 2030, and to align the bank’s financed emissions at a portfolio level to net zero by 2050 or sooner.","['power', 'plants', 'stakes', 'plan', 'management', 'firms', 'plans', 'asset', 'phase', 'hsbcs', 'companies', 'coal', 'support', '70', 'hsbc']",2021-05-12,theguardian.com,EUREX

This allows it to determine whether a caller is genuine. In order to use the service, customers need to register for it.According to HSBC, the voice biometrics system has identified over 43,000 fraudulent phone calls and protected £981 million worth of customers’ money.With the onset of the pandemic and increased uptake of digital services, additional customers have signed up for the bank’s caller ID scheme. Currently, it has around 2.8 million active users.HSBC UK Head of Contact Centre and Customer Service Kerri-Anne Mills said: “We’ve seen unprecedented challenges as the pandemic and lockdown restrictions transformed our lives significantly and, unsurprisingly, more people have turned to online and mobile banking to take control of their finances, utilising other channels for very particular interactions.“Voice ID has not only made telephone banking more convenient for customers accessing their accounts, but it has also been instrumental in stopping attempts at telephone banking fraud, protecting customers’ money.“Scammers are sophisticated and it’s a constant challenge to keep ahead of them but this is promising – we’ve seen a 50% drop in reported telephone banking fraud year-on-year. We are now enrolling around 14,000 customers in Voice ID each week and the technology continues to be instrumental in the fight against fraud, providing a library of fraudsters’ voice prints to cross check against new incoming calls.”RecommendedAs more people use online services to handle their finances, cybercrime becomes more lucrative. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new tricks and tactics to gain access to user data, and ultimately their money, whether through traditional schemes, accessing accounts or ransomware.As such, organisations need to develop new ways to protect customers data. New tools such as password managers, 2-factor authentication and systems like HSBC’s Voice ID are essential in staying one step ahead of the cybercriminals.However, cybercriminals have been leveraging the power of AI to put many of these new techniques at risk. One of the new methods available to hackers are vocal deepfakes. With a relatively small amount of information, an AI can be trained to generate a convincing imitation of a person’s voice.A well-trained and produced vocal deepfake could be used to trick a computer system. While many deepfakes are created using publicly available material, such as corporate videos to imitate a company’s CEO, a phone call from a scammer could gather information needed to create a deepfake.Like this: Like Loading...","['weve', 'half', 'cuts', 'customers', 'id', 'voice', 'caller', 'vocal', 'fraud', 'banking', 'system', 'telephone', 'hsbc']",2021-05-08,digit.fyi,EUREX

(0:31)CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Rory McIlroy finally won when he least expected it, and it was as sweet as he could have imagined.Only after he hung on for a one-shot victory in the Wells Fargo Championship, his first title in 18 months, did he reveal his neck locked up during his final practice session, and if not for a late tee time on Thursday he would have had to withdraw.When he seized control Sunday afternoon with back-to-back birdies from the bunker down the stretch, he started to get ahead of himself thinking how cool it would be to see his wife and 8-month-old daughter waiting to celebrate with him on their first Mother's Day.The finishing stretch at Quail Hollow snapped him back to reality. He hit a 7-iron safely over the water on the 17th, and caddie Harry Diamond wisely talked him into taking a penalty drop from a dangerous lie in a hazard on the closing hole. He two-putted from 45 feet for bogey, a 3-under 68 and a one-shot victory.The moment with Erica and little Poppy was what he imagined. So was that trophy.""It's tough to get over the line, especially if you haven't done it in a while,'' McIlroy said, a winner at Quail Hollow for the third time. ""It's such a funny week, knowing my game was pretty good and then having my neck lock up on the range and sitting here Sunday night with the trophy.""Just glad I got through it.''Abraham Ancer finished runner-up for the fourth time in his career as he seeks his first title. Ancer wasn't part of the picture until he ran off three straight birdies late that briefly gave him a share of the lead, and he nearly closed with a fourth birdie when his 35-foot putt on No. 18 grazed the lip. He shot 66.But this was about McIlroy -- who until this week had not played on the weekend in two months -- and the second-longest winless drought of his career.It was like he never was gone. McIlroy was bogey-free until the final hole, and even when he brought more pressure on himself with a poor tee shot, he delivered an 8-iron from just inside 200 yards to the fat of the green for his two-putt bogey to finish on 10-under 274.His last victory was the HSBC Champions in Shanghai on Nov. 3, 2019. His next start is in two weeks at Kiawah Island for the PGA Championship, where he set the record in 2012 with an eight-shot victory.How's that for timing?""I'm excited going forward now,'' McIlroy said.His game is not perfect -- he hit only three of 14 fairways in the final round -- but he was quick to say a victory brought validation.Locked in a tight race among Keith Mitchell, Gary Woodland and then Ancer, McIlroy delivered the goods on the back nine. He holed a 10-foot par putt on the par-3 13th. He got up-and-down for birdie with splendid bunker shots on the reachable par-4 14th and the par-5 15th.Rory McIlroy was able to celebrate his first victory in 18 months with his wife, Erica, and their 8-month-old daughter, Poppy, on their first Mother's Day. Tannen Maury/EPAMcIlroy won for the 19th time on the PGA Tour and 27th time worldwide.""This is one of my favorite places in the world,"" said McIlroy, who picked up his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow in 2010. ""To break the drought and win here, it's awesome.''It was a tough finish for Mitchell, who started the final round with a two-shot lead and quickly stretched it to three shots with a 6-iron out of a fairway bunker into a stiffening breeze to 12 feet for birdie.But his short game let him down all day, leading to bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes that cost him the lead; and on the 14th hole and 15th holes, he had to settle for pars after being in position for birdies.Mitchell needed to finish alone in second to qualify for the PGA Championship through the money list. But he dropped a shot on the 17th and closed with a 72 to tie for third with Viktor Hovland, who had a 67.""Shows you how awesome he is as a player because he didn't have his best today and he still won, and that's why he's got majors and a bunch of wins,'' Mitchell said of McIlroy.Woodland had a share of the lead early on the back nine until he went through a bad patch of back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 12 and 13 and then settled for pars on the next two scoring holes. He shot 71 and finished fifth.McIlroy could have done without the drama on the 18th. With a two-shot lead, his drive went left of the winding stream into a deep hole of shaggy grass near the water. He started to try to gouge it out toward the fairway when Diamond stepped in to offer a few alternatives.They picked the right one: a penalty drop that limited any chaos, and McIlroy delivered a winner. His 2-foot par putt brought out one of the loudest cheers of a day filled with them. The Wells Fargo Championship had more energy than any tournament since golf returned from the pandemic.Just what McIlroy needed.He thought he would enjoy some quiet of no spectators. It didn't take long for him to realize he missed the energy.""To bring out the best in myself, I needed this,"" he said.And when it was over, McIlroy turned and heaved his golf ball toward the crowd. That felt good, too.","['lead', 'wells', 'hole', 'months', 'shot', 'final', 'championship', 'mcilroy', 'pga', 'stroke', 'won', 'victory', 'fargo', '18', 'rory', 'wins']",2021-05-09,espn.com,EUREX

He is the author of The Art of Currency Trading (Wiley, 2019) and his latest book, Alpha Trader, hits the shelves in Q2 2021.You can contact Brent at [email protected] and on Twitter at donnelly_brent.As with all of our guest contributors, Brent’s post may not represent the views of Epsilon Theory or Second Foundation Partners, and should not be construed as advice to purchase or sell any security.With the intense sturm und drang around inflation right now, expect the next six months to yield intense hand-wringing and chin scratching over CPI, PCE and … hedonic quality adjustment. Quite often when people go to Twitter to rail about CPI, they say something like “Man, my cost of living doesn’t look like that! My tuition and health care costs are skyrocketing!” Savvy statisticians then respond with a flurry of charts that look like the one at right and say “the plural of anecdote is not data” or something similar. So all those rising prices are being offset by all those falling prices and people are just noticing the prices that go up, right? Nope. The source of the data on that chart is the BLS, the U.S. organization charged with preparing the CPI data. The data has been sliced and diced like crazy. The CPI index is not a cost of living measure! It is a hedonically-adjusted basket of assumptions that attempts to track some sort of cost vs. quality / total-utility metric over time. So what exactly is hedonic quality adjustment? Let’s ask the BLS:Hedonic quality adjustment is one of the techniques the CPI uses to account for changing product quality within some CPI item samples. Hedonic quality adjustment refers to a method of adjusting prices whenever the characteristics of the products included in the CPI change due to innovation or the introduction of completely new products. The use of the word “hedonic” to describe this technique stems from the word’s Greek origin meaning “of or related to pleasure.” Economists approximate pleasure to the idea of utility – a measure of relative satisfaction from consumption of goods. In price index methodology, hedonic quality adjustment has come to mean the practice of decomposing an item into its constituent characteristics, obtaining estimates of the value of the utility derived from each characteristic, and using those value estimates to adjust prices when the quality of a good changes. The CPI obtains the value estimates used to adjust prices through the statistical technique known as regression analysis. Hedonic regression models are estimated to determine the value of the utility derived from each of the characteristics that jointly constitute an item.There is a significant degree of modelling and massaging going on. The BLS dances around the CPI as cost of living measure question here (see question  9) and the media often inaccurately describe CPI data as changes in cost of living. This leads to a situation where people see prices ripping higher and CPI at 2.0% and it makes them want to yell at CPI.Since I always think of TVs and cars as goods that have seen flat or falling prices over the years, I decided to have a quick peek at the real life vs. BLS-imagined price movements in the world of new vehicles. I made the arbitrary and grossly simplifying decision to use the Honda Accord and the Ford Mustang as my cars because they have been popular for more than 30 years, there is plenty of historical pricing data, and their target demographics and brand image haven’t changed much over time.Here is the Honda Accord, then and now:The 1990 vs. 2020 versions are clearly not the same car, especially when you compare airbags (or lack thereof), ABS, computer-assist, and all that stuff. The tricky thing for non-time-traveling humans, though, is that roughly the same socioeconomic cohort that bought Ford Mustangs or Honda Accords in 1990 is in line to buy those same cars in 2021. If you hedonically-adjust away the improvements, you are not talking about cost of living anymore, you are talking about quality-adjusted or utility-adjusted cost of living. And the result is a super-squishy approach that requires a litany of assumptions and leads to model output that is more a vague approximation of some utility-adjusted price, not an index that reflects actual real life changes in price.The next chart is one I created that shows the evolution of the BLS new vehicle price data (red) along with the average price of a Honda Accord and a Ford Mustang each year. Funny enough, the price of a car and the average hourly wage move up at about the same speed (probably not a coincidence!). That’s how Honda Accords and Ford Mustangs remain workhorse middle class cars for over 30 years. If the price was truly remaining flat as the BLS series implies, we’d all be driving BMWs (and eventually McLarens) as wages go higher in a fairly straight line and car prices remain unch.Did the price of cars go up, or stay flat since 1990? It’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer!Nominal prices of cars went up about 150%. Hedonically-adjusted car prices barely moved[1]. Real car prices (adjusted for wage growth) were flat. My brain is becoming a pretzel.And for good order this analysis is not sensitive to what kind of car you pick. All the lines look about the same, the only difference is the upward gradient of the slope, never the direction.And when it comes to new vehicles, here are some quality changes that might trigger a hedonic adjustment:If you’re curious, here is the BLS explainer for hedonic adjustment, which includes this fun stuff:If the item being modeled is men’s shirts, the independent variables might be sleeve length and fiber composition; a simplified version of a hedonic model for men’s shirts might be:Here all shirts are either short sleeve or long sleeve and either cotton/poly or 100% cotton. After doing the statistical processing BLS might estimate that ß1 = 0.15 and ß2 = 0.25. This indicates that a long sleeve shirt is 15 percent more valuable than a short sleeve one and that a 100% cotton shirt is 25 percent more valuable than a cotton/poly blend shirt. If the BLS data collector is forced to replace a short-sleeve cotton/poly shirt in the CPI sample with a long sleeve 100% cotton shirt, the CPI would adjust the price of the old item by the features in the new item, leading to a price adjustment of about 49 percent (e0.15+0.25).If the price of the original shirt had been $20 and that of the replacement shirt $30, rather than using a $10 increase in price for that sample observation, the CPI would adjust the original shirt for sleeves and cotton content resulting in a price estimate of $29.84 (20*e0.15+0.25). This adjustment attributes most of the price difference between the shirts to the change in characteristics and an increase of only $0.16 is shown.With 46% of the products in CPI hedonically adjusted, it’s hard to know what CPI is actually telling us. Here is a good description of the problem from the Praxis Advisory blog.While theoretically attractive, hedonic adjustment misses a key point. In all likelihood the good purchased was for the same or slightly higher price, regardless of quality (have Lexus cars dropped in price over the last 5 years?) Consider the following example. Say the only product that Americans purchase are M&M candies—100 M&Ms in a bag that costs $1.00. Each person is limited to one bag. Through the miracle of productivity, a way is found to fill each bag with 110 M&Ms that is now priced at $1.10. Hedonic adjustment would say that the bag really only costs $1.00 and that the CPI has not increased, since each M&M still costs a penny each. But the cost of the bag of M&Ms has gone up. And since each person must buy a bag, instead of an individual M&M, their cost of living has gone up by 10%. They must fork over an extra dime even though they’re getting more for their money. We can’t buy individual parts of a new car; we have to buy the whole car, complete with quality improvements. And the whole package costs more, improved or not. While hedonic adjustment may accurately reflect productivity increases, they don’t accurately reflect America’s cost to live. These adjustments accrue to businesses (which in turn don’t provide adequate raises) and the federal government (which in turn under-compensates Social Security recipients).Which is all fine and good. But we’re still left with this:A Honda Accord cost $12,000 in 1990 and it costs $25,000 now.A Mustang was $9,000 and now it’s $27,000.The BLS has new car prices close to unchanged over the past 30 years.Here’s the best my pretzel-brain can do to reconcile this. Here are my takeaways:People think CPI is a cost of living index, but it’s not. Stop comparing CPI to how your cost of living has changed.That said, the BLS does not push back very hard on the idea of CPI as a cost of living index!Even though CPI is not a cost of living index, CPI is still used for cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security and other benefits. CPI is also used to price TIPS.There is a point of abstraction at which the original object is no longer recognizable. It is possible that CPI is such an abstraction and this explains why it does not compute with the everyperson’s day-to-day experience. We are all staring at Salvador Dalí’s “Persistence of Memory” screaming “that’s not a clock!” It IS a clock. But it’s also not a clock.Prices for an item can go up or down and that item’s contribution to CPI can be in the same direction, the opposite direction or zero.Interestingly, hedonic adjustments only act as deflators. Say the airline crams another seat in your row, eliminates carry-on bags and otherwise makes your flight less happy and hedonic. Does the hedonically-adjusted price of your airfare increase? Nope.CPI is a model output dependent on a huge string of assumptions, not necessarily a true reflection of price changes for goods and services purchased by individual consumers.Just because you hear 14 scary inflation anecdotes tomorrow, don’t assume all or any of those price movements will impact CPI in the way that you expect. They might! Or they might not.This has been my best attempt to better understand the inner workings of CPI and why it looks and smells so different from reality. There is no easy answer to this conundrum as evidenced by this long discussion on the topic on the Social Security dot gov website, but I think this article from Bloomberg on the history of CPI sums it up pretty well:The first architects of price indexes appreciated the degree to which these numbers are nothing more than vague approximations that, precisely because they rest on such shaky foundations, can be put toward political ends.Sounds about right. Have a plaid and/or ludicrous day.[1] I am fairly sure hedonic-adjustment of new vehicle prices started in 1998 / 1999 but I couldn’t find the precise answer.Brent Donnelly is a senior risk-taker and FX market maker at HSBC New York and has been trading foreign exchange since 1995.

That was the difference.“Shows you how awesome he is as a player,” Mitchell said, “because he didn't have his best today and he still won and that's why he's got majors and a bunch of wins. It's impressive watching that because he had to fight there today, too. The wind was gusting like crazy.”It marked McIlroy’s 19th PGA TOUR victory, and his third at the Wells Fargo (2010, ’15, ’21). This also marks the first time he’s won a tournament three times, which he called “pretty cool,” and yet that seemed relatively unimportant next to the fact that he was winning at all.It had been 553 days since McIlroy won the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions. He came into the Wells Fargo at 15th in the Official World Golf Ranking, the lowest he’s been since late 2009, and 51st in the FedExCup. Some of his problems, he admitted, were self-inflicted.He was rolling along nicely prior to the pandemic, but when the TOUR returned without fans on site last June, McIlroy had trouble summoning the requisite oomph for world-class golf. He and wife Erica had a daughter, Poppy, their first child, unquestionably the highlight of the year.His forgettable golf got worse this season after Bryson DeChambeau bashed his way to victory at the U.S. Open and McIlroy decided to try and increase his swing speed. In so doing he lost his swing. After a final-round 76 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard (T10, eight behind DeChambeau) in March, he said he was “dejected” and “maybe looking to go in a different direction.”Soon he was working with Pete Cowen, and it was the first time he’s listed someone other than Michael Bannon as his primary coach. He said it was for the long-term good of his career, and the swing changes might take, “a bit of time.” He missed cuts at THE PLAYERS Championship and the Masters, took a vacation to the Bahamas, came home, kept grinding.Quail Hollow, though, is McIlroy’s happy place. In 10 starts at the Wells Fargo he now has eight top-10 finishes, including three wins. He shot a course-record 62 to win going away in 2010 and broke his own record with a 61 in his 2015 victory. He seems to win here every five years whether he needs it or not. (There was no tournament in 2020 or he surely would have won it.)With the victory, he has now won on Father’s and Mother’s Day, and there, just off the 18th green and in a floppy sun hat, was wife Erica cradling Poppy. He bent down to give them a celebratory kiss, the scene further underlining that this was a changed McIlroy. This was his first win as a dad, and his first with new coach Cowen. He’s been working with sports psychologist Bob Rotella for the last few months. And living through the pandemic has changed us all.","['wells', 'came', 'swing', 'hes', 'championship', 'won', 'golf', 'victory', 'fargo', 'win', 'mcilroy', 'hangs', 'rory']",2021-05-10,pgatour.com,EUREX

HSBC,1,PyNews API,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-companies-breakingview-idUSKBN2CR1JH,Breakdown: Net zero goals demand zero tolerance - Reuters,"Oxford University researchers found only a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies by sales have a net zero target.Many heavy polluters like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) lack net zero targets and full disclosure of their emissions.Big banks that lend to carbon-intensive industries have been similarly slow to elaborate on net zero aspirations.Yet Oxford researchers reckon only a third of corporate net zero targets cover all three.- The new group – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – will bring existing net zero initiatives together under one umbrella to help ensure all sub-sector efforts are consistent and ambitious.","The Wahlenberg Glacier is seen in Oscar II land at Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway, August 5, 2019.What do Microsoft (MSFT.O), British Airways, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), and Glencore (GLEN.L) have in common? They all reckon their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will hit “net zero” by 2050. Though the targets sound the same, investors shouldn’t assume they are. Breakingviews offers a way to sort substance from hot air.WHAT EXACTLY IS NET ZERO?To limit the increase in the planet’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world needs to stop pumping new GHGs into the atmosphere by 2050 at the latest. That means eliminating 50 billion tonnes of annual emissions from the atmosphere. The “net” part of this target reflects its difficulty: many industries lack low-carbon alternatives. The Network for Greening the Financial System, a grouping of central banks, reckons heavy emitters could still produce 13 billion tonnes of GHGs annually by 2050. Cancelling these out means planting more trees to absorb the carbon dioxide or developing ways to remove gases from the air.HOW ALIGNED ARE COMPANIES WITH NET ZERO?Not very. Oxford University researchers found only a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies by sales have a net zero target. A separate report by the NewClimate Institute said that as of October 2020, companies with net zero objectives represented only 3.5 billion tonnes of GHGs a year. By comparison, a 2017 study by environmental charity CDP estimated the top 224 corporate emitters accounted for 30 billion tonnes annually.Many heavy polluters like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) lack net zero targets and full disclosure of their emissions. Big banks that lend to carbon-intensive industries have been similarly slow to elaborate on net zero aspirations.WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SET TARGETS?They’re a mixed bag. Microsoft wants to develop technology to remove not only its current GHG output but to erase all emissions since the $2 trillion software group was founded in 1975. That’s laudable, but even today its annual emissions are less than 20 million tonnes. British Airways parent International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) produces 40 million tonnes, miner Glencore 300 million tonnes, and Shell 600 million tonnes – more than the United Kingdom.Many net zero targets have three shortcomings: incomplete disclosure, confusing terminology, and problems with offsets.WHAT’S THE PROBLEM WITH DISCLOSURE?Companies serious about net zero targets should include not just so-called Scope 1 and 2 emissions, produced when they make their products, but also Scope 3, created when customers use those products. Think power stations burning Glencore’s coal, or cars fuelled by Shell’s petrol. Yet Oxford researchers reckon only a third of corporate net zero targets cover all three.Large oil companies, for whom Scope 3 often constitutes 90% of total emissions, have recently improved their disclosure. But it’s still frustratingly piecemeal. Shell’s net zero target covers all three scopes worldwide. BP’s (BP.L) is similar but leaves out its 20% stake in Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), which accounts for a third of the UK group’s oil production. Total’s (TOTF.PA) net zero target only includes European Scope 3 emissions.WHAT ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY?A company claiming to be “carbon neutral” might sound the same as net zero. In fact, carbon dioxide accounts for only 75% of overall GHGs. Oil giants can use this loophole to ignore worse pollutants like methane.Meanwhile companies that embrace “Paris-aligned” targets are craftily exploiting the fact that the 2015 accord signed in the French capital called for limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. That’s less demanding than the tougher limit of 1.5 degrees. JPMorgan (JPM.N) says it aligns the most polluting sectors it lends to with “the goals of Paris”, but the U.S. bank doesn’t have a company-level commitment to hit net zero by 2050.WHAT’S WRONG WITH OFFSETS?Many companies intend to hit their targets by offsetting emissions. This involves buying credits in carbon-cutting ventures elsewhere. Offsets are integral to Shell, Glencore and IAG’s plans. The hope is that sellers of such credits use the money to plant new forests or develop technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere.The danger is that companies just use flakier offsets to slow down actual reductions in emissions. Even leaving aside fraudulent ones, it’s hard to prove how much offset schemes reduce GHGs. They often base their emissions-cutting credentials on counterfactuals: preserving a forest that would otherwise be pulled down, for example.Besides, it’s hard to guarantee offsets will work on the scale required. Shell’s net zero assumptions imply planting new trees across an area the size of Brazil. Total calls its shipments of liquefied natural gas to China “carbon neutral” because the French group is providing financing for a Chinese wind power project and a Zimbabwean forest protection scheme.Only 33 of the 417 companies with net zero targets don’t plan to use offsets, Oxford researchers found. Just under two-thirds either gave no detail or said they would use them liberally.WOULD BANNING OFFSETS MAKE NET ZERO TARGETS MORE CREDIBLE?Yes. But unless governments want to pay for tree-planting and carbon removal technology, there’s a role for private finance. One option is voluntary carbon markets, where companies that reduce or eliminate GHGs sell credits. Ex-Bank of England Governor Mark Carney reckons credits worth 100 million tonnes a year currently could become 1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, with checks and balances to ensure their credibility.A more radical alternative would be to bin net zero goals altogether. Instead of stimulating dubious offsets to meet otherwise-unattainable targets, the World Wildlife Fund and Boston Consulting Group suggest companies disclose their emissions, estimate how much they can credibly reduce them, and pledge funding for research into permanent GHG removal.SO DO NET ZERO GOALS HAVE ANY VALUE?Despite the brickbats, they are useful for focusing minds. But they need a better-regulated offset market, full disclosure of emissions and consensus about what the goal means. In the continuing absence of all three, investors should treat each bold target with scepticism.Follow gfhay on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on April 21 announced a new plan to boost efforts by the financial system to help move the global economy to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.- The new group – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – will bring existing net zero initiatives together under one umbrella to help ensure all sub-sector efforts are consistent and ambitious. So far, more than 160 firms with assets of at least $70 trillion have signed up, of which 43 are banks. Members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance include Barclays, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Bank of America and Citi.- All members will need to set climate plans in line with the U.N.’s Race to Zero campaign, which ensures they are science-based, cover all types of emissions, have 2030 interim targets and commit to transparent reporting and accounting.- The banks joining GFANZ will need to set an interim target of 2030 or sooner within 18 months that focuses on those parts of their financing business responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions.","['tonnes', 'emissions', 'net', 'carbon', 'ghgs', 'tolerance', 'targets', 'companies', 'demand', 'goals', 'zero', 'target', 'offsets', 'breakdown']",2021-05-10,reuters.com,EUREX

Morgan Private Bank(Left to right, top to bottom:) Brian Swenson, Eric Smith, Jesse Bohannon, Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter moved to Morgan Stanley from J.P. Morgan Private Bank.The group is led by advisors Brian R. Swenson, Eric T. Smith, and Jesse F. Bohannon and also includes support staff Melissa Sende and Charlotte Painter. They had overseen $2.8 billion in customer assets, and have joined Morgan Stanley’s private wealth management business after a 90-day garden leave, the source confirmed.Swenson, who spent his career at J.P. Morgan since he first registered there in 2006, according to BrokerCheck, did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. He officially joined Morgan Stanley on May 3, according to the database, although Smith and Bohannon registered with the wirehouse in March and January, respectively.Swenson had been a managing director at J.P. Morgan, a corporate title that a source at the firm said previously carries a 90-day garden leave, while others moving with him were likely obligated to wait only 60 days or fewer before joining their new firm.Swenson had also been head of the private banking business in Utah and Idaho, according to LinkedIn, which shows he started as an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Denver after graduating in 2003 from Brigham Young University.Smith, who was an executive director, started his career at J.P. Morgan in 2011. Bohannon spent a rookie year at Jefferies in 2015 and worked at Morgan Stanley between 2016 and 2018 before joining J.P. Morgan, according to BrokerCheck.A J.P. Morgan spokesperson confirmed the departure but declined to comment on client assets or production figures.J.P. Morgan in March tapped private banker Kristin Schaefer to replace Swenson as market lead in the two states, according to an internal memo sent March 9. Schaefer had been with J.P. Morgan since 2020, when she left Wells Fargo & Co.’s Private Bank.She had also worked as a global banking consultant at Wells Fargo in Palo Alto, California, before moving to Utah in 2016, according to the memo, and reports to Geoff Barker, J.P. Morgan Private Bank Market Manager for the Rockies Region.“Her depth of experience, the global power of J.P. Morgan and local expertise of the Private Bank team will deepen our commitment to the region and offer a wealth management platform not seen before in this market,” Barker said in the memo.Swenson’s team follows a path of large salaried banking teams who have been joining traditional brokerage firms with increasing frequency over the past year. Recruiters have said wirehouses have turned a fresh eye to those teams, which they had historically not targeted given the garden-leave policies and customer bank ties that can make transferring assets difficult.UBS Wealth Management USA last week recruited what several sources said was one of the largest teams at J.P. Morgan, a Dallas group led by Cindy Brown who generated $75 million in revenue from $25 billion in assets. It also hired a $2 billion-AUM team from Bank of America’s private bank in California.Merrill Lynch last month recruited a Citibank private banker in San Francisco who reportedly oversaw $17 billion in client assets.Morgan Stanley has been aggressively recruiting large broker teams across the industry since it restarted its recruiting engine last year after pulling out in 2017 of the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, the industry recruiting and client solicitation pact. Morgan Stanley no longer breaks out specific headcount, which a spokesperson said last month is around 16,000, including several hundred call-center based brokers.J.P.

Investors looked to leverage as much of that momentum as they could by moving away from pricey so-called growth stocks, such as big technology companies, toward what are known as value stocks, which are more closely linked to the underlying economy, such as the infrastructure and banking sectors.The European region is more heavily exposed to those sectors that benefit from economic recovery, such as industrials, retail, and transport, while the US market has more exposure to tech stocks, many of which were considered COVID-19 stay-at-home winners.Yet even with the recovery fully gaining traction in developed markets, Europe's relative flows remain at the low end of historical ranges compared with the record inflows that global equities have seen in the past three months, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.In a report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analysts said global investors should consider the European region.The Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Garman said Europe had outperformed MSCI's All Country World Index since February ""yet there is little evidence of love for the region in a global context.""Relative valuations are close to 10-year lows, and even when adjusted by sector Europe still looks cheap relative to MSCI's All Country World Index, a leading global index, Garman said.European equities have matched the performance of US blue-chip stocks so far this year. The STOXX 600 — an index of major European shares — is up about 11% in 2021, the same as the S&P 500.Morgan Stanley said rising government-bond yields were driving a better period for European equities. Over the past 12 months, however, European shares have lagged their US peers. The STOXX 600 has gained about 30%, while the S&P 500 has risen by over 40% to record highs this month.This could soon come to a halt, however.Morgan Stanley's US economists are predicting the Federal Reserve might start discussing slowing the pace of its asset purchases, or quantitative easing, when it meets in June, a tool it used to support the economy.Many analysts believe quantitative easing has inflated asset prices and that tapering, in turn, could create a slowdown in the stock market.""Assuming longer-term growth outlook remains favorable, such a period should represent a temporary pause/reset in a bull market rather than anything more extreme — over the long run, equity markets generally track underlying EPS trends,"" Garman said.Despite the potential pause to the bull-market rally in the US, the analysts expect Europe's economic momentum to further boost European equity performance over the summer.The analysts also emphasize that investors should worry less about the region's sectoral mix compared with previous years.""In each of the last 10 years, Europe's sector composition has acted as a drag, with the lack of tech the biggest contributor to this,"" Garman said.The mix is now changing. Technology is now the biggest sector within the STOXX 50, an index of the 50 largest eurozone stocks.""This ongoing change implies higher and less volatile trend EPS growth going forward, and should also make it easier for global investors looking for exposure to structural growth to engage with European equities,"" Garman said.A graph of technology's share of European initial public offerings from Morgan Stanley's Wednesday research note.

The British company, the world's biggest caterer, is seeing improving demand in the United States, its largest market, analysts said, after a tepid fiscal first half ended March. Global companies in the past two weeks, including Exxon and Under Armour have reported improvements in their businesses, and a measure of U.S. services industry activity has surged recently, indicating improving demand from U.S. customers. Compass, which serves staff at firms including Microsoft Corp and Chevron Corp, as well as school kids and healthcare workers, will publish on Wednesday results for its fiscal first half. Investors will watch for commentary on the second half, looking for signs that efforts to cut costs and renegotiate contracts are bearing fruit.

The company, which employs more than 550,000 people across 45 countries, had forecast a 3.4% profit margin for the six months to March, down from 6.7% a year earlier. Before the pandemic, it recorded an annual margin of more than 7%. ""It is difficult to accurately predict the recovery curve ahead for caterers, but we would draw some comfort from trends in key lead indicators, especially from the U.S.,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said. Compass gained market share in the United States last year, cornering about 22% of the total contract catering market, Morgan Stanley analyst Jamie Rollo said. It outperformed rivals Sodexo and Aramark in the healthcare space, thanks to new business wins, he added. Profit margin growth will ease, however, in the fiscal fourth quarter as the company reopens its canteens to keep up with demand, pushing up raw material and hiring costs, Rollo said.

Any views expressed here are his own)LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Global investors have flipped from ‘buy everything’ to ‘peak everything’ in a matter of weeks - but these manic mood swings may even out soon.Stock markets appear to have run into the sand after several weeks of torrential inflows. By Bank of America’s reckoning the influx into world equity funds over the past five months exceeded that of the past 12 years combined.Fears of ‘too much, too soon’ prompted many investment firms - including Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan - to warn in recent weeks of a possible 5-10% correction ahead.This week’s tech-led shakeout - the second such wobble in less than 3 months - reinforced a whole host of those anxieties - everything from ‘peak’ business sentiment, earnings and output growth to ‘peak’ central bank largesse, excess liquidity and investment flows.The unfolding surge in economic activity as economies reopen may endure for another year or more. But annual or annualised rates of change may be cresting while related commodity price rebounds, supply bottlenecks and annual base effects keep hands wringing that ‘peak’ inflation is yet to come - whether tolerated by central banks or not.Unlike February’s sharp intake of breath, this week’s equity market gasp had little to do with rising interest rates or long-term borrowing costs per se. Implied yields on one of the widest measures of public and private sector bonds worldwide - the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse - has barely budged for 2 months.And yet Morgan Stanley - a long-standing and accurate predictor a V-shaped equity market bounce since the pandemic shock last March - now posits that we’re already in a ‘mid-cycle transition’ where ‘flattish’ returns for 2021 as a whole are to be expected, with a 10-20% correction along the way.Citing corporate margin pressures from the sort of commodity and wage input price pressures nagging stock traders all month, it reckons now’s the time to get more defensive. “It’s often better to travel than arrive from an investment perspective.”History supports that. Deutsche last month flagged that Wall Street’s S&P500 benchmark has dropped by a median 8.3% following 37 peaks in the U.S. Institute of Supply Management’s (ISM) business sentiment index since World War Two.The retreat in ISM manufacturing and service sector indices for April - from 37-year and record highs respectively in March - most likely unnerved investors that the top of that cycle may now be in.And perhaps unsurprisingly, hedge funds - according to Bank of America - leaned heavily into the most recent record highs with registered net sales at a record over a 12-year dataset.Beyond the States, JPMorgan’s April global business survey indices hit a 14-year high. It said that was consistent with ‘boomy’ 4% annualised world output growth - an expansion that it still forecasts will hit 6% for the second quarter as a whole, with input and output prices growth at its fastest in 12 years.CHEAPENINGSo, is that it? Has the great stock market ‘discounting mechanism’ - as Morgan Stanley describes it - already discounted the entire post-pandemic recovery?Prior to this week MSCI’s all-country stock index had risen almost 90% from the March nadir last year - some 22% above pre-pandemic highs.But not everyone’s convinced of peak markets just yet.David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management points out that angst about historically expensive stock valuations may be overstated as earnings forecasts have clearly been underclubbed and even UBS’ own call of 31% profit growth for S&P500 firms for 2021 may now be ‘too conservative’.Lefkowitz, UBS equities chief for the Americas, said first quarter profit growth is running about 24% ahead of consensus forecasts and estimates for the next 12 months have been revised up by 16% since the start of the year - more than the 13% rise in stock prices to new records last week.Remarkably, that means 12-month forward Price/Earnings ratios have fallen this year both for the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq - and indeed for European benchmarks - despite the appearance of runaway markets and an investor scramble.“Strong revenue growth is overwhelming the cost trends,” Lefkowitz said in a blog, adding he retained a year-end 4,400 forecast for the S&P500 - now 7% higher than current levels.And then there’s the return of stock buybacks. Precautionary cash held by many firms during the pandemic is being freed up again, with buybacks tending to come in advance of a rebound in dividend payouts and year-to-date U.S. buybacks of some $300 billion already more than twice a year ago.Neuberger Berman’s multi-asset chief investment officer Erik Knutzen feels the pause will be temporary. “There will be higher market peaks to climb.”","['columnpeaky', 'market', 'durable', 'investment', 'mike', 'dolan', 'weeks', 'sp500', 'bank', 'growth', 'peak', 'stock', 'markets', '12', 'look']",2021-05-12,reuters.com,EUREX

At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

The Bank of Canada's C$1 billion ($806 million) cut to its weekly bond-buying programme last month highlights the next phase is about slowing hefty asset purchases.Bank of America estimates central bank asset purchases in the United States, Japan, the euro zone and Britain will slide to about $3.4 trillion this year from almost $9 trillion in 2020. For 2022, it predicts purchases of just $400 billion.Here's a look at who is tapering, who may raise interest rates and who might be the last to call time on pandemic-era monetary stimulus.1/ NORWAYNorges Bank is at the vanguard in terms of signalling a retreat, and said on Thursday it is on track to hike interest rates in the second half of 2021.That has made the crown this year's best performing G10 currency. The central bank doesn't intervene in bond markets, so the taper debate is not applicable.2/ CANADAHaving announced tapering, Canada has signalled that its key interest rate could rise from 0.25% late in 2022.3/ BRITAINFlagging a stronger economic rebound, the BoE will slow bond-buying to 3.4 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) a week, from the 4.4 billion-pound current weekly pace.However, it kept the total size of the bond-buying programme unchanged at 895 billion pounds and Governor Andrew Bailey said the move did not amount to tapering.""Since the Bank has already purchased 70 billion pounds out of the 150 billion pounds in gilts to be purchased by the end of 2021, purchases were already set to naturally slow,"" Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said.Story continuesFor a graphic on British bond markets stable as BoE slows weekly bond buys: UNITED STATESThe Fed plans to keep borrowing costs near 0% and maintain monthly asset purchases worth $120 billion until it sees ""substantial further progress"" towards full employment and its 2% flexible inflation target.But with the economy expected to grow by more than 6% this year and inflation to be a ""little higher"" - according to Fed boss Jerome Powell - markets are pricing in a rate rise in 2023. Many analysts expect tapering to start this year.The Fed faces a delicate balancing act, ensuring that tapering at a time of massive U.S. government borrowing does not boost Treasury yields too much.Pictet Wealth senior economist Thomas Costerg expects tapering to start by early 2022 and proceed at a monthly pace of $10 billion. That process would last about a year - ""enough to keep expectations for the first rate hike well in the distance"", he added.For a graphic on Central bank holdings of government bonds: SWEDENSwedish inflation is approaching the Riksbank's 2% target but it has said interest rates would stay at 0% for years. However, its 700 billion crowns ($84 billion) asset purchase programme will wind down this year as planned.6/ EURO ZONEAnaemic long-term inflationary pressures mean euro area rates are unlikely to rise for years. But tapering may come sooner, especially within the European Central Bank's 1.85 trillion euro ($2.2 trillion) pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).Technically, this runs until March 2022 but some officials are already advocating reducing bond purchases as growth rebounds.Danske Bank analysts reckon the ECB will end up using only 1.65 trillion euros of the total PEPP stimulus package.For a graphic on ECB weekly PEPP purchases: AUSTRALIAAustralia's economic rebound has surpassed expectations but the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has underscored its dovish credentials by adopting yield curve control, could be among the last to tighten policy.It wants unemployment slashed and inflation within its 2% to 3% target before shifting tack, and doesn't see either happening until 2024. Economists expect rates to stay on hold until then.The RBA's A$100 billion ($77.45 billion) QE programme ends in September and it will consider in July whether to extend it.8/ NEW ZEALANDNew Zealand's strong recovery and red-hot property markets have raised speculation a rate rise may come sooner than expected.While its key interest rate is expected to stay at 0.25% this year, some analysts predict a rise in the second half of 2022. The central bank meanwhile appears to be in no hurry to taper its NZ$100 billion ($72 billion) QE programme.9/ JAPANThe BOJ pledged last week to maintain stimulus using yield target control and via bonds and equity purchases.It has been accused of ""stealth tapering"" because its bond-buying has slowed since yield curve control (YCC) was adopted in 2016, though purchases have picked up slightly in the past year.In March, they were about 22.2 trillion yen ($204 billion)above levels a year ago. But that's still a quarter of the 81.96 trillion yen year-on-year increase in August 2016, just before YCC came in.For a graphic on BOJ steadily ‘stealth’ tapering its JGB buying:-CENTRALBANKS/TAPER/bdwpkbmllvm/chart.png10/ SWITZERLANDThe Swiss National Bank does not intervene in domestic bond markets, instead capping the Swiss franc through interventions which came to nearly 110 billion francs ($120 billion) in 2020.

To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead.

The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April.

I am a mom. I am a cis gender Millennial who’s been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. . . I am intersectional. But my existence is not a box checking exercise.”Wait, what? If your existence isn’t about box checking, why did you literally just check off all the boxes in which you identify? Racial identity: check. Gender identity: check. Disability: check.The video goes on to showcase all the diversity and inclusion awards that the officer won during her time at the CIA. And she continues:“At 36, I refuse to internalize misguided patriarchal ideas of what a woman can or should be.”There you have it— the CIA’s new mission is not gathering and analyzing intelligence to defend the nation. It’s fighting back against the patriarchy.America’s enemies are shaking in their boots.Click here to watch the video.DC mayor bans dancing at weddingsThe Mayor of Washington DC has issued a health order which demands wedding guests stay seated at wedding receptions.The order specifically notes that at weddings, “Attendees and guests must remain seated and socially distanced from each other and other household groups… Standing and dancing receptions are not allowed.”Standing… is now illegal.The real irony here is that Washington DC is one of the MOST VACCINATED cities in the US, with 631,000 vaccine doses administered out of an adult population (according to census data) of 577,000.Click here to read the full order.Five years in prison for returning to Australia from IndiaThe Australian health department has banned travelers from entering Australia within 14 days of having been in India.The government says this order falls under the authority of the Biosecurity Act.This applies to Australian citizens as well, who could incur a fine of up to $66,600 and 5 years in prison for boarding a flight home.When asked about this insanity, the Prime Minister said, “I think the likelihood of any of that occurring is pretty much zero.”I guess that makes it OK. Of course, the likelihood would be exactly zero if his government hadn’t issued the ridiculous order to begin with.Click here to read the order .American Families Plan will allow IRS to monitor your bank accountA US Treasury Department fact sheet called Investing in the IRS and Improving Tax Compliance, explains the new powers the IRS would have under Biden’s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan:“This reform aims to provide the IRS information on account flows so that it has a lens into investment and business activity… it leverages the information that financial institutions already know about account holders, simply requiring that they add to their regular, annual reports information about aggregate account outflows and inflows.”In other words, the government already requires that banks spy on their customers, and report to the IRS.But now the banks would be forced to tell the IRS how much money came into each account, and how much left.They say this will help the IRS choose who to audit, since they will know if the money in their bank accounts matches what they disclosed on their tax filings.The government will assume you are a tax evader until you prove your innocence.Click here to read the Treasury fact sheet.Caitlyn Jenner opposes transgender athletes in women’s sportsThe most famous transgender person alive is against allowing transgender people to compete in women’s sports.When asked about the issue, Caitlyn Jenner said, “This is a question of fairness. That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair. And we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools.”This is even more interesting given that Jenner won a gold medal in the Olympic decathlon— as a biological male competing in male sports.So is Caitlyn Jenner transphobic for acknowledging biological facts?Click here to read the full story.Danish bank lowers threshold for charging negative interestThe central bank of Denmark charges Danish banks negative interest rates on their deposits.That means instead of earning interest for keeping money with the central bank, they have to pay to deposit money.Until recently, most banks absorbed the cost of this negative interest rather than passing it along to customers with small deposits.Now Danske Bank has announced it is lowering the threshold at which it will begin charging customers negative interest on their deposit accounts.Danske Bank has cut the threshold from 250,000 to 100,000 krone— from about $40,000 USD to $16,000 USD.Customers with more than $16,000 in combined deposits across all bank accounts will now be charged negative .6%— which would be $120 per year on a $20,000 balance.For customers with certain types of accounts, the threshold has been lowered to 0 krone. They will be charged no matter how little money they keep in the bank.Click here to read the statement.Court says $30,000 fines for tall grass are not excessiveA Florida town fined a man $500 per day for having tall grass in his yard.At the time, he was away tending to his recently deceased mother’s estate. By the time he came back to town, the fines had accrued to $30,000.And instead of negotiate with the man, the city opted to foreclose on his home to collect the fines.Obviously the man sued, in what should have been a clear case of excessive fines.But last week, a federal judge decided that $30,000 fines for tall grass do not violate the Constitution’s protection against excessive punishment .The fact that the city failed to notify the man until after the fines accrued, and then foreclosed on his home to collect, was also not excessive.Click here to read the full story.* * *On another note… We think gold could DOUBLE and silver could increase by up to 5 TIMES in the next few years.

But O’Sullivan’s timing was more pragmatic.“I was still teaching then and I’d finish school in Limerick at 12 o’clock on a Friday and bang up the road to Mayo, which was almost a three-hour drive back then,” says O’Sullivan, the founder and owner of Zeus Packaging. “Friday afternoon was the only time I could meet the procurement manager.“When I got Baxter Healthcare in year one of the business, it was a massive win for me. We still supply Baxter Healthcare in Mayo today with stretch film for all their business out of Irish plants.”Since starting Zeus out of his car as a reluctant teacher, the 51-year-old has transformed it into one of Europe’s largest privately-owned packaging companies. Zeus — a name inspired by a fellow passenger on a business trip rather than the Greek god —now employs 600 people in 26 countries, with operations in the UK, China, Spain, Germany, Poland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The company makes and supplies 9,000 different stock items to industries ranging from grocery and hospitality to food processing, pharma and agriculture. Zeus’s industrial division sells pallet wrapping and cardboard boxes, while its hygiene business sells cleaning supplies to factories, offices, supermarkets, manufacturers, restaurants and hotels.It also supplies packaging for takeaway meals and items such as coffee cups, stirrers, lids and bags to supermarkets such as Dunnes Stores and is the world’s No. 1 producer of twine and bale net.The company turned over €210m in 2020, thanks to organic growth and a string of acquisitions. Last Monday, Zeus completed its acquisition of Petruzalek, an Austrian-based food packaging business. The €20m-purchase, which was announced in February, strengthens the Dublin-based company’s geographic reach in 12 European countries. In 2020, Petruzalek generated revenue of about €58m.The deal was the last and largest purchase in Zeus’s three-year €40m acquisition strategy and was the seventh business to be embedded in the group in the past two years.It puts Zeus on track to become the largest independent packaging distribution business in Europe.O’Sullivan says: “Our five-year plan is to take the business to half a billion euro and that, by any stretch of the imagination, is significant for an Irish company.”Growing up in Britway, a farming community about 14km from the east Cork town of Fermoy, O’Sullivan always wanted to make money and “not be poor”. The O’Sullivans were non-farmers living in an agricultural heartland; his father drove a forklift for the Dairygold co-op and his mother looked after the family’s three children. The entrepreneur worked the entire way through his education, from primary school right through to his eventual master’s degree.He milked cows and rode out horses for local farmers, picked stones from fields for a pound a day, emulated his father by driving a forklift at Dairygold, and drew silage for an agricultural contractor.“I would see the farmers’ sons who had no interest in having a farm and I would have given anything to be them because I loved it so much,” O’Sullivan says. “I have plenty of chips on my shoulders and I fully believe I am where I am now because of my drive.”He attended the local Tech in Fermoy, but the vocational school didn’t offer any honours’ subjects. A teacher encouraged O’Sullivan to pursue four honours’ subjects on his own and even filled out the CAO form for him.“He said to me, ‘I know you have a chance of getting out and not hanging around town. You’re good at this stuff and you can do it’,” O’Sullivan says. “I got a course at Thomond College (now part of UL) to become a metalwork and engineering teacher, even though I had no interest it. I just wanted to work and to better myself.”After finishing the Leaving Cert at the age of 16, O’Sullivan had two options: accept his mother’s advice to work full-time as a farming contractor for 140 punts (€178) a week — “huge money at the time” — or become the first in his small Leaving Cert year to go to college.“Zero disrespect to my mom but I went to Limerick. It was supposed to be a stepping stone; I didn’t want to be a metalwork teacher.”While doing a master’s degree in engineering technology, O’Sullivan was working three other jobs, selling mobile phones, lecturing at Thomond College and even had a nixer as an electrician. He entered the packaging industry while he was teaching by working with a man who sold agricultural crop packaging. This eventually led to O’Sullivan giving up his teaching career to start his own business selling pallet wrapping in 1998.In 2002, when Zeus was generating annual revenues of €4m, mostly from transit packaging and industrial packaging for the likes of Dell, the introduction of a tax on plastic carrier bags spelled trouble for companies that over-relied on supplying them. O’Sullivan’s first-ever acquisition was a Dublin-based supplier of carrier bags to Spar and BWG in the capital.With a new-found taste for acquisitions, O’Sullivan went on to make four more. He borrowed extensively to build up the business this way until Zeus had achieved a turnover of €80m. Then the recession hit.“We were swimming out of our depth — big-time,” he says.“I had bought my last company in early 2008.“Nowadays, when we’re buying a business, we use all these parameters such as Ebitda and multiples. But I didn’t know what that meant back then — I had never had a business lecture in my life because I had learned everything on the hoof. Danske Bank sent over a guy from Copenhagen to me who said ‘your Ebitda is this and your gearing is minus this’.""I turned to him and said, ‘what is Ebitda?’ He said, ‘you owe us €50m and you don’t know what Ebitda is?’“The bank could have taken the business from me if they felt there was something they could do with it. But we were in such a bad position there was nothing they could do with it,” O’Sullivan says.Once business was back on track, he returned his attention to expansion. In 2019, Zeus embarked on a €40m-investment programme, buying an Irish hygiene supplies company called Essential Supplies, followed by manufacturer Aldar Tissues.UK Investments included Liverpool-based distribution business Smith Bateson, Lincolnshire-based food packaging business Van der Windt, and Saffron Waldon-based VaioPak.But by early 2020, Zeus was facing its second existential threat in a decade, as Covid-19 spread from China to Europe.“I probably had a fair bit of insight into how bad this was going to be because I was speaking to China every morning,” O’Sullivan says.When Ireland imposed a lockdown in March 2020, “I spent three weeks at our Rathcoole office without going home to make some very tough decisions very quickly.“Fantastic customers of mine were closed. My supply was coming in from Asia and I had it all paid for. We have 2.5m sq ft of warehouse space so imagine that getting overfull and customers saying ‘we don’t need it — we’re closed’.“At the moment, the whole supply chain is an absolute mess. In an ironic way, the Suez Canal (closure) was the best thing that happened to us because people saw this for real on RTÉ news. The price of container shipping has quadrupled in 12 months and everything is out of kilter. It’s going to take six to 12 months for the supply chain to sort itself out.”It was bedding down acquisitions, coupled with winning new contracts, that helped Zeus shore up revenue last year, when turnover increased 13.5pc to €210m, albeit lower than the original target of €230m.O’Sullivan expects Zeus to post revenue of €275m in 2021.While home deliveries and the food takeaway sector boosted demand for packaging, they couldn’t compensate for the closure of offices right across Zeus’s markets.“If you look at all the offices in Dublin, for instance, all those people who went in there every day before Covid spent money on food and the facility management companies we supply bought cleaning products and toilet paper,” he says. “You are never going to make up for the movement of people; in my business, people moving and going places equates to revenue.”O’Sullivan is also making moves of his own: over the last 18 months, he’s been stepping back from the day-to-day operations of Zeus. He has created a board structure, with Keith Ockenden at the helm as CEO. O’Sullivan now focuses on strategy, investment and innovation.He is especially keen to expand Zeus’s sustainability offering — the company has been selling fully compostable cups for 15 years and is about to launch a sustainable fibre lid to McDonald’s outlets.“While I completely intend to be around and be in my business, it would be desperately remiss of me if I didn’t put in the structures so that the business can survive if I wasn’t around tomorrow,” he says.Reflecting on the hard graft he put in since childhood to achieve his goals, the Corkman wonders whether future generations of entrepreneurs will have the same drive as him.“Kids nowadays — my kids included — have it so easy and I don’t know how that drive will be in them, even though I will do my level best to try and keep them grounded. When you already have all the stuff you want, how can you drive on for more stuff?”Expand Close CEO and owner of Zeus, Brian O’Sullivan.

While the budget deficit in the 12 months through June 2022 is wider than expected at 5% of GDP, it leaves the opposition Labor party struggling for a narrative when the conservative incumbent is spending so freely.“The budget continues the transition from crisis support to growth recovery,” said Chris Nicol, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in Melbourne. The program has “kept policy leadership in the fiscal court whilst signaling from the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to be one of patience -- both aiming for a ‘hot’ economy with stronger jobs, wages and inflation.”Frydenberg is joining international peers such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in ramping up spending to push the economy toward maximum employment. His program is being buttressed by the RBA’s record-low interest rates, yield target and bond-buying program that aim to break a prolonged run of weak inflation.The government is spending big on infrastructure, aged care and tax breaks for households and businesses. But it has given itself some wriggle room for later upgrades to the budget position by taking very conservative iron ore and jobless rate forecasts.Iron Ore, JobsTreasury estimates iron ore will fall back to $55 a ton by the end of March 2022, from more than $200 a ton at present. It also sees 4.75% unemployment in June 2023, a quarter percentage point higher than the RBA’s latest estimate.Finance Minister Simon Birmingham defended the forecasts in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.“People would accuse us of cooking the books if we were to make more ambitious assumptions,” he said. “We’ve maintained the conservative posture that is important to making sure that we actually have a budget that people can have faith in.”The budget acknowledged “upside risks” for commodities as industry liaison suggests iron ore could remain elevated for an extended period. “Meanwhile, a stronger recovery in steel production outside of China could also provide further support for iron ore and metallurgical coal prices,” it said.What Bloomberg Economics says...“The government has proposed recycling the windfall back into the economy through higher spending and tax cuts. The slower pace of fiscal consolidation provides additional support to monetary policy, but not enough to hasten the withdrawal of the central bank’s stimulus.”-- James McIntyre, economistFor the full note, click hereThe conservative government’s reorientation to big spender is a dramatic turnaround from just 18 months ago when it was driving toward the first budget surplus in a decade. At the time, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was dismissing calls for additional fiscal measures to support a relatively weak economy.In that spirit, the government has set aside concern about debt for now, reflecting low borrowing costs and a better starting position than global peers.Net debt is expected to be at 34.2% of GDP in June next year and peak just shy of A$1 trillion in June 2025, or 40.9% of GDP. That’s about half the U.S. and U.K. levels and about one-third of Japan’s, according to the budget papers.Yet the road to an election by next May is clouded by a sluggish vaccination rollout. The budget assumes overseas borders will remain closed until the middle of next year, suggesting Morrison will be campaigning for another term while the rollout is still unfolding.Another year of hardship for tourism and education is reflected in the budget allocating A$2.1 billion in support for aviation, tourism, the arts and international education providers.Among other key spending items in Frydenberg’s fiscal blueprint are:A$7.8 billion to extend tax relief to low- and middle-income earning AustraliansA$20.7 billion for the extension of a temporary program for expensing and loss carry-back for assets bought by firms that has already supported a rebound of machinery and equipment investmentA$15.2 billion in new commitments for road and railway projects across Australia$17.7 billion for the employment-intensive aged care sector; andA$1.9 billion for the Covid-19 vaccination strategyAndrew Boak, chief economist for Australia at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., argues the government should be trying to drive down unemployment even faster. He contrasts this with the U.S., which expects to achieve full employment by the end of this year.“The question is whether the budget is really ambitious enough,” he said. “On Treasury’s own forecasts they don’t get to full employment for more than two years from now against the backdrop of an inflation undershoot and super-low wages growth for over half a decade.”Still, the budget was well received by the three major credit ratings agencies that reaffirmed Australia’s AAA rating.Clouded OutlookAustralia’s success in navigating the economy through the pandemic is clouded by a downward spiral in ties with its largest trading partner, China. Last week China announced it was suspending a ministerial economic dialog, while Australia is reviewing whether to force a Chinese company to sell a lease to a strategically significant port used by the Australian and U.S. militaries.The budget papers acknowledged the threat in a thinly-veiled reference. “Ongoing global trade tensions and the potential for further trade actions continue to pose risks to the outlook for Australian exports,” they said.The government also faces increased pressure to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions as a consensus emerges among developed nations led by President Joe Biden.The budget response is limited. It sets out A$1.6 billion for priority clean energy technologies.“It was a missed opportunity to do things regarding cleaner and cheaper energy and in terms of diversifying our economy,” Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. The recovery “is hostage to a lot of uncertainty -- the China relationship is one of them, but in the nearer term the vaccine rollout is slower than in” comparable countries.Despite the challenges, the domestic economy looks set to roar, with Treasury forecasting GDP will rise 5.25% this calendar year, before cooling to 2.75% in 2022. The Australian electorate historically reward governments that demonstrate strong economic management.Jill Sheppard, a political analyst at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the budget was politically expedient and a lot would have to go wrong in the next year for Morrison’s government to lose the next election.The budget has “left the Labor opposition with very little to attack the government on,” she said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “Debt and deficit isn’t the order of the day any more -- we see voters not so worried about that as they used to be.”(Updates with finance minister in seventh paragraph, Goldman Sachs in 17th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","['iron', 'global', 'nomura', 'program', 'spending', 'archegos', 'economy', 'billion', 'budget', 'profit', 'lift', 'expansion', 'hit', 'ore', 'bloomberg', 'betting', 'update', 'fiscal', 'despite', 'support']",2021-05-12,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

Nomura,4,Google API,https://www.ijf.org/news/show/nomura-i-want-to-learn-more,Nomura: I Want to Learn More,"Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world.Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura.Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion.So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’.When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension.","Tadahiro Nomura, born 10th December 1974 in Nara, Japan, is one of the most famous judoka in the world. The reason is simple: he is the only judoka to have won three Olympic gold medals (Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004), all in the -60kg weight division, to which a gold medal at the 1997 World Championships in Paris must also be added, among so many other achievements. Behind the medals and the public face, there is also a man who has a lot to say. As the Tokyo Olympic Games are fast approaching, we asked him to comment on his illustrious career and to tell us something of his own judo philosophy.We all know how difficult it is to win an Olympic title. It requires years of preparation and dedication. When one athlete wins the Olympic grail, this is already a fantastic achievement, that often concludes a brilliant career. This, when the same athlete steps up for the second time to the top of the podium, is extraordinary, but when it happens for the third time and a row, there are no words to describe what it really represents.Keeping the motivation throughout such a long period of time is an aspect of Nomura's career that is the most incredible, “I started judo at a young age, when I was just three years old and I grew up within a judo family. As a child I was not strong, but when I arrived at my first Olympic Games, in Atlanta, I was 21, almost 22 and I was full of energy. My first Olympic gold changed my life and especially in judo, because once I became Olympic champion, everybody started to look at me and to study me. I had to work harder to remain on top and that was my first definable motivation.The whole process to go to the Olympic Games is very long and tiring. It is so difficult, but that motivated me. When I became Olympic champion for the second time, in Sydney, I felt that I had achieved something, but I was getting older and I needed a break in my career. I stopped for two years. I didn't know if I could make it again, so I started to travel and I went to San Francisco. There I was not a professional athlete anymore. I was free from the pressure and I learned a lot during those two years, especially when working with children. Actually that's what gave me the motivation to go for another term. After this break, I was missing the pressure of high level competition and was gaining energy from the young people I was working with. I found the extra motivation to start again with the whole preparation process.""Throughout the discussion with Tadahiro Nomura, it became clear that the youth had been the guideline that allowed him to succeed and that today he wants to dedicate even more time to the educational dimension of judo. Before digging into that subject more, we wanted to know if there was a secret to such longevity. When asked, Nomura-San started to answer by mentioning another champion, one who might be able to join him soon with three Olympic titles, “Teddy has already earned two Olympic titles, so if he wins this summer in Tokyo, he will have three Olympic golds as well, but he already has ten world titles, which is absolutely incredible. One half of me wants him to win because that would be fantastic for judo, but the other half wants Japan to win! What I want to tell him is that he needs to put all he has on the mat, with no regrets. Becoming Olympic Champion is not easy. One needs to cultivate a passion for judo and learn to love it. This is my secret. Throughout my life I've learned to love judo. Of course, there is a technical dimension. I've developed my capacity to throw with my special technique, seoi-nage, but beyond that, there is my love for the whole sport. As a Japanese judoka, I believe that it is very important to foster courteousness to the opponent and what I call the 'rei', which is based on respect and mutual prosperity.""A champion is the one who steps on top of the medal podium and who gets all the attention, but behind every man and woman who wins there are many contributors. One of Nomura's main architects was Shinji Hosokawa, Olympic and world champion. ""I met Hosokawa-Sensei at the University in Tenri and he changed my judo career forever. He would always tell me that it is not enough to train hard, but you need to train to win and for that you need to be clever and consistent. The secret is quality. Everyday when I was training I was thinking about the Olympic Games and I was imagining how it would be to lose, so I was prepared. Hosokawa-Sensei was always beside me. He helped me to enjoy judo training, to have fun, but at the same time to feel the pressure and the risk of losing. When I arrived in Atlanta and he was sitting in the coaches’ chair, I felt good and ready. I admire him because throughout his life he has continued improving and learning. He speaks English and French and he travelled a lot. He became a great champion before becoming a great coach and he is a great man as well, on and off the tatami. He's an example.""Today Tadahiro Nomura is never far away from judo. Being a well known TV announcer in Japan, he is also a public speaker who is keen to share his experience to help young people and athletes to reach their dreams. With the Tokyo Olympics just over the horizon, he is also in charge of two young judoka, who we all know very well, “I've been working with the Abe siblings for a while already. Abe Uta and Abe Hifumi are two great athletes. Normally in Japan, you become really famous once you have won the Olympic titles, which is not their case yet, but they are already well known in the country. They are exposed and I am there to help them and to guide them so they can benefit from the best training conditions as well as the best media presence. Beside my TV occupation and the Abes, I also organise judo clinics in and out of Japan, although with the global pandemic it is not possible to travel for the moment. Since I retired, I spend most of my time in a suit and tie. I miss the judogi, so whenever it's possible I like to go back on the tatami. Every time I have the chance to travel and participate in a judo clinic, I am happy. I feel that people respect me for my achievements, but I mostly feel the passion that judoka around the world have for our sport.""To understand a little bit more about the secret of the great champion, we need to understand better where he is coming from and what, at one point, made him reach the summit. ""As I said, I started judo at a very young age. My whole family was involved in judo. My grandfather founded a small family dojo named Houtokukan Nomura Dojo. My father was a successful high school judo coach. Also, my uncle became Olympic champion in Munich in 1972: Toyokazu Nomura. I can say that it was part of our daily life and when I started practising, the spirit of my grandfather inhabited our dojo. I don't remember having seen him on the tatami, but I remember his smile, always a happy face. You know, the key was the fun. In the Nomura dojo we had fun! Personally speaking, I had fun, even if I was crying a lot too, because I was not so strong and I was losing a lot. I didn't like that. When I entered middle school I was only 32kg and nobody believed I would be a good judoka, even if I wanted to be the best. When I was 12 or 13 I wanted to be a hero of the sport, but that was far beyond my reach. So I decided to take it step by step. When I turned 17 and I watched the Barcelona Olympic Games, I wanted to be there, but I had the feeling that those athletes on TV were on another planet. Then I went to university and I defeated Sonoda, who was already a world champion. I realised that maybe I had a chance. When I was young I was losing a lot, mainly because I was competing against heavier judoka, but throughout all those loses, I've learned a lot. That was when I started to improve my technique, because I needed to find solutions.""Discovering the solutions to become better, through failures and defeats, is an important factor in Nomura's future success and this is exactly what he wants to transmit to the next generation of judoka, ""I would love now to have my own dojo where I could teach young children the secret to becoming a true judoka. But then the global pandemic started and I had to adapt. So for the time being I organise some judo classes online, on my YouTube channel ‘Nomura Dojo’. So, for the time being, I organise some judo classes online, on YouTube. Discover more at: CLICK HERE It's a nice way to interact with the judo community. For the moment I do it in Japan, but I'd be happy to share it beyond Japan. I am really looking forward to being back with children on the tatami again."" When Tadahiro Nomura started to talk about education, the discussion took another turn, opening another dimension. ""Some years ago, I travelled to France, with Uemura-Sensei and the Kodokan. I had the feeling that I knew a lot about the sport side of judo, but there I started to understand a little better what jita kyoei meant. Ok, so judo is an element of budo, with one person facing another and one of them winning, but judo is much more than that. It is a form of education. Judo carries real values that are all embedded in the bow, the rei. I want to keep learning more about that and I want to communicate more as well. This is what makes judo different from any other activity. This is what Jigoro Kano gave us. When you are an athlete it is not easy to think about education. When I was a child I wanted to win. Parents and teachers want their children to win, but before that we should teach them to love judo for what it is: a beautiful educational tool and a fun activity. After my career, I realised that for me it was not always fun to be on the tatami and to train hard. It was difficult, but every time it was really hard, I would remember the fun I had when I was a child and then suddenly everything would become easier. I started to process all I've learned, but I still have a lot to discover and this is what I want to do now.I admire all the projects that the IJF does, like Judo for Children and Judo for Peace. These are fantastic ideas because they bring to the masses a dimension of judo invented by Jigoro Kano Shihan himself. All these programmes offer possibilities for everyone to shine through judo and find their own answers to the challenges that we have to face. I know the power of judo and I'm really identifying myself within that. Over the past years, the number of judoka in Japan has decreased but I'm happy to see that it's increasing on the whole, around the world, thanks to the educational programmes that are set up. I believe that it is also through education that we will find solutions in my country."" We could listen to Tadahiro Nomura for hours but time flies and everyone has to jump on the next meeting in our busy timetables. We had just a few more minutes to get a conclusion, ""I have one regret, that I could not win a fourth Olympic title. I thought it was possible. I was ready but then I went to a training camp where I got injured and I had to stop. What I can tell you is that throughout my career I've learned a lot and I'm still learning a lot. I want now to make my own contribution, not as an athlete, but as an educator. I may be a champion, but I still need to study more and more. Judo is not only about the medals, it is much more than that.""","['champion', 'started', 'japan', 'judoka', 'young', 'judo', 'nomura', 'lot', 'world', 'learn', 'olympic']",2021-05-10,ijf.org,EUREX

The latest in this category is Glenn Fairbairn, a former Deutsche Bank managing director, who has arrived in London.Nomura insiders say Fairbairn has been on board for a few weeks and that he's responsible for equity solutions trading in EMEA and for prime finance in Europe. Last week, Nomura suspended Dougal Brech, global head of the prime-brokerage division, along with Joshua Kurek, head of prime broking in the U.S., and co-head of global equities Michael Caperonis.Fairbairn therefore looks like some extra muscle in Europe. He spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a managing director and held roles as everything from head of Asian structuring, to co-head of the bank's strategic equity transactions Group (SETG) for Europe and emerging markets. Fairbairn left Deutsche in June 2019 ahead of the closure of the German bank's equities business. He's spent the past few years as an independent advisor.Nomura's other big hire in London this year is FX star and veteran Kevin Connors, who is expected to build out a team.The Japanese bank announced its full year results for 2020 last week. Thanks to Archegos, the wholesale bank made a loss of $1.5bn for the full year. However, fixed income sales and trading revenues were up 31% and investment banking revenues (M&A, ECM and DCM) were up 35%.In comments accompanying last week's results, Takumi Kitamura, Nomura's CFO, said Archegos, ""was a very specific individual case,"" and that Nomura will be reviewing its risk management framework to avoid a repeat. Kitamura added that the U.S. business is strategically important to Nomura and there's no intention of changing direction (for now). In a separate media briefing, Nomura CEO Kentaro Okuda confirmed that the bank has no major plans to change its U.S. strategy.Nonetheless, this week's bonus round could have implications for strategy in future: if Nomura pays dismally, it may struggle to retain staff, particularly in areas like fixed income trading that had an excellent year.Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you’d like to share?

Here’s why.,"The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low.It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks.The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous?","Oops.As a former Federal Reserve chair herself, now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen should have known that her comments about the possibility of a need for an interest-rate hike would send markets into a tizzy, and by the end of the day she had walked back her remarks. No matter, as they’d brought about a classic rotation — the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.09% dived 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.36% actually rose slightly.What was interesting was that the bond market didn’t follow suit. The 10-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities actually fell, to negative 0.81% — nearly a three-month low. It is noteworthy that the market for interest rates didn’t see anything terribly new or interesting in Yellen’s remarks about interest rates. The currency market wasn’t volatile. So maybe the stock market was vulnerable to selling.Bank of America reports that, of its clients, hedge funds have been “extreme” sellers of stocks. The rolling four-week average flows for hedge funds were the lowest in the history of this series, which dates back to 2008 — and were three standard deviations below the average.The hedge-fund selling was most concentrated in the communications-services and information-technology sectors, according to the BofA data — i.e., the tech winners that have thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Who’s buying? Retail clients were the only group to buy U.S. equities for the third week in a row and have been net buyers for 10 straight weeks, per Bank of America.Why would hedge funds be getting nervous? Well, the April payrolls report on Friday is expected to be a seven-digit affair, after nearly topping a million in March. Even with Federal Reserve policy makers at pains to dismiss signs of surging inflation, they can’t ignore a rapidly healing labor market, so official data showing a surge in jobs creation will inevitably cause market discussion of when the central bank will pull back on its bond buying.“As usual, it looks like the connection between legacy ‘duration proxy’ tech sector/’secular growth’ is the risk into the next two months of ‘peak’ U.S. economic data base-effect, with this week’s heavy U.S. data slate culminating in the CRITICAL Friday NFP, which is expected to be a WHOPPING +++ print and is set to dictate the timing of Fed ‘tapering’ socialization,” said Nomura Securities strategist Charlie McElligott.How whopping? Steve Englander, head of global G-10 currency strategy at Standard Chartered, said a payrolls number in excess of 2 million would scare investors, and anything above 1.5 million would cause “uncertainty.” In other words, the risk is that by Friday, traders might be talking like Yellen did on Tuesday.GM tops forecastsADP reported a 742,000 rise in private-sector payrolls for April, which was below economist expectations.

Nomura,4,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-nomura-still-betting-global-060747202.html,"Japan's Nomura still betting on global expansion to lift profit, despite Archegos hit","According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

This series highlights the 10 most compelling papers with ‘practitioner takeaways’ by BNP Paribas Asset Management investment professionals. We sponsor GRASFI to bring academic rigour to the pressing challenges of sustainable finance and investment. Our goal is to share these reflections with clients and the industry. We invite you to visit the GRASFI Conference website.""Sustainability in the time of uncertaintyThe COVID-19 pandemic had a profound and immediate effect on global stock markets. The US S&P 500 equity index fell by 33.6% between 20 February and 23 March 2020 in US dollar terms as lockdown measures were enacted across much of the developed world to contain the virus.[2]As markets rebounded on news of huge fiscal and monetary stimulus from governments and central bank support, investors piled back into equities. It was notable that sustainable funds drew significant inflows[3] on hopes of a ‘green recovery’.As investment approaches centring on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors grow more popular, understanding how assets perform in adverse market conditions is a key test of the viability of these strategies.In the white paper ‘Sustainability in the time of uncertainty’, the authors have analysed the performance of S&P 1500 companies during last year’s crash.US stocks scoring higher on ESG factors by rating agencies OWL Analytics and TruValue Labs demonstrated ‘significantly higher’ returns over the period, the study reports – particularly during the first few ‘extreme’ days of the market turmoil.Sustainability componentsThe study decomposes ESG scores based on three ‘components’ to explain performance:UncertaintyInvestor sentiment‘Idiosyncratic sustainability factor’.The last of these was the strongest factor, the authors report.To analyse uncertainty, the authors use the ‘Knightian uncertainty’ measure to differentiate between risks and ambiguities. Knightian uncertainty explains situations in which information is known, but the outcome is not, and situations in which not all information is available[4] – effectively, ‘known unknowns’ and ‘unknown unknowns’.The study plots ESG scores against nine measures of risk and uncertainty based on data from January 2017 to June 2019. Of these, seven demonstrate a ‘clear pattern’, namely that stocks rated the highest for ESG qualities ‘on average exhibited less risk ex post than the lowest rated ESG stocks’.The authors also report a link between investor trust in sustainability factors and stock resilience, indicating that investors value companies with strong sustainability qualities during times of market stress.This is based on two analyses of ESG scores and company performance, one controlling for financial performance metrics linked to ESG factors, and the other for risk and sentiment measures.Those companies with higher ESG scores usually demonstrate lower risk and higher sentiment scores, with the risk element the more obvious factor, the authors report.The idiosyncratic sustainability factorOn top of the risk and sentiment factors, there is a third residual factor identified by the researchers feeding into performance during crisis periods.By drilling down into the various elements of ‘E’, ‘S’ and ‘G’, the authors report that individual factors have a particularly strong bearing on the performance of individual stocks. These include companies’ performance onPollution preventionStaff pay and job satisfactionDiversity and workers’ rights.During February-March this year, companies with higher scores on these metrics are shown to have performed better than the market average, demonstrating the role these factors play in a company’s resilience to market shocks.“Overall, these results suggest that the residual ESG component carries important information regarding firms’ sustainability conduct, particularly in the governance space, that cannot be explained with market risk or sentiment,” the authors state.The authors put their findings to the test through experiments with groups of investors tested during bull and bear market conditions – 23-30 November 2019, and 13-20 March 2020.The tests were designed to assess attitudes to risk and uncertainty. They included one group of investors given financial information and another given additional sustainability information.Before the 2020 crash, there was no difference between the two groups, but when tested last March, participants clearly preferred lower risk investments.In addition, risk-averse individuals with access to ESG information were shown to be more likely to allocate more to equity during the market plunge than other risk-averse investors who were not given ESG information.This latter finding is in line with the idea that companies with higher ESG scores are seen as lower risk investments.At a time when more money than ever before is flowing into sustainable investments, the paper identifies behavioural factors and underlying drivers of company performance that show clearly that companies with strong ESG credentials can perform well in times of uncertainty.Commenting on the paper, Alex Bernhardt, global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said:“This paper highlights the positive link between companies with a strong sustainability performance and business resilience by evaluating share price performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found that companies with strong sustainability characteristics are considered lower risk investments – this is aligned with our view that a strong performance on material ESG issues can help companies mitigate risk.”Also read these blog articles on ‘GRASFI papers’:More on sustainable investingAny views expressed here are those of the author as of the date of publication, are based on available information, and are subject to change without notice.

This document does not constitute investment advice.The value of investments and the income they generate may go down as well as up and it is possible that investors will not recover their initial outlay. Past performance is no guarantee for future returns.Investing in emerging markets, or specialised or restricted sectors is likely to be subject to a higher-than-average volatility due to a high degree of concentration, greater uncertainty because less information is available, there is less liquidity or due to greater sensitivity to changes in market conditions (social, political and economic conditions).Some emerging markets offer less security than the majority of international developed markets. For this reason, services for portfolio transactions, liquidation and conservation on behalf of funds invested in emerging markets may carry greater risk.[1] The Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment is a worldwide network of 19 leading universities that was established in 2017 to promote rigorous academic research into finance and responsible investment.

REUTERS/Giorgio PerottinoConcise insights on global finance.-----------------------------------------------CALM BEFORE THE STORM. Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) has bolstered its bad credit defences. Italy’s largest lender on Wednesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit of 1.5 billion euros . It’s the bank’s best quarter since 2008, delivering an annualised return on tangible equity of 12%, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The performance owes much to lower bad debt provisions. Intesa set aside some 400 million euros, equivalent to 0.35% of total loans on an annualised basis. That’s less than some European rivals.Boss Carlo Messina and investors know the lull won’t last. Intesa shares trade at around 0.8 times its tangible book value, implying an 8% return on tangible equity this year. Once Italy lifts a ban on layoffs, many private clients will default. Yet, as consumer credit accounts for just 6% of its loans, less than half the equivalent share for BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Intesa is better placed to weather an increase in defaults.

Shareholders in Société Générale (SOGN.PA) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are unaccustomed to good news. The perennial European bank laggards bucked the habit on Thursday with blowout first-quarter results. Frédéric Oudéa’s French lender reported a juicy 10.1% return on tangible equity, after stripping out one-off charges. UniCredit’s new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel unveiled a less stellar but still respectable 6.9% ROTE, also on an underlying basis. Both banks’ shares rose 4%.It’s unlikely to last. Both Oudéa and Orcel expect bad-debt charges to rise in the rest of the year. Revenues from investment banking will probably fall as market volatility subsides. Meanwhile analysts reckon SocGen’s costs will consume 73% of 2021 income, compared with BNP Paribas’ (BNPP.PA) 68%. UniCredit’s equivalent ratio of 58% is much worse than Intesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP.MI) 52%. Little wonder the French and Italian banks respectively trade at a 38% and 54% discount to their two closest rivals, using price to forward tangible book value. Oudéa and Orcel will remain stuck at the bottom of the class.

The 10-year breakeven inflation rate - a measure of expectations of inflation in 10 years time - rose to its highest since March 2013.A weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday helped persuade market participants that the Fed would keep rates low and continue purchasing assets, even if inflation rises. The United States created a little more than a quarter of the jobs that economists had forecast last month and the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher.“I think the biggest problem for the dollar right now is what’s happening to real yields, which continue to tumble. We’re seeing inflation breakevens continue to push higher,” said Daniel Katzive, head of foreign exchange strategy North America at BNP Paribas. “This is creating a lot of vulnerability for the dollar.”In recent years, rising inflation expectations have helped the dollar because investors have assumed interest rates would be raised in response to higher prices.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was last at 90.205, up 0.06% on the day, having earlier hit its lowest since Feb. 25.The market this week will be focused on U.S. consumer price data reported Wednesday as well as retail sales on Friday. Wednesday’s CPI data will show the state of inflation today, and while that may have some effect on the market, the higher breakeven rates seen Monday reflect broader bets that inflation will rise in the next several years.“The Fed will let inflation run hot into 2023. I would be so shocked if the Fed hiked interest rates in 2022,” said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.The British pound was the biggest gainer among the G10 currencies, rallying as high as $1.416, the highest since Feb. 25. It was last up 1.02% at $1.413. This was despite Scotland’s leader saying that another referendum on independence is inevitable after her party’s resounding election victory.Also benefiting was the Canadian dollar, which was 0.36% stronger on the day to $1.209, the highest since September 2017.In cryptocurrencies, ether extended this month’s record run, surging to an unprecedented $4,148.88.

""The removal of the cap on the franc -- it was a shock... the instalments jumped by 100%.""Thousands of Polish borrowers took out the loans more than a decade ago to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates but faced higher costs when the zloty slumped.Many, like Rowinski, have decided to take the banks to court over clauses they say are abusive and the problem could cost the banking sector over 200 billion zlotys ($53 billion) in worst-case scenario estimates.

""If the banks start to propose some sensible... conversion maybe I will lean towards that, not suing the bank.""In December, the head of Poland's financial market regulator KNF proposed a plan for banks to convert foreign currency loans into zlotys as if they had been taken out in the local currency originally.However, so far only the nation's largest lender PKO BP has committed itself to settlements, with others waiting for Tuesday's guidance.""If the Supreme Court guidance is unfavourable for the banks, they will need to increase their provisioning against losses related to these mortgages and may lose bargaining power in out of court settlements,"" ratings agency Moody's said in a recent note.The KNF estimates that the cost to banks of court cases could be between 70.5 billion and 234 billion zlotys, while the cost of its settlement plan would be 34.5 billion zlotys.The Polish banking sector had a net profit of 7.7 billion zlotys in 2020.""In the blackest scenario... the banking sector is seriously threatened, a situation in which some banks are insolvent is possible,"" said Tadeusz Bialek, deputy head of the Polish Bank Association (ZBP).Rowinski hopes the Supreme Court will give a clear line for judgements.

He explains here how autonomous vehicles can bring life and economic dynamism back to the parts of France that need it most. Yann is also Chairman of the Digital Commission and the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles working group of the French Insurance Federation.We need to think differently about AVsMention ‘Autonomous Vehicle’ and most people picture a man – probably white and possibly a busy executive – reading the news, or replying to emails, while his luxury electric vehicle navigates the traffic by itself. This reality is already upon us, with many automakers releasing Level 3 (conditional automation) vehicles into the market.According to this image, AVs are a natural continuation of the classic single-car-ownership model; i.e. a technological disruption that does not address the social and economic issues of our day.The Movin’On Community of Interest is a working group that brings together several ecosystem stakeholders to develop a common vision and experiment new mobility solutions togethers. We are leading one of them, dedicated to shifting the discussion away from technological advance for its own sake and toward the use of technology to promote social good.Movin’On toward sustainable and inclusive mobilityMovin’On, created and inspired by Michelin, is gathering collective and individual change makers and giving them the means to innovate together for more mobility with less impact. Besides Macif and Michelin, there are other major players from the private sector involved in the Community of Interest to recontextualize mobility innovation in terms of social impact. These include BNP Paribas Cardif, Deloitte, Faurecia, Kantar, Maif, Microsoft, Orange, SNCF and Vinci; as well as key actors from government, civil society and the scientific community.Movin’On has numerous interdisciplinary teams within its LAB, a think and do tank, engaged in answering questions like: ‘How to reshape last mile delivery operations and experience for good?’ and ‘How can we securely share data to create value and improve sustainable mobility?’. Our Community of Interest is dedicated to answering: ‘How can we encourage the adoption of autonomous vehicles through sustainable and inclusive mobility insights?’.Technopush versus Social SolidarityIn 2020, we participated in studies carried out by the Védécom Institute, who specialise in the subject of mobility and autonomy. One of our striking findings was that there is overwhelming bias in the media and the popular imagination for ‘technopush’, whereby technology – not social good – drives interest and publicity. Of the 100 000 or so articles on AVs we came across, only 185 discussed the social impact of this new technology and the possibilities for inclusive and sustainable transport.It’s a bit like social media, which was first seen as an unvarnished good, before – as Gartner’s Hype Cycle describes it – the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ gave way to the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’. Our research suggests that the French public intuits the potential for disillusionment; they’re prepared to support AVs, so long as they prove to be safe and that they expand employment opportunities and reduce environmental impact.Interestingly, rural areas were less supportive of AVs. But if we have our way, these environments will benefit greatly from cheap, efficient, carbon-light solutions to getting around, finding work and building communities.AVs as a solution to economic decline in sparsely populated areasHow can we convince the public, as well as major institutional players, that the real opportunity for AVs is not as a continuation of the traditional mobility model, but as a positive disruption that boosts local economies and expands access to millions of the underserved? This notion is encapsulated in our Movin’On Community of Interest motto: ‘Mobility for all, Autonomy for all’.We believe this can be achieved by using AV technology for shared electric shuttles that mix on-demand elements of ride-hailing with traditional public transport elements of routes and timetables. If a country like France – which has large areas that are sparsely populated – can get this right, it will do unimaginable good for those outlying towns, villages and suburbs where millions find their lives and livelihoods constrained by lack of mobility options.I live in Coulonges-sur-L’Autize, a small village 25-minutes’ drive north of MACIF’s headquarters in Niort. It’s a joy to live close to a Regional Natural Park (Marais Poitevin) and not too far from the beauty spots along the Bay of Biscay coastline. And yet I see that a village or small town can be a prison for those – be they a single mother or elderly couple – without ready access to mobility.We will know that the initiative has succeeded when we’ve increased the sharing of assets, decreased environmental impact, and rejuvenated business and social activity in the high street, particularly for smaller towns and villages.The commercial viability of autonomous vehiclesIf shared autonomous shuttles really are key to reversing the decline of peri-urban areas, then why don’t we see the big OEMs talking more about it? Clearly, the commercial argument for the solution has not been properly made. Our committee is of the opinion that not only can AVs improve mobility access for underserved areas, but that the model is commercially viable.Currently, AVs are expensive because the data and intelligence must be self-contained in the vehicle. But if AVs operated within a geofenced area, along discrete routes and supervised centrally, then the intelligence and data would be shared across the system, reducing costs. If this solution for a certain suburb or village proves to be scalable, then it means we could duplicate the model across the country.Explore, prepare, testOur Community of Interest began in 2020 and rolls out of three yearly phases: explore, prepare and test. By 2022 we should be able to verify if indeed a replicable model for widespread AV use in sparse areas is possible. In the meantime, it’s important that insurance companies like Macif consider the risk and liability problems posed by AVs.In the future, it’s possible that an autonomous system will reduce accident risk to zero. But current reality says AVs and non-AVs are going to be operating on the same roads for some years to come. With fears around automation and artificial intelligence relegating humans to irrelevance, it is important that a company like Macif – which was founded for mutual benefit in protection of life, family and property – leads the discussion.AVs are set to disrupt millions of truck-driving, delivery and ride-hailing jobs. We need to think about how technology can ameliorate the digital divide and expand opportunities to those on the margins of economic activity. There is no reason why a country like France cannot use AVs to boost economic dynamism and social activity in sparsely populated areas, improving the lives of millions.Do EVs excite your electrons?

BNP Paribas,5,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activepure-technology-partners-bnp-paribas-163000072.html,ActivePure Technology Partners with BNP Paribas Real Estate Netherlands,"According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

Not so in Asia though, where MSCI Inc.’s key gauge for this category of shares has returned more than 9 per cent so far this year, beating the broader regional benchmark by almost five percentage points.The index, which excludes the Japanese market and is heavily weighted to financials, information technology and materials companies, has also outperformed value stocks, a favorite of many investors the world over this year. Reasons for the strength range from a recovery in banks on expectations for higher interest rates to the rally in Taiwanese tech stocks.“We expect economic growth to rebound strongly in the next 2-3 years, potentially achieving its highest rate for decades as pent up demand is released and policy settings remain expansionary,” said Jeffrey Roskell, a portfolio manager for the JPMorgan Asia Equity Dividend Fund. “Profitability and dividends are set to recover.”The outperformance of stocks with better income potential has also come as confidence in the outlook returns to company boardrooms in Asia, with about 45 per cent of stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index resuming or increasing dividends this year versus the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That said, the ratio is almost 10 percentage points higher for the S&P 500 Index.More recently, however, Asia’s high-dividend-yield stocks have seen their outperformance over the broader market fade.Manishi Raychaudhuri, BNP Paribas SA ’s Asia-Pacific head of equity research, said investors should be selective, cautioning that the dividend theme tends to underperform when bond yields rise and the hunt for returns see investors move into areas like investment grade fixed income.Among top dividend-yielding sectors, his team expects financials and materials to have room to increase earnings. By contrast, there are doubts about the earnings and payout sustainability of Chinese property and office real estate investment trusts, Raychaudhuri said.Roskell’s fund, which has a yield of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent and has outperformed the regional benchmark so far this year, has been rotating out of defensive stocks into value names lately on expectations of early economic recovery and higher interest rates.Some others are more optimistic.“The dividend-paying element in a stock points us to quality -- a synonym of balance sheet resilience and stability in operations,” said Frank Tsui, a senior fund manager at Value Partners who is involved in the firm’s high-dividend strategy. Investing in dividend stocks “makes sense” in the current environment, he said.Tsui sees growing interest in China’s dividend story, in sectors ranging from white goods to property developers.

Prior to the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, the total number of shares in the Company is 663 639 370.The purpose of the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares is to increase the value of a single share and thus to improve the trade conditions of the shares and the reliability of the price formation of the shares. Thus, there is a particularly weighty financial reason for the Company to reduce the quantity of Company's shares. This arrangement shall not affect the equity of the Company.In respect of shareholders registered on the Transaction Day (as defined below) in the shareholders’ register of Nexstim held by Euroclear Finland Ltd, the reduction of the quantity of shares shall be carried out as follows:The reduction of the quantity of Company's shares shall be carried out so that the Company shall, on 14 May 2021 (the ""Transaction Day""), issue new Company shares to each such shareholder of the Company without consideration so that the number of all shares per book-entry accounts owned by the shareholders of the Company are divisible by the number 100. The maximum quantity of Company's own shares transferred by the Company shall be 100-1 shares multiplied by the number of such book-entry accounts on the Transaction Day, on which the Company's shares are held, and which are owned by the shareholders of the Company. Based on the Board of Director’s estimate on the number of Company's shareholders of Nexstim on the date of the Board’s proposal, the maximum amount of new shares issued by the Company in the share issue to such shareholders is 1,000,000 new shares of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company is entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the issuance of shares without consideration.On the Transaction Day, at the same time with the aforementioned issue of Company's new shares, the Company shall redeem without consideration a number of shares from each such shareholder of the Company. The number of shares to be redeemed by the Company will be determined according to the redemption ratio of 100/1 based on the ownership of such shareholders on the Transaction Day. In other words, for every 100 shares of the Company 100-1 Company shares shall be redeemed. The Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the redemptions of shares.The Company's shares, which are redeemed in connection with the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, shall be annulled immediately following the redemption by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.

The directed share issue is connected to the completion of the reduction of the number of shares and justified by the reasons set forth above in this section.

The number of shares to be redeemed by the Company will be determined according to the redemption ratio of 100/1 based on ownership of the Company’s shares by the Receiving Shareholders on the Transaction Day (according to share and shareholder information available with Euroclear Finland Oy) to execute the reduction of the number of shares, and such number(s) of reduced shares (per each Receiving Shareholder) are then adjusted, if needed, by the above-mentioned transfer of shares to the Receiving Shareholders based on their actual ownership of the Company’s shares on the Record Day (as defined below). The Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the redemptions of shares.The Company's shares, which are redeemed in connection with the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, shall be annulled immediately following the redemption by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.The shares issued to the Company itself will be registered in the trade register by 17 May 2021.

Prior to the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, the total number of shares in the Company is 663 639 370.The purpose of the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares is to increase the value of a single share and thus to improve the trade conditions of the shares and the reliability of the price formation of the shares. Thus, there is a particularly weighty financial reason for the Company to reduce the quantity of Company's shares. This arrangement shall not affect the equity of the Company.In respect of shareholders registered on the Transaction Day (as defined below) in the shareholders’ register of Nexstim held by Euroclear Finland Ltd, the reduction of the quantity of shares shall be carried out as follows:The reduction of the quantity of Company's shares shall be carried out so that the Company shall, on 14 May 2021 (the ""Transaction Day""), issue new Company shares to each such shareholder of the Company without consideration so that the number of all shares per book-entry accounts owned by the shareholders of the Company are divisible by the number 100. The maximum quantity of Company's own shares transferred by the Company shall be 100-1 shares multiplied by the number of such book-entry accounts on the Transaction Day, on which the Company's shares are held, and which are owned by the shareholders of the Company. Based on the Board of Director’s estimate on the number of Company's shareholders of Nexstim on the date of the Board’s proposal, the maximum amount of new shares issued by the Company in the share issue to such shareholders is 1,000,000 new shares of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company is entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the issuance of shares without consideration.On the Transaction Day, at the same time with the aforementioned issue of Company's new shares, the Company shall redeem without consideration a number of shares from each such shareholder of the Company. The number of shares to be redeemed by the Company will be determined according to the redemption ratio of 100/1 based on the ownership of such shareholders on the Transaction Day. In other words, for every 100 shares of the Company 100-1 Company shares shall be redeemed. The Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the redemptions of shares.The Company's shares, which are redeemed in connection with the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, shall be annulled immediately following the redemption by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company. The reduction of the quantity of Company's shares shall be carried out in the book-entry system at the end of trading day on Nasdaq Helsinki on 14 May 2021 i.e. on the Transaction Day (i.e. on the record day). The annulment of the shares and the Company's new total number of shares are entered in the trade register by 17 May 2021. Trading with the Company's new total number of shares on Nasdaq Helsinki with new ISIN code will begin approximately on 17 May 2021 on which date the reduced number of shares shall also appear on each book entry account of the shareholders registered in the shareholders’ register of Nexstim held by Euroclear Finland Ltd.In respect of shareholders with shares registered in a) Euroclear Sweden AB’s Securities System (whether registered in the name of or a nominee or directly of the shareholder) and b) holders of nominee registered shares registered in Euroclear Finland Ltd’s Bookentry System, the reduction of the quantity of shares shall be carried out as follows:For the purposes of execution of the reduction of the number of shares, the Annual General Meeting of shareholders resolved on issuance of 350,000 new shares to the Company itself without payment. The directed share issue is connected to the completion of the reduction of the number of shares and justified by the reasons set forth above in this section. For the sake of clarity, the number of shares to be issued to the Company itself is calculated based on the reduced number of shares in the Company, and not the number of the shares prior to the reduction.The shares issued to the Company itself are to be re-issued i.e. transferred from the Company without consideration to such shareholders (the “Receiving Shareholders”) holding on the Record Day (as defined below) a) shares registered in Euroclear Sweden AB’s Securities System whether registered in the name of or a nominee or directly of the Shareholder or b) nominee registered shares registered in Euroclear Finland Ltd’s Bookentry System, the amount of which (a or b) is not divisible by 100, to the extent required by their shareholding in the Company being divisible by the number 100. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to pass a resolution on transfer of such shares from the Company to the Receiving Shareholders as well as decide upon terms related to such share issue(s)/ transfers.In connection with the redemption of the Company's shares held by shareholders registered in the shareholders’ register of Nexstim held by Euroclear Finland Ltd, the Company shall also redeem without consideration a number of shares from each Receiving Shareholder. The number of shares to be redeemed by the Company will be determined according to the redemption ratio of 100/1 based on ownership of the Company’s shares by the Receiving Shareholders on the Transaction Day (according to share and shareholder information available with Euroclear Finland Oy) to execute the reduction of the number of shares, and such number(s) of reduced shares (per each Receiving Shareholder) are then adjusted, if needed, by the above-mentioned transfer of shares to the Receiving Shareholders based on their actual ownership of the Company’s shares on the Record Day (as defined below). The Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to resolve on all other matters related to the redemptions of shares.The Company's shares, which are redeemed in connection with the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares, shall be annulled immediately following the redemption by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.The shares issued to the Company itself will be registered in the trade register by 17 May 2021. Trading with the Company's new total number of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm (and Nasdaq Helsinki) with new ISIN code will begin approximately on 17 May 2021 (Trading Day). The record day (the “Record Day”) for the reduction of the quantity of Company's shares shall be a) in respect of shares registered in Euroclear Sweden AB’s Securities System (whether registered in the name of or a nominee or directly of the shareholder) 18 May 2021 and b) in respect of nominee registered shares registered in Euroclear Finland Ltd’s Bookentry System 14 May 2021. The transfers of shares from the Company to the Receiving Shareholders required for the final adjustments of their number of shares (after reduction) are expected to take place and be recorded in book-entry accounts at the latest on 17 May in Finland and 19 May 2021 in Sweden.Any own shares in the possession of the Company after transactions with the Receiving Shareholders will be annulled. The arrangement, if it is realized, will not require the shareholders to take any action. No part of the arrangement shall be carried out unless all the other parts of the arrangement are carried out as well.If necessary, the trading with the Company's share on Nasdaq Helsinki or Nasdaq Stockholm shall be temporarily interrupted in order to perform necessary technical measures in the trading facility after the Transaction Day.It was noted that the authorized maximum amount of shares which may be issued under all outstanding authorizations (whether as new or existing shares or option rights or other rights to shares) is also divided with the above-mentioned principle that one share will after the reverse split be equal to 100 shares.7 AUTHORISING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECIDE ON THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES AS WELL AS THE ISSUANCE OF OTHER SPECIAL RIGHTS ENTITLING TO SHARESThe Board of Directors was authorised to decide on (i) the issuance of new shares and/or (ii) the transfer of the Company’s own shares and/or (iii) the issuance of special rights referred to in Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Companies Act with the following terms:Right to shares:New shares may be issued and the Company’s own shares transferred• to the Company’s shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings in the Company; or• deviating from the shareholders’ pre-emptive right through one or more directed share issue, if the Company has a weighty financial reason to do so, such as the use of shares as consideration for possible acquisitions or other arrangements related to the company’s business (including the arrangement regarding the reducing of the quantity of the Company’s shares), financing of investments.The new shares can also be issued to the Company itself free of charge.

Euroclear,0,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kinneviks-board-decided-final-terms-060000762.html,Kinnevik's Board has decided the final terms and timetable for the Zalando distribution,"According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

While the Company was incorporated in Finland, its operations have since expanded across Europe and the world, and currently the Company is a multinational company having operative actions in several countries. The conversion into an SE, which currently is the only supranational corporate form available in Europe, is expected to emphasise the international reach of the Company’s operations and strengthen its European identity. The aim is to make the group structure more transparent and leaner from governance perspective.Pursuant to Article 37 paragraph 6 of the Council Regulation (EC) 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE), one or more independent experts must before the general meeting deciding on the Conversion certify that the Company has net assets at least equivalent to its capital plus those reserves which must not be distributed under the law or the articles of association. The Company’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, has issued the said certificate on 24 March 2021 and it has been enclosed to this notice as Appendix 3 .(b) Amending the Articles of AssociationThe above-mentioned Conversion requires that the Articles of Association of the Company be amended as set forth in the Terms of Conversion.Provided that the Extraordinary General Meeting approves the proposal of the Board of Directors relating to the Conversion in item (a) above, the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to amend the Company’s Articles of Association as follows:(i) Article 1 of the Articles of Association is proposed to be amended to feature a new indication of corporate form in the Company’s trade name, and the Article reads as follows:1 Trade Name and Registered DomicileThe trade name of the Company is Ferratum SE. The registered domicile of the company is Helsinki, Finland.(ii) Article 3 of the Articles of Association is proposed to be changed to include a reference to appointed intervals at which the Board of Directors shall meet, and the amended Article reads as follows:3 Board of Directors and Managing DirectorThe Board of Directors shall be comprised of no fewer than three (3) and no more than nine (9) members. The term of the members of the Board of Directors shall expire at the close of the first annual general meeting following the meeting at which the Board was elected.The Chairman and the Vice Chairman shall be appointed by the Board of Directors from amongst its members.The Board of Directors shall meet at least once every three months to discuss the progress and foreseeable development of the Company’s business.The Company shall have a Managing Director to be appointed by the Board of Directors.(7) Amending the Articles of AssociationProvided that the Extraordinary General Meeting approves the proposals of the Board of Directors under item (6) above, the Board of Directors proposes that Article 1 of the Articles of Association of the Company be amended to introduce a new trade name for the Company as follows:1 Trade Name and Registered DomicileThe trade name of the Company is Multitude SE.

At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment.

The shorthanded Padres wound up beating Colorado 8-1 on Tuesday night, boosted by Manny Machado's home run and five RBIs, but suddenly found themselves in a precarious position. Padres manager Jayce Tingler said he anticipated being able to play Wednesday’s doubleheader at Coors Field as scheduled. ""You never really plan out these scenarios, but we know things are going to come up,” he said. “Our guys are going to be ready. If they’re coming from Triple-A or whatever, we’ve got a lot of faith in our minor league crew that’s preparing these guys and they’re going to come in. At the end of the day, we’re planning on 14 innings tomorrow. We’ve got (Yu) Darvish and (Blake) Snell going and we’re going to be ready to play ball.” “Obviously it’s not ideal, but I want to give credit to our guys tonight. We had a lot of hectic things going on,” he said. “We had a short bench and everybody stepped up and filled in.” Tatis tested positive for COVID-19 and was put on the injured list earlier in the day. The dynamic shortstop was joined by utility players Jurickson Profar and Jorge Mateo, who were sidelined prior to the series opener as part of Major League Baseball's contact tracing health and safety protocols. Myers knocked into the right-field wall in the first inning while catching Garrett Hampson’s deep flyball. Myers appeared to be shaken up on the play and was checked by team trainers, and remained in the game. But in the third, he was replaced in right field by Tucupita Marcano. While he did bang his elbow on the play, Myers was removed when the team learned he had tested positive for the virus, Tingler said. Hosmer was subbed out of first base in the seventh for contact tracing. “It’s a bummer,” Machado said. “It definitely has been a down day. It’s unfortunate, the situation that is going on.” “We have a great group of guys in there, who step in for each other. We had guys who flew in and stepped up big time for us today,” he said. It was Colorado's sixth straight loss to San Diego dating to Aug. 30, 2020. They have been outscored 47-11 in that span. Down 1-0 in the fifth, the Padres went ahead when Machado followed Jake Croneworth’s double with a drive off Antonio Senzatela (1-4) that soared into the left-field bleachers. Machado’s two-out, bases-loaded triple off Tyler Kinley was part of San Diego’s six-run sixth that also included Austin Nola’s sacrifice fly, Ha-Seong Kim’s run-scoring fielder’s choice and Hosmer’s RBI single. The Padres employed a pitching by committee approach ahead of Wednesday’s doubleheader at Colorado. Dinelson Lamet went the first two innings and allowed one run on one hit. Miguel Diaz (1-0) earned the win with three innings of scoreless relief. Senzatela made his first start since coming off the injured list earlier in the day because of a groin strain. “It’s good to have him back,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “His arm felt good, just felt fine. So, you know, we didn’t have much of a sixth (inning) but he kept us in the game through five.” TRAINER’S ROOM Padres: With Tatis, Profar and Mateo placed on the injured list, INF/OF Tucupita Marcano and RHP Nabil Crismatt were recalled from Triple-A El Paso and selected OF John Andreoli to the roster. Rockies: 1B C.J. Cron has been placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to last Friday, with a lower back strain. Senzatela was activated from the IL prior to the game, returning from a right groin strain. UP NEXT The Padres and Rockies are slated to play a doubleheader Wednesday, with the second game a makeup for Monday’s rainout. RHP Jon Gray (4-2, 3.12 ERA) is scheduled to start the first game for the Rockies against San Diego’s Yu Darvish (3-1, 2.27 ERA). LHP Austin Gomber (2-4, 6.35 ERA) is set to start the second game for the Rockies against LHP Blake Snell (1-0, 4.15 ERA). ___ More AP MLB:  and _Sports Dennis Georgatos, The Associated Press","['play', 'rockies', 'reversed', 'guys', 'riksbank', 'auctions', 'conditions', 'myers', 'injured', 'going', 'list', 'padres', 'bonds', 'san', 'sek', 'game']",2021-05-07,ca.sports.yahoo.com,Euroclear

The weakened occupancy rate can be attributed largely to the general uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the increased offering of rental housing, and decreased willingness of customers to promote us all of which increased the tenant turnover.In accordance with our Customer First development programme, we focused on adapting our organisation and our service processes to respond to our customers’ needs even better. SATO’s own House Experts are a presence in the day-to-day lives of more than 13,000 residents in the Helsinki metropolitan area. During the end of the year 2019 SATO launched a maintenance model where its own building superintendents, SATO House Experts, took on some of the duties of SATO’s maintenance partners.In order to maintain profitability, the company has streamlined its sales and marketing measures and focused on cost-efficiency improvements.Construction was started on the Wise Mobility City Block in Helsinki’s Oulunkylä district during the review period.Once again, I wish to thank SATO employees for their commendable work and for doing everything they could to ensure the comfort of our residents, also during this uncertain and challenging time.Operating environmentStory continuesThe recovery of Finland’s economy from the Covid-19 crisis will be slow in the beginning of the year, but economic growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the vaccination rate increases and the relieving of restrictions can begin. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland in March, Finland’s economy will grow 2.6 per cent in 2021. The projection forecasts that economic recovery will continue in 2022. The evolution of the coronavirus situation will continue to spawn major uncertainty with regard to economic development.Efforts are being made to limit the negative impact of the pandemic on Finland’s economy through support measures adopted by the European Central Bank, the European Union and the State of Finland.The pandemic has slightly shifted the focus of demand for rental apartments to larger apartments and areas with lower rent levels. Behind both of these developments is the increase in teleworking: people need more space when they also use their home for working.In recent years, the rental housing markets in major cities have been characterised by sharp growth in supply. The growth largely stems from the brisk production of rental housing.As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, previously short-term rental apartments were offered for longer rental periods, which boosted supply in some cities, even to a considerable degree. However, demand for rental apartments was partly negatively affected by upper secondary schools and universities switching to remote teaching.Despite the coronavirus pandemic that erupted in 2020, there is demand for rental apartments, and the urbanisation trend continues to be strong.REVIEW PERIOD 1 January–31 March 2021 (1 January–31 March 2020)Net sales and profitBetween January and March 2021, consolidated net sales were EUR 74.0 (75.6) million.Operating profit was EUR 67.9 (45.5) million.

Equity was EUR 2,179.0 (2,081.3) million. Equity per share was EUR 38.49 (36.76).The Group’s equity ratio was 43.8 (43.3) per cent at the end of March. EUR 0.0 million in new long-term financing was withdrawn and the solvency ratio was 43.4 (44.0) per cent at the end of March.The Group’s annualised return on equity was 8.2 (5.2) per cent. Return on invested capital was 6.1 (4.3) per cent.Interest-bearing liabilities at the end of March totalled EUR 2,200.9 (2,135.0) million, of which loans subject to market terms accounted for EUR 1,995.1 (1,874.0) million.

Net financing costs totalled EUR -11.8 (-11.0) million.The calculated impact of changes in the market value of interest hedging on equity was EUR 6.8 (-1.6) million.The proportion of loans without asset-based securities was 82.5 (78.3) per cent of all loans. At the end of March, the proportion of unencumbered assets was 84.1 (82.2) per cent of total assets.Housing businessOur housing business includes rental activities, customer service, lifecycle management and maintenance. Effective rental activities and digital services provide home-seekers with quick access to a home, and the Group with a steadily increasing cash flow. High-quality maintenance operations ensure the comfort of residents and that the apartments stay in good condition and maintain their value. We serve our customers in daily housing issues through our customer-oriented service organisation.Rental income was EUR 74.0 (75.6) million. The economic occupancy rate of apartments in Finland was 94.8 (97.6) per cent on average, and the external tenant turnover was 31.6 (28.1) per cent.The average monthly rent of SATO’s rental apartments in Finland at the end of the review period was EUR 17.50 (17.28) per m2.Net rental income from apartments stood at EUR 44.9 (47.0) million.Investment propertiesOn 31 March 2021, SATO owned a total of 26,714 (26,380) apartments. Altogether 0 (211) rental apartments were completed during the review period. The total number of divested rental apartments and shared ownership apartments redeemed by the owner-occupants was 5.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. Its housing stock is concentrated in areas and apartment sizes which are expected to be the focus, in the long term, of increasing rental apartment demand. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.At the end of March, the fair value of investment properties came to a total of EUR 4,804.5 (4,689.1) million. The change in the value of investment properties, including the rental apartments acquired and divested during the review period, was EUR 51.0 (31.2) million.Of the value of apartments, the Helsinki metropolitan area accounted for some 85 per cent, Tampere and Turku made up 11 per cent, Jyväskylä and Oulu 2 per cent and St. Petersburg covered 2 per cent at the end of March.Investments, divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. Since 2000, SATO has invested more than EUR 2.0 billion in non-subsidised rental apartments. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments stood at EUR 16.9 (27.3) million. Investments in the Helsinki metropolitan area represented 92 per cent of all investments in the review period. Investments in new apartments represented 40.8 per cent of the investments. On 31 March 2021, binding purchase agreements in Finland totalled EUR 76.8 (42.0) million.During the period under review, construction was begun on the Wise Mobility City Block planned by SATO and located in Helsinki’s Oulunkylä district on Maaherrantie. The block, located at the junction of the Raide-Jokeri tramline and the main railway, will see the construction of altogether around 500 rental, owner-occupied and part ownership apartments over the next few years. Construction work will begin with three apartment buildings, consisting of altogether 222 rental homes of different sizes. The property will be completed in spring 2023. Geothermal heating was chosen as the heat source, which will reduce CO 2 emissions. A further benefit of geothermal heating is that it can also be used to cool the building. A solar power system producing renewable energy is also in the works for the property. All of the parking spaces will be equipped for charging electric vehicles. The buildings will be carbon neutral in terms of in-use energy, when renewable electricity is used alongside geothermal heating. Later, a SATO FlexHome will also be erected on the block. FlexHome is a short-term ownership concept that enables home ownership with a small initial capital outlay and a five-year part-ownership period.During the review period, 5 (56) rental apartments were divested in Finland. Their total value was EUR 0.9 (2.4) million.The book value of plot reserves totalled EUR 67.1 (57.1) million at the end of March. The value of new plots acquired by the end of March totalled EUR 4.4 (1.8) million.The permitted building volume for about 2,150 apartments is being developed for the plots in the company’s housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure, create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.In Finland, 0 (211) rental and 0 (0) owner-occupied apartments were completed. On 31 March 2021, a total of 561 (848) rental apartments and 71 (115) owner-occupied apartments were under construction.A total of EUR 14.0 (15.9) million was spent on repairing apartments and improving their quality.At the end of March, SATO owned 533 (533) apartments in St. Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental apartments in St. Petersburg was 95.0 (91.1) per cent on average. For the time being, SATO will refrain from making new investment decisions in Russia. The share of investments in Russia is limited to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Group’s housing assets.PersonnelAt the end of March, the Group employed 249 (224) people, of whom 234 (211) had a permanent employment contract.

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The most significant risk in the immediate future is the coronavirus pandemic, whose duration and impact on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. A prolonged pandemic may have a major negative impact on economic growth, and on business activity, employment and work productivity in Finland. Such economic or business deterioration, as well as quarantines or other restrictive measures, may have an adverse impact on the financial result or operations of SATO’s properties, not to mention on financing costs or values.The most significant risks in the renting of apartments are related to economic cycles and fluctuations in demand. A clear weakening in the housing market could have a negative impact on the market value of SATO’s housing portfolio. In accordance with its strategy, SATO focuses its investments on growth centres, thus ensuring the rental potential of its apartments and the development of their value.Changes in official regulations and legislation, as well as the uncertainty stemming from them, may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and thus on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy approved by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity, refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio, and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets, a bank account limit, committed credit facilities, and a commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by issuing fixed rate loans or by interest rate hedges. At the end of the review period, the share of fixed rate loans of the debt portfolio was 70.9 per cent.There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations, including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk. Possibilities of hedging the translation risk are evaluated in accordance with our treasury policy. For the time being, SATO will refrain from making new investments in Russia.A more detailed description of risks and risk management is available in the Group’s annual report for 2020 and on the website www.sato.fi.OutlookIn the operating environment, SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence, the development of purchasing power, rent and price development for apartments, the general competitive situation and interest rates.The Covid-19 pandemic that started in early 2020 has had a major impact on the Finnish economy. In early 2021, the recovery of Finland’s economy will be slow due to the weakened pandemic situation, but economic growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the vaccination rate increases and the relieving of restrictions can begin. According to the projection made by the Bank of Finland in March, Finland’s economy will grow 2.6 per cent in 2021. The projection forecasts that economic recovery will continue in 2022. The evolution of the coronavirus situation and delays in vaccinations will continue to spawn major uncertainty with regard to economic development.Efforts are being made to limit the negative impact of the pandemic on Finland’s economy through support measures adopted by the European Central Bank, the European Union and the State of Finland. Due to Europe’s weak economic development, interest rates are expected to remain low for a longer time, which will have a positive impact on SATO’s financing costs.In recent years, the rental housing markets in major cities have been characterised by sharp growth in supply. The growth largely stems from the brisk production of rental housing. Due to the low interest rate level and strong investor demand, the rate of housing construction is expected to remain at a high level.During the Covid-19 pandemic, previously short-term rental apartments were offered for longer rental periods, which boosted supply in some cities, even to a considerable degree. However, demand for rental apartments was partly negatively affected by upper secondary schools and universities switching to remote teaching. Once the restrictions to contain the spread of the coronavirus have been relieved, travel rates increase and students return to classrooms, the demand for rental apartments is expected to start growing.As a consequence of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, SATO’s external tenant turnover has grown and the economic occupancy rate weakened compared to the previous year. In order to maintain profitability, the company has streamlined its sales and marketing measures and focused on cost-efficiency improvement measures. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its customer presence and developing digital services. These measures are expected to have a positive impact on the occupancy rate in the medium term.SATO Corporation’s shareholders on 31 March 2021Largest shareholders and their holdingsno. of shares % Balder Finska Otas Ab (Fastighets Ab Balder)31,696,745 55.8% Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool12,811,647 22.6% Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company7,233,081 12.7% The State Pension Fund2,796,200 4.9% Valkila Erkka390,000 0.7% Hengityssairauksien tutkimussäätiö227,000 0.4% SATO Corporation160,000 0.3% Entelä Tuula159,000 0.3% Heinonen Erkki 156,684 0.3% Tradeka-invest Ltd 126,500 0.2% Others (110 shareholders) 1,020,210 1.8%On 31 March 2021, SATO had 56,783,067 shares and 120 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

Profit before taxes for January – March 2021 rose to EUR 632 million (162) and earnings per share increased to EUR 0.82 (0.26). Mark-to-market earnings per share saw a positive year-on-year increase of more than three euros per share to EUR 1.39 (-1.71).Sampo Group’s core business, P&C insurance, reported the strongest underwriting results in its history. Group underwriting profits grew by 37 per cent year-on-year to EUR 317 million driven by a 4.5 percentage point improvement in the combined ratio to 81.2 per cent (85.7). The result represents a strong first step towards Sampo’s annual financial targets of mid-single digit growth in underwriting profits and a combined ratio below 86 per cent. COVID-19 effects supported underwriting margins but underlying development was nonetheless strong.The Group’s largest business unit, If P&C, reported underwriting profit of EUR 213 million with growth of 18 per cent year-on-year and a combined ratio of 81.5 per cent, both of which are the best-ever recorded in a first quarter. Following the strong performance in the quarter, If’s 2021 combined ratio outlook has been improved to 82 - 84 per cent, well in line with the target of below 85 per cent. Favourable investment markets further supported earnings, leading profit before taxes to almost double to EUR 257 million (129).Topdanmark’s profit before taxes for January-March 2021 amounted to EUR 137 million (-13) in Sampo Group’s consolidated accounts. The combined ratio improved to 84.7 per cent (88.7).Hastings achieved strong underwriting margins in the first quarter of 2021, supported by lower claims frequencies as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and the ongoing progress on strategic and operational initiatives. Hastings’ operating ratio for the first quarter was 75.1 per cent and the profit before taxes was EUR 46 million. Pressure on UK motor pricing led Hastings to take a disciplined underwriting approach, as a result of which the number of live customer policies remained stable over the quarter at 3.1 million (7 per cent growth year-on-year).Story continuesThe profit before taxes for Mandatum in January – March 2021 amounted to EUR 76 million (-16). Benign investment markets drove a strong mark-to-market investment return of 3.5 per cent and a rise in the Solvency II ratio to 200 per cent (188). Unit linked assets under management increased to EUR 9.2 billion. A reduction in the discount rate for with-profit liabilities had a negative impact of EUR 31 million in the quarter, while with-profit reserves relating to the higher guarantees (4.5 and 3.5 per cent) decreased to EUR 1.8 billion (1.9).Sampo’s share of Nordea’s net profit for the first quarter of 2021 was EUR 121 million (84).The Group Solvency II ratio of 189 per cent stood within the target range of 170 – 190 per cent, while Group financial leverage ratio of 28 per cent met the target of below 30 per cent.Return on equity for the Group amounted to 26.0 per cent (-33.2) for the first quarter of 2021.

The Interim Statement is also available at www.sampo.com/result.GROUP CEO’S COMMENTSampo delivered strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, particularly in our strategic focus area of P&C insurance. The Group outperformed its primary financial targets, reporting underwriting profit growth of 37 per cent and a combined ratio of 81.2 per cent (85.7).Our largest business unit, If P&C, delivered an excellent result despite some wintry Nordic weather. Underwriting profit grew by 18 per cent to EUR 213 million on the back of a 2.2 percentage points year-on-year improvement in the combined ratio to 81.5 per cent (83.7). This is If P&C’s best-ever first quarter combined ratio and well within our annual target for 2021-2023 of below 85 per cent. Consequently, we have improved our outlook for 2021 to 82 – 84 per cent. Adjusting for COVID-19 effects and harsher winter weather, underwriting profit growth clearly supported the mid-single digit target for 2021-2023.Operationally, If P&C continued to benefit from the investments made in IT development, which enable excellent customer service, risk selection and cost efficiency. Customer satisfaction in If Private increased over the quarter and retention remained high. If P&C also benefitted from its strong Nordic partnership network, taking a leading share in a new car market that grew by 11 per cent year-on-year.Our digital UK P&C insurance business, Hastings, also outperformed its targets on loss ratio and operating ratio in the first quarter of 2021. The result was partly attributable to the UK lockdown, which led to low motor claims frequencies, but at the same time pricing trends have become more challenging. Hastings is taking a disciplined approach in the current market, keeping motor insurance customer count broadly stable over the quarter (7 per cent growth year-on-year). The strength of Hastings’ business model, combined with ongoing operational improvements, gives me confidence in its ability to deliver growth at attractive margins over the medium term.The integration of Hastings into Sampo has proceeded according to plan in the first quarter. A number of specific areas have been identified for knowledge transfer that are expected to bring concrete operational benefits to both If and Hastings. The group will continuously update the market on progress.Sampo was well placed to profit from the buoyant capital markets environment in the first quarter of 2021. Our 15.9 per cent investment in Nordea benefitted from higher interest rates and improved sentiment toward banks; combined with robust operational performance, this drove a share price increase of 26 per cent over the quarter. The environment also favoured Mandatum Life, which saw a rise in its Solvency II ratio to 200 per cent and strong growth in unit-linked assets under management.Turning to ESG, I am pleased to report that Sampo has taken another step in the right direction with an upgrade from Sustainalytics to Low Risk. Sampo is now in the top five of the 71 insurers rated by Sustainalytics and the highest rated insurer with a market cap of EUR 20 – 40 billion. Nonetheless, I see room to further improve our ESG performance and feel it is important to continue to develop opportunities in this area.At our February Capital Markets Day, my colleagues and I laid out Sampo’s new, P&C-focussed strategy and financial targets, placing underwriting profitability at the core of our ambitions. The first quarter has represented a solid first step in executing against these objectives. Given our strong positioning and business plan, I feel confident about the Group’s trajectory in 2021 and beyond.Torbjörn MagnussonGroup CEO and PresidentOUTLOOKOutlook for 2021Sampo Group’s insurance businesses are expected to report good insurance technical results for 2021, although the mark-to-market component of investment returns will be significantly influenced by capital markets’ developments, particularly in life insurance.If P&C is expected to reach a combined ratio of 82 - 84 per cent in 2021.With regard to Topdanmark, reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.Hastings is on track to deliver against its financial targets but uncertainties relating to COVID-19 development, regulatory reform and Brexit remain.Nordea continues to focus on creating great customer experiences, growing income and improving operational efficiency. The results are progressing well towards 2022 targets.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties, mainly through its separately managed major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies’ profitability and its variation are market, credit, insurance and operational risks that are quantified independently by the major business units. At the group level, sources of risks are the same, although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group’s profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities, timing, and potential outcomes. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain the virus are causing significant uncertainties on economic and capital market development. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic, political and other sources of uncertainty which can, in various ways, affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group’s business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes, sustainability issues, and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalization including threats posed by cybercrime.THE BOARD’S DIVIDEND PROPOSALThe Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of EUR 1.70 per share to the company’s 555,351,850 shares. The dividends to be paid are EUR 944,098,145.00 in total. The remainder of the funds are left in the equity.The dividend will be paid to the shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Ltd as the record date of 21 May 2021. The Board proposes that the dividend be paid on 28 May 2021.EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ON SAMPO GROUPThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect societies, businesses and individual people during the first quarter of 2021. However, as a technologically advanced insurance group, Sampo has been able to meet the challenges created by COVID-19 and to accelerate support and services, both for its customers and for its employees.There have been no COVID-19 related lay-offs among Sampo Group personnel and none of the Group companies has required any government funding support during the COVID-19 pandemic.If’s claims cost for the first quarter was positively impacted by low claims frequency, especially in motor and travel insurance, following from continued lockdown measures implemented by governments to contain the spread of the pandemic and a low level of activity in society. The effect of COVID-19 on If’s risk ratio is approximately 3 percentage points positive in the first quarter. Claims frequency levels are expected to increase towards more normal levels following the improved situation and as a consequence of lockdown measures.Hastings’ motor claims frequencies have reduced, reflecting reduced motor vehicle usage as a result of the national and local restrictions resulting from COVID-19 which continued throughout most of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Claim severities increased due to interruptions in the repair networks and supply of parts caused by COVID-19 and increased car rental costs, with repairs typically taking longer than anticipated.Topdanmark has reported on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in its interim report for January–March 2021 published on 26 April 2021. The report is available at www.topdanmark.com.BUSINESS AREASIfThe underwriting result for the If segment of EUR 213 million was the best-ever recorded in a first quarter, as was the combined ratio of 81.5 per cent. Weather losses were slightly above the normal and large losses were broadly at normal levels while COVID-19 loss frequency effects benefitted the combined ratio by approximately 3 percentage points. Prior year development had a 4 percentage points positive impact on the combined ratio, which is within the range of outcomes observed over recent years. Following the strong performance in the quarter, If’s 2021 combined ratio outlook has been improved to 82 – 84 per cent, well in line with the target of below 85 per cent.The underwriting result of EUR 213 million (180) represented 18 per cent growth over the previous year. Adjusting for COVID-19 effects and harsher winter weather, underwriting profit growth clearly supported the mid-single digit target for 2021-2023.The first quarter combined ratio of 81.5 per cent was 2.2 percentage points better than the year before (83.7) mainly as a result of an improvement in the risk ratio to 61.0 per cent (63.4). The combined ratio benefitted from rating actions, particularly in BA Industrial and BA Commercial, as well as ongoing operational work on risk selection and cost efficiency.Large claims declined year-on-year, supporting risk ratio development by approximately 1.8 percentage points. Weather conditions were roughly 2 percentage points harsher than in the previous year with cold temperatures and snowfall leading to freeze claims. COVID-effects supported year-on-year development in the risk ratio by approximately 3 percentage points.In the first quarter of 2021 EUR 47 million (62) was released from the technical reserves relating to prior year claims. The reserve releases had a positive impact of 4 percentage points on the combined ratio, which was 1.6 percentage points less than a year ago.The cost ratio was stable relative to the previous year at 20.5 per cent (20.4).Gross written premiums amounted to EUR 1,801 million (1,733) in January – March 2021. Excluding the currency effects, premiums grew 2.6 per cent (7.0), driven by stable and high retention levels and strong business momentum. The renewals of corporate lines on 1 January 2021 were characterised by stable retention and selective rate actions.If’s most profitable business, BA Private, was the main driver of growth but premiums grew in all business areas. Geographically, Sweden and Norway saw growth; in Sweden, new car sales had a notable positive impact on premium growth. COVID-19 has a negative impact on premium volumes in the Finnish workers compensation and the travel insurance portfolio across all markets. The growth in the Baltics was significantly stronger than the market average.If reported a strong investment result of EUR 52 million driven by highly supportive equity and credit markets. Mark-to-market return on investments increased to 1.5 per cent (-5.6). Asset allocation remained stable. Fixed income comprises 88 per cent (88) and equity 12 per cent (12) of the total assets of EUR 11.6 billion (11.0).As a result of the strong underwriting result and investment income achieved in the first quarter, profit before taxes almost doubled to EUR 257 (129) million relative to the difficult first quarter of 2020. Total comprehensive income for the period after tax was EUR 292 million (-518).If’s solvency position is described in the section Solvency.TopdanmarkAt the end of March 2021 Sampo plc held 41,997,070 Topdanmark shares, corresponding to 46.7 per cent of all shares and 47,9 per cent of related voting rights in the company. The market value of the holding was EUR 1,639 million on 31 March 2021.Topdanmark’s profit before taxes for January-March 2021 amounted in Sampo Group’s profit and loss account to EUR 137 million (-13). The combined ratio improved to 84.7 per cent (88.7). The expense ratio was 16.8 per cent (17.2).Further information on Topdanmark A/S and its January-March 2021 result is available at www.topdanmark.com.HastingsHastings achieved strong underwriting margins in the first quarter of 2021, supported by lower claims frequencies as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and the ongoing progress on strategic and operational initiatives.Gross written premiums amounted to EUR 238 million, with lower average premiums than previously recorded, primarily reflecting lower claims frequencies, a competitive pricing environment and a change in mix of customers to lower risk segments, as well as the ongoing support given to Hastings’ customers.Rate reduction has been observed across the UK motor market during the first quarter of 2021. Hastings has remained disciplined in its pricing approach, resulting in live customer policies being broadly stable compared to the year end at 3.1 million, and up 7 per cent year-on-year. Customer retention rates continue to be high and above market averages.Motor claims frequencies have remained low, reflecting reduced motor vehicle usage as a result of COVID-19 restrictions that continued throughout most of the first quarter of 2021. Uncertainty over ultimate costs has been recognized in a continued cautious approach to reserving.Hastings operating ratio for the first quarter was 75.1 per cent. The ratio includes a 3.4 percentage points benefit from acquisition accounting across revenue and operating expenses for deferred acquisition costs and other fair value adjustments that will continue until the end of 2021.Hastings segment’s profit before taxes for January – March 2021 amounted to 46 million. This includes a EUR 10 million charge for amortization of non-operational intangibles, which will continue for the next seven years.Hastings continues to make good progress on its strategic initiatives, including digital capabilities. More customers are choosing to make contact through the mobile app and customer engagement and feedback on the app remains positive. Claims transformation initiatives, spanning accidental damage, third party property damage and bodily injury, also continue to make good progress. Home insurance customer policies were up 28 per cent year-on-year.Colleague engagement remains very positive. Investment continues to be made in home and flexible working, which Hastings intends to continue beyond COVID-19, to ensure the training and development and wellbeing of Colleagues, as well as on the diversity and inclusion agenda, including a focus on the progression of women into senior roles.Whiplash reforms, designed to reduce the cost of small bodily injury claims, will come into effect across the UK market at the end of May. In addition, the final report of the FCA’s general insurance pricing practices market study is also expected in May, with full implementation required by the end of December 2021. Hastings remains supportive of both reforms and its agile pricing, superior risk selection and business model means that it is well positioned to adapt and become a net beneficiary versus competitors over time.MandatumThe profit before taxes for Mandatum Group in January – March 2021 amounted to EUR 76 million (-16). The result benefitted from favorable investment markets, which supported net investment income of EUR 105 million (-23), excluding income on unit-linked contracts. The net income from unit-linked contracts was EUR 375 million (-884). The total comprehensive income for the period after tax reflecting the changes in market value of assets, was EUR 108 million (-323).Mandatum Life’s total technical reserves increased to EUR 12.7 billion (12.3). The increase was driven by unit-linked reserves, which grew to EUR 9.2 billion (8.8) at the end of March on the back of good momentum in the capital markets. Mandatum’s expense result was EUR 8 million (6) and the risk result stood at EUR 6 million (5).The with-profit reserves related to the higher guarantees of 4.5 and 3.5 per cent decreased by EUR 50 million to EUR 1.8 billion (1.9) at the end of March 2021. In total, with-profit reserves equaled EUR 3.4 billion (3.5).Mandatum Life’s discount rate for 2024 was lowered to 1.5 per cent, which had a negative impact of EUR 31 million on the result.

In this calculation Nordea is treated as an equity investment.On 24 February 2021 Sampo published a target for its Group solvency ratio. Sampo targets a solvency ratio between 170 and 190 per cent according to the Solvency II rules. On 31 March 2021 Sampo Group’s solvency ratio was at the upper end of the target range and amounted to 189 per cent (176).Solvency position in the subsidiariesThe insurance subsidiaries apply Solvency II rules in their regulatory solvency calculations. If Group companies use either partial internal models or standard model for calculation of their solo solvency position. Mandatum Life reports in accordance with standard formula for Solvency II. Topdanmark uses a partial internal model to report its stand-alone solvency position.Hastings is fully consolidated into the Sampo Group’s Own funds and SCR. As a stand-alone entity AICL, Hastings underwriting company, calculates its solo solvency position according to Solvency II rules.If Group has an A+ rating from S&P which will continue to require significantly more capital than the standard formula and therefore the use of standard formula has no practical implications on If Group’s capital position. On 31 March 2021 If Group’s Solvency II capital requirement under standard formula amounted to EUR 2,020 million (1,916) and own funds to EUR 4,289 million (3,623). The solvency ratio amounted to 212 per cent (189).The S&P A+ rating capital requirement for If Group amounted to EUR 3,081 million (3,083) on 31 March 2021 and the capital base was EUR 3,732 million (3,234).Topdanmark calculates most of its non-life and health risks and their respective solvency capital requirement by applying a partial internal model approved by the DFSA. Other risks are calculated by the Solvency II SCR standard formula. During the first quarter of 2021, Topdanmark has updated its model apparatus for calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and the own funds in life insurance. Topdanmark’s solvency ratio under the partial internal model rose to 243 per cent (170) at the end of March 2021.Mandatum Group’s solvency ratio amounted to 204 per cent on 31 March 2021. The life company in the Group, Mandatum Life, had a solvency ratio of 200 per cent (188). Its Own funds were EUR 2,491 million (2,308) and the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) was EUR 1,243 million (1,230). Without transitional measures the solvency ratio was 173 per cent (159).Leverage positionOn 24 February 2021 Sampo published a target of below 30 per cent for its Group leverage ratio calculated as Group’s financial debt divided by the sum of IFRS equity and financial debt. Leverage ratio was 28 per cent on 31 March 2021. Group’s financial debt amounted EUR 5,060 million and the IFRS equity was EUR 12,979 million.Sampo plc’s debt financing on 31 March 2021 amounted to EUR 3,932 million (3,934) and interest-bearing assets to EUR 1,839 million (1,529). Financial liabilities consisted of issued senior bonds and notes of EUR 2,446 million (2,448) and of subordinated notes of EUR 1,486 million (1,486). No CPs were outstanding (0). The average interest, net of interest rate swaps, on Sampo plc’s debt as of 31 March 2021 was 1.7 per cent (1.6). At the end of March 2021, the interest-bearing net debt of Sampo plc amounted to EUR 2,093 million (2,405).More information on Sampo Group’s outstanding debt issues is available at www.sampo.com/debtfinancing.SAMPO PLCBoard of DirectorsFor more information, please contact:Knut Arne Alsaker, Group CFO, tel. +358 10 516 0010Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations and Group Communications, tel. +358 10 516 0030Maria Silander, Communications Manager, Media Relations, tel. +358 10 516 0031Conference callAn English-language conference call for investors and analysts will be arranged at 4 pm Finnish time (2 pm UK time).

The impact of the change in working capital was EUR -7.2 (3.8) million.In March, Aspo’s Board of Directors appointed Rolf Jansson Aspo’s new CEO. He will take the helm from Aki Ojanen, who will retire from his position. Jansson will start as the new CEO at the beginning of October at the latest.Heikki Westerlund started as the new Chairman of Aspo’s Board of Directors on April 8, 2021. He replaced Gustav Nyberg, Chairman of Aspo’s Board of Directors since 2009 and Aspo Group’s CEO before that, who announced earlier that he will no longer be available as a member of Aspo’s Board of Directors at the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.Aspo will pay EUR 0.35 per share in dividends for the 2020 financial year.

The Group’s operating profit reached a new record of EUR 7.9 (4.0) million during the first quarter. This significant increase in the operating profit resulted from Telko’s considerably improved profitability, with ESL Shipping’s Q1 results also being the strongest in its history.Our potential to achieve our financial targets set for 2023 was already reflected strongly in our first quarter’s figures. Our operating profit rate increased to the targeted 6%, our return on equity exceeded the target of 20% and gearing continued to decrease towards the targeted 130%. This trend results from correct choices and the unrelenting fulfillment of our strategy in our businesses.ESL Shipping is within the scope of tonnage taxation, which is why Aspo’s tax efficiency has improved, driven by the shipping company’s improved results. Aspo’s earnings per share during the first quarter were EUR 0.19, which can be regarded as an excellent start to 2021. Now that the most significant financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are starting to ease off, Aspo’s operating profit for the previous six months has increased to EUR 15.5 (9.4) million, which is a clear indication of our conglomerate’s strong ability to overcome crises and to recover quickly, and also of our profit-making potential. The Group’s previous significant investments and business transactions also enable our strong development in the future.The market situation continued to improve during the first quarter. The rapid recovery of international markets has raised raw material prices unusually quickly and even resulted in problems with availability. Shipping freight rates, important for Aspo, have improved, and especially the freight rates of the largest vessel category have recovered to a good level. However, the future development of prices and the availability of raw materials are still difficult to predict at present regarding the fall and the rest of the year.Even though markets have already started to recover, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic can still be seen strongly in many of our operating countries. During the first quarter, movement restrictions increased particularly in the Baltic and Finnish markets. In Scandinavia, the situation has largely remained unchanged, while restrictions and lockdowns have been lifted in Russia and eastern markets. We succeeded well in eastern markets, with profitability improving even further in the market area. Eastern markets continue to be a strategically important market area and a source of organic growth for Aspo.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsWith its current structure, Aspo targets an operating profit rate of 6%, return on equity (ROE) of more than 20% on average and gearing of at most 130%. Aspo aims to reach the financial targets set in 2023.The operating profit rate increased during the first quarter of 2021 to 6.0% (3.0%). Return on equity improved significantly, being 21.8% (3/2020: 8.7%). Gearing continued to decrease, being 139.0% (12/2020: 149.0%).At the end of 2020, Aspo’s Board of Directors defined a new long-term sustainability target, according to which the businesses Aspo owns will be forerunners in sustainability in their respective fields. Work to set new business-specific sustainability targets is in progress, and these will be announced during the second half of the year. Aspo Group’s 2020 sustainability report was published in March and ESL Shipping’s sustainability report was published in April, both of which are available on the companies’ websites.Operating environmentThe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the operating environment has decreased quickly, and economies have started to recover in Aspo’s market areas. The operating environment quickly became challenging and difficult to foresee due to the coronavirus pandemic. When the pandemic was at its worst, the real economy’s impact on exchange rates reduced net sales, and some currencies have continued to decrease, including the Russian ruble. Furthermore, slower and partially empty industrial supply chains have also had an impact on demand for logistics services, which has still turned to growth. Furthermore, it is still difficult to estimate how long the coronavirus pandemic continues to have an impact on business operations, with related movement and financial restrictions. Geopolitical tensions have remained unchanged from a business point of view.Net sales by market area 1-3/2021 Share 1-3/2020 Share Change MEUR % MEUR % % Finland 45.3 34 46.5 35 -3 Scandinavia 24.7 19 20.7 16 19 Baltic countries 12.0 9 11.5 9 4 Russia, other CIS countries and Ukraine 35.0 26 37.4 28 -6 Other countries 15.3 12 17.1 13 -11 Total 132.3 100 133.2 100 -1The Group’s main market areas are Finland, Scandinavia, the Baltic countries, and eastern markets (Russia, other CIS countries, and Ukraine). Net sales reached the comparative period’s level, even though there were changes between market areas. The increase in net sales in Scandinavia was driven by the growing transportation volumes in the steel industry. There were no significant changes in other market areas.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 6.6 (13.9) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -7.2 (3.8) million, mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable. As a result of low investment level, the Group’s free cash flow during the first quarter amounted to EUR 5.1 (13.3) million.3/2021 3/2020 12/2020 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities 197.6 214.6 201.4 Cash and cash equivalents 29.9 27.0 32.3 Net interest-bearing debt 167.7 187.6 169.1Net interest-bearing liabilities decreased to EUR 167.7 million and gearing fell to 139.0% (3/2020: EUR 158.5 million, 12/2020: 149.0%), approaching the Group’s long-term target of 130%. The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 31.1% (3/2020: 29.9%, 12/2020: 30.1%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -0.9 (-1.1) million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities, was 1.5% (1.5%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 29.9 million at the end of the review period (12/2020: EUR 32.3 million). Committed revolving credit facilities, totaling EUR 55.0 million, were fully unused, as in the comparative period. Of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program EUR 8 million was in use (3/2020: EUR 18 million, 12/2020: EUR 11 million).Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsThe coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken to prevent coronavirus from spreading, both of which affect consumers, trade, industries and social structures, comprise the most significant short-term risk for Aspo’s businesses and demand for their products and services. Geopolitical tensions have also increased risks in Aspo’s eastern market areas, and preparations for them have been started.Lockdowns imposed in many countries, uncertainties over the duration of the pandemic, as well as new and recurrent infected areas, combined with virus mutations, the ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties have an impact on the production decisions and logistics arrangements of Aspo’s largest customers. Disturbances in supply chains resulting from the pandemic present a risk to Aspo’s all businesses. The accumulation of shipping containers at transportation destinations, the availability of raw materials, and, most recently, the shortage of electronics components have slowed down the recovery of economies in general and decelerated the growth of Aspo’s businesses. Fluctuations in demand for transportation services and restrictions on movement have a general impact on the income of shipping companies, which may also affect Aspo’s results and cash flow. There may be corresponding effects in Aspo’s all business segments, as customers’ production cuts potentially reduce demand, even though the pandemic has had less impact on Aspo’s business operations and results than what was initially suspected.Restrictions on movement may affect the shipping company’s operations and decelerate deliveries in other business segments. Aspo’s results and balance sheet structure may weaken as a result of slowdown in economic activities, fluctuations in exchange rates and any restrictions on financing. The pandemic may have far-reaching consequences and a long-term impact on the operating environment, which may present a strategic risk to Aspo.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping's operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period, the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 52 vessels with a total capacity of 477,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these, 24 were wholly owned (73% of the tonnage), two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 26 vessels (25%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round, even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2021 1-3/2020 Change,% Net sales, MEUR 43.4 42.7 1.6 Operating profit, MEUR 4.5 2.3 95.7 Operating profit, % 10.4 5.4ESL Shipping had a historically strong first quarter, with its operating profit nearly doubling from the previous year to EUR 4.5 (2.3) million. The operating profit rate of 10.4% (5.4) was good for winter, regardless of the ice conditions being more challenging than during the comparative period. The transportation volumes of the shipping company were at the comparative period’s level at 3.5 (3.5) million tons. Net sales increased slightly from the comparative period and stood at EUR 43.4 (42.7) million.ESL Shipping’s capacity was almost fully in use during the review period. Demand and transportation volumes among all ESL Shipping’s main customers remained at the estimated strong level during the first quarter, apart from the energy industry where coal transportation volumes decreased in Finland and Central Europe. During the review period, coal consumed for energy only accounted for less than 5% of the shipping company’s total transportation volume. Demand for loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea was high during the review period.The shipping company’s Supramax vessels traveled longer distances than during the comparative period, which reduced transportation volumes. The international cargo market of these vessels was stronger than during the comparative period, and the vessels’ profitability increased significantly. Furthermore, the cargo price level of smaller vessels improved from the comparative period.Operations of ESL Shipping’s largest vessel categories were successful, despite the highly demanding weather and ice conditions. Ports have been very congested in the shipping company’s main transportation areas due to increased traffic volumes and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the availability of stevedores. In the smaller vessel category, the more difficult ice situation than in the previous year and longer waiting times at ports reduced the efficiency of operations.The long-term development of responsibility and the maintenance of a high level of safety are essential to the shipping company’s operations. During the review period, a very unfortunate occupational accident leading to the loss of life took place onboard a vessel owned by AtoBC, ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary, when handling the vessel’s cargo hatches. The investigation of the accident is in progress and, on the basis of its conclusions, specified instructions will be prepared and the changes required will be made in the safety management system.ESL Shipping has succeeded in maintaining its normal service ability and in keeping the supply chains of its customers uninterrupted in the exceptional circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic, in which crew changes, maintenance and spare parts deliveries cannot be carried out normally due to travel restrictions and the lack of flight connections. Coronavirus infections among crew members were successfully limited by taking systematic action so that they did not have any significant impact on vessel traffic during the review period. Advance testing and quarantine arrangements applied to crew members increased costs.During the first quarter, one larger vessel was docked and the dockage of another vessel was started. One smaller vessel owned by ESL Shipping was partly out of operations during the review period due to damage caused by a port crane. Smaller time-chartered vessels of less than 10,000 dwt have been out of operations more than usual due to coronavirus infections, equipment breakage and damage caused by ice conditions, for example.Outlook 2021 for ESL ShippingDemand for transportation in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe has returned to a satisfactory level, and forecasts of transportation volumes in different customer segments are looking positive for the second and third quarters. In the steel industry, demand is expected to remain high during the spring. Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity utilization has been secured in the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe through long-term agreements. ESL Shipping expects total transportation volumes to increase from the previous year. The general development of cargo markets will continue to have the highest impact on the performance of the shipping company’s largest Supramax vessels. Cargo price levels of the largest vessels increased during the fall and winter, being now relatively high considering the recent years’ trend. The development of raw material prices and related uncertainties may affect the development of international cargo markets during the rest of the year.The coronavirus pandemic continues to have a significant impact on operations in the company’s main market areas. Any measures to restrict societal activities, movement restrictions and the shortage of industrial components may have a negative impact on demand among key customers during the rest of the year. Coronavirus infections among crew members may cause delays in vessel traffic and additional costs. Measures aimed to protect the health of the personnel will continue at least at the current level at present.ESL Shipping aims to improve its ability and flexibility to adapt its operations in accordance with the prevailing transportation demand. The number and composition of time-chartered vessels will be reviewed, also in the future, in accordance with any changes in the development and focus areas of customer demand. In the smaller vessel category, price levels are increasing, as the shipping company is signing new time-chartering contracts.ESL Shipping intends to establish more broadly in markets in the Russian Arctic. In Northern Europe, customers are showing a considerably growing interest towards environmentally friendly sea transportation that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. The shipping company will continue its development activities to offer the most effective and environmentally friendly future transportation solutions on the markets. At the same time, ESL Shipping is investigating opportunities to use different new solutions related to the ownership and financing of vessels, used broadly in international shipping company operations, to speed up its operational development.During 2021, significant environmental investments of roughly EUR 6 million, according to an updated assessment, will be targeted at a total of 12 vessels. As a result of equipment installation, the shipping company expects there to be more lay-ups in 2021 than normal, especially during the second and third quarters. Dockages will lower the second and third quarters’ results. A total of 12 larger and three smaller vessel units will be docked during the summer. The docked vessels will be out of operations for a total of 200 days. In the shipping company’s view, stricter environmental regulations will reduce the number of vessels operating in the Baltic Sea.LeipurinLeipurin is a wholesaler specializing in bakery, food industry and foodservice solutions. Leipurin’s business operations are divided into three areas: the bakery business, the machinery business and the foodservice business. The solutions offered by the bakery business comprise raw materials, recipes, product range development and training for bakeries and other food industries. As part of its machinery business, Leipurin designs, delivers and maintains production lines for the baking industry, baking units and other machinery and equipment required in the food industry. The machinery business also includes Vulganus Oy, a manufacturer specializing in freezing and cooling machines. In the foodservice business, Leipurin’s product and service range consists of raw materials and service concepts, such as procurement and logistics services. Leipurin uses leading international producers and manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners. Leipurin operates in Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.1-3/2021 1-3/2020 Change,% Net sales, MEUR 27.9 26.9 3.7 Operating profit, MEUR 0.3 0.6 -50.0 Operating profit, % 1.1 2.2During the first quarter, Leipurin’s operating environment continued to be challenging due to the coronavirus pandemic. Bakery raw material sales for packaged consumer products is returning to normal in the retail channel, while regional restrictions have had a significant negative impact on foodservice and machinery operations. In addition, travel restrictions impede project activities.During the first few weeks of the year, demand was at a normal level in Finnish bakery markets. However, lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic again started to have an impact during the review period. The foodservice market was afflicted by restrictions in all operating countries throughout the quarter.Leipurin’s net sales grew during the first quarter, amounting to EUR 27.9 (26.9) million. Net sales of the bakery business, comprising approximately 74% of Leipurin’s total net sales, decreased by roughly 8% from the comparative period due to the coronavirus pandemic and resulting restrictions, as well as the decrease in the value of the Russian ruble. Significant machine deliveries to Russia, transferred from previous years, increased the net sales of the machinery business, while deliveries remained otherwise low, especially in the company’s own machine production. The foodservice business accounted for roughly 3% of Leipurin’s total net sales during the quarter. The foodservice market also has an indirect impact on Leipurin’s net sales through the bakery business.Net sales in the market area of Russia, other CIS countries, and Ukraine increased considerably by 29% to EUR 11.1 (8.6) million. In eastern markets, net sales of the bakery business decreased by 15% during the first quarter, amounting to EUR 6.6 (7.8) million. However, net sales increased as measured in local currencies.Leipurin’s operating profit decreased from the comparative period to EUR 0.3 (0.6) million. The operating profit rate during the first quarter was 1.1% (2.2). In eastern markets, the total operating profit rate increased to approximately 7% (6). Correspondingly, the operating profit rate of the bakery business was roughly 6% (7). Raw material costs denominated in euro increased strongly due to the decrease in the value of the Russian ruble from the comparative period, and it was not possible to transfer this change wholly to customer prices. In the machinery business, restructurings related to the specified strategy were carried out, resulting in non-recurring costs.Outlook 2021 for LeipurinCoronavirus restrictions have varied in Leipurin’s operating countries. The largest negative impact has been seen in the Baltic countries but the situation has improved for example in Russia. It is still too early to assess the long-term impact of the pandemic on Leipurin’s customers and markets. The situation involving customers and markets is expected to slowly return to normal, provided that the lifting of restrictions proceeds favorably. Leipurin is actively monitoring the development of demand and profitability and is prepared to improve the efficiency of its operations and reduce expenses, if necessary.In the machinery business, the order book is moderate, especially considering the company’s own machine production. The machinery business is expected to become profitable in 2021.Leipurin is preparing for the post-pandemic period by refining its strategy during 2021. The company will continue to invest in growth, especially in eastern markets. The production unit for bakery raw materials in St. Petersburg will be developed further, and the product range will be developed to respond to the new market and price situation. As the local currency has decreased, the competitiveness of local production has improved considerably relative to imported raw materials.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials, industrial chemicals and lubricants. Kauko, reported as part of the Telko segment, is a specialist in demanding mobile knowledge work environments. Telko’s operations are based on representing the best international principals, the expertise of personnel and long-standing customer relationships. The Telko segment has operations in Finland, the Baltic countries, Scandinavia, Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China.1-3/2021 1-3/2020 Change,% Net sales, MEUR 61.0 63.6 -4.1 Operating profit, MEUR 4.5 2.4 87.5 Operating profit, % 7.4 3.8Telko’s market environment continued to recover during the first quarter of 2021. The availability of raw materials sold by Telko has decreased due to shortages in the manufacturing industry. This situation has partially resulted not only from an increase in international demand, but also from the non-functioning of logistics chains and rising price levels. The availability of raw materials decreased significantly during the quarter, weakening the recovery of the increase in net sales. Market prices of all products sold by Telko increased, with the increase in prices being particularly strong at the end of the first quarter.Net sales of the Telko segment decreased during the first quarter to EUR 61.0 (63.6) million. Operating profit increased considerably from the comparative period to EUR 4.5 (2.4) million. The operating profit rate increased during the first quarter to 7.4% (3.8).During the first quarter, net sales of the Telko business decreased by 2.7% to EUR 58.0 (59.6) million. According to its strategy, Telko focuses on higher added value products. In addition to the improved product mix and the positive development of profitability, price increases in the markets accelerated Telko’s operating profit for the first quarter to a record-high of EUR 4.6 (2.4) million.Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 1% to EUR 32.1 (32.5) million. The general price level is very high. Serious availability problems had a negative impact on nearly all product groups and market areas. The proportion of higher added value products was increased, especially in eastern markets, which improved relative profitability.Net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 19% to EUR 16.5 (20.4) million. Availability problems reduced net sales significantly. Product prices increased unusually quickly. Demand in key customer segments has remained stable, despite the unstable market situation.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 40% to EUR 9.4 (6.7) million. The increase in the general price level and the acquisition of ILS Nordic AB and its subsidiary Autolubes Nordic AB in 2020, were the most significant drivers behind increased sales. So far, there have not been any significant problems in the availability of lubricants.Currently, Telko operates in 16 countries with its own organization. Net sales in the market area of Russia, other CIS countries, and Ukraine decreased by 12% to EUR 23.6 (26.9) million. In western markets, net sales increased by 6% to EUR 32.7 (30.8) million. The decreased value of local currencies reduced net sales in eastern markets. Operating profit increased clearly in both market areas, exceeding Telko’s long-term target of 6%. It has been assessed that the profitability and development of operations in Azerbaijan do not meet expectations, and the company’s operations were decided to be discontinued. The discontinuation does not have any significant impact on results in 2021.Kauko’s net sales fell by 25% during the first quarter, amounting to EUR 3.0 (4.0) million. The operating profit of Kauko stood at EUR 0.0 (-0.1) million. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year in IT deliveries.Outlook 2021 for TelkoThe recovery of demand, started in the fall of 2020, continued and is expected to continue at least during the second quarter. The coronavirus pandemic continues to restrict opportunities for normal customer activities.Raw material availability situation is expected to remain challenging in all business operations, at least during the second quarter. Prices of raw materials are expected to continue their increase and to remain high during the next few months.As the market situation is returning to normal, prices are expected to start decreasing, and this is expected to occur during the second half of 2021. Rapid adjustments downwards would have a negative impact on Telko’s results.Demand in Telko’s main markets is high. As availability improves, sales volumes are expected to increase clearly, and net sales are expected to increase from the comparative period.Telko’s goal is to maintain the relative profitability level achieved during 2020. According to its revised strategy, Telko is seeking an even stronger role in the value chain, focusing on cooperation with both customers and principals.Any escalation in the international situation and especially in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine may affect the value of local currencies and impede Telko’s business operations in eastern markets.Kauko expects new equipment and service packages to improve the profitability of basic business operations in 2021. A significant agreement on equipment deliveries to the public sector was signed during the first quarter. If the exceptional circumstances persist, sales of personal protective equipment are expected to remain at a good level.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration, the financial and ICT service center, and a small number of other functions not covered by business units.

The LSEG priced a syndicated multi-tranche and multi-currency offering raising circa $7bn equivalent across nine tranches.This is the first time that Flow has been used to conduct key transaction steps by deal parties in the issuance process. Flow drives end-to-end automation in primary debt markets, and was developed in partnership with Nivaura. Flow is designed to automate the debt capital markets issuance process using structured data and General Purpose Legal Mark-Up Language (GLML), which Nivaura pioneered.The LSEG issuance is the most complex transaction to use a primary DCM digitisation platform. The bonds were listed on the Main Market of The London Stock Exchange, and settled in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. This issuance marks an important milestone in capital markets automation and digitisation, and demonstrates the potential of such platforms to improve current capital market workflows.Over the last five years Nivaura has taken a leading role in new technology to bring efficiency to the primary markets, in active dialogue with regulators and capital markets participants. Nivaura’s focus is on solving the complex issues around the negotiation and documentation of structured data in the primary markets, and its digital and automated workflow solutions are designed to be product-agnostic (e.g. between cash settled products and tokenization). Its solutions are fully flexible, with configurable implementation options including: bespoke, private cloud or on-premise deployment; customisable functionality and white-labelling; and real-time workflows which adapt in response to external data.Nivaura has crucially pioneered the development of General-purpose Legal Mark-up Language (GLML), a human-readable mark-up language designed for easy use by lawyers or other professionals without any programming experience. It makes legal document templates machine readable, enabling transaction data in the document to be captured as “structured data”. GLML has been designed with debt capital market transactions (particularly high volume MTN and CP issuance) in mind, but has a much wider potential applicability.Developed by Nivaura, GLML is now governed by the GLML Foundation, an independent body that is constituted by key capital market participants. This market ownership underpins the vision for GLML as an open-source, universal data standard which all market participants and technology providers can use, making digital and workflow platforms interoperable.Dr. Avtar Singh Sehra, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Nivaura commented: “It has been an honour for Nivaura to work closely with the LSEG, and Allen & Overy, in bringing the LSEG Flow platform to market and supporting its launch with LSEG’s debut multi-currency and multi-tranche transaction. This is the start of a new digitisation and automation paradigm in the primary capital markets, where the LSEG Flow platform delivers proven technology to drive efficiency and effectiveness for all market participants.“For Nivaura, our work here illustrates the flexible ways in which our expertise and solutions can be deployed with partners. We foresee a range of different approaches to primary markets efficiency being pursued, and we’ll act in line with our vision to fully digitise and automate primary markets.“Cutting complexity, time and cost out of primary capital markets by digitising, automating and optimising workflows is now a matter of urgency. GLML will play a crucial role in ensuring different new platforms can be interoperable, ensuring the market benefits fully from digitisation and automation.”","['helps', 'platform', 'market', 'glml', 'issuance', 'data', 'primary', 'dcm', 'capital', 'lseg', 'markets', 'nivaura', 'flow', 'develop']",2021-05-06,finextra.com,Euroclear

(“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“We delivered a solid first quarter in 2021 as the recovery that commenced in the second half of 2020 extended into the first quarter of 2021. We continued to see our business stabilize as revenues in the first quarter were similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. However, gross profit margins improved compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to aggressive cost management to right size the organization and adapt to market demand,” said Yves Paletta, Chief Executive Officer.“While our customers remain cautious, the continued improvement in oil and natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2021 and the rollout of vaccinations provide for a more optimistic outlook for our sector. We have seen an increase in bidding activity due to our service offerings aligning with current market needs, resulting in a strong win rate as evidenced by the $176 million of new awards and contract renewals secured during the first four months of 2021. We believe that activity levels will continue to recover in the second half of 2021,” added Mr. Paletta.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $82.2 million, representing a decrease of $44.6 million or 35.2% from Q1 2020 and a decrease of $2.3 million or 2.7% from Q4 2020.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 9.8%, as compared to 7.2% in Q1 2020 and 9.9% in Q4 2020.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $2.2 million, representing a decrease of $0.5 million or 16% from Q1 2020 and an increase of $0.5 million or 340% from Q4 2020.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $6.0 million, representing a decrease of $0.5 million or 8.8% from Q1 2020 and a decrease of $1.9 million or 24% from Q4 2020.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $66.2 million at March 31, 2021, down from $71.7 million at December 31, 2020 due to a reduction in the maximum borrowing base under the asset-based lending facility effective March 23, 2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and approximately $41 million for the month of April 2021. Approximately 60% of that work will be completed in 2021 with the balance scheduled for 2022-2025.Maintenance and Construction ServicesActivity levels for maintenance and construction services in the first quarter were similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, as public health measures to limit the spread of the virus remained in place. Revenues from maintenance and construction services in Q1 2021 were 4.6% lower than Q4 2020 and 35.8% lower than Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic.With the continuing recovery in world oil prices combined with on-going strength in North American natural gas prices, bidding activity for new work accelerated towards the end of 2020 and has continued to be very active in 2021. We remain focused on consolidating various scopes of work with existing customers by adding additional services to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.During the first quarter, we established a joint venture with Christina River Enterprises, the business entity of the Fort McMurray  468 First Nation, to provide heavy equipment operators in North Eastern Alberta. This joint venture will leverage the experience and strengths of both parties for mutual benefit and growth, and further position us as a leading service provider of heavy equipment operators.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesIn 2020, activity levels for wear technology overlay services remained well below historical levels as customers scaled back their production output and spending on consumables in response to weak oil prices. We saw a modest increase in activity in Q1 2021 with revenues up 13.2% from Q4 2020. With the recovery in world oil prices, we are seeing customers increase their production outlook for 2021, which should result in an increase in demand for wear technology overlay services.Environmental ServicesWe are actively pursuing opportunities with our customers to secure funding under the federal and provincial programs for the closure and reclamation of oil and gas wells, pipelines and facilities in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. We expect the pace at which funding under these programs is released to accelerate in 2021. In addition, we are seeing oil and gas companies increase their own expenditures for reclamation and remediation activities.To accelerate our turnkey asset retirement solution and better support our customers, on February 1, 2021, ClearStream re-branded its environmental services offering as Flint Environmental Services. The combination of our environmental specialists and project managers together with Flint’s personnel operating through its extensive network of facilities in Western Canada, has added value to our integrated full-service offering, as evidenced by the corresponding increase in activity levels in Q1 2021 with revenues up more than 50% from Q4 2020.FIRST QUARTER 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions, except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31, 2021 2020 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 74.0 115.3 (35.8 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 8.6 11.8 (27.2 )% Total 82.2 126.8 (35.2 )% Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 5.9 6.7 (12.1 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.2 2.4 (11.8 )% Total 8.0 9.1 (12.0 )% % of revenue 9.8 % 7.2 % 35.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 6.0 6.5 (8.8 )% % of revenue 7.3 % 5.2 % 40.7 % Adjusted EBITDAS Maintenance and Construction Services. 5.8 6.6 (11.3 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.1 2.4 (14.0 )% Corporate (5.7 ) (6.3 ) (10.4 )% Total 2.2 2.7 (16.0 )% % of revenue 2.7 % 2.1 % 29.6 % Loss from continuing operations (7.6 ) (9.3 ) (18.4 )% Net loss per share from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.08 ) (18.4 )%Note: (1) “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.2021 SUMMARY RESULTS COMMENTARYRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $82,204 compared to $126,799 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 35.2%. The decrease in 2021, in comparison to 2020, was driven by the macro-economic uncertainties and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which started in mid-March 2020 extending through Q1 2021. However, we have seen a stabilization of our business with revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 relatively consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2020 of $84,530. Revenues within the Wear segment and the Environmental division of the Maintenance and Construction segment have increased over Q4 2020.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $8,045 compared to $9,146 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 12.0%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 9.8% compared to 7.2% for the same period in 2020 and is holding consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2020 at 9.9%. As it became clear that the COVID-19 outbreak and other market conditions were going to have longer term impacts on our activity levels and margins across the whole business, we took immediate steps to adjust our cost structures. This included closing ClearStream Wear's locations in Nisku and Edmonton and consolidating all operations into the Sherwood Park location during the third quarter of 2020. These mitigation measures have improved operational flexibility and reduced the fixed costs associated with ClearStream's operations as shown by the increase in gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 in comparison to the three months ended March 31, 2020.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $5,969, in comparison to $6,542 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 8.8%. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were 7.3% compared to 5.2% in the same period in 2020. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to the decline in revenue resulting from macro-economic uncertainty and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to reduced operational volumes, we right sized our SG&A cost structures compared to the prior year as shown by the decrease in total SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDAS was $2,229 compared to $2,653 in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 2.1% for the same period in 2020. Adjusted EBITDAS as a percentage of revenue increased due to gross profit margin increases in both the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the Wear Technology Overlay Services segment.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company qualified for both CEWS and CERS and recorded total subsidies of $6,755 in the Consolidated Interim Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $7,569 compared to a loss of $9,272 for the same period in 2020. The income variance was driven by the government subsidies received in 2021 and the recovery of the share-based compensation and other long-term incentive plans in 2020, offset by the impairment of right of-use assets in 2021 and the goodwill impairment loss in 2020.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn March 23, 2021, ClearStream and the lead lender under its asset-based lending facility entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that extended the maturity date of the revolving facility to March 31, 2022, reduced the maximum borrowings available under the revolving facility to $15 million and effected certain other amendments. Due to ClearStream’s current cash position, it was able to reduce the maximum borrowings available under the revolving facility.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations, maintain compliance with its financial covenants, and maintain a positive cash position through March 31, 2022.As at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, issued and outstanding share capital included 109,992,668 common shares, 127,735 Series 1 preferred shares, and 40,111 Series 2 preferred shares. The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.735 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.OUTLOOKThe third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (including variants) continues to impact both local and global economies. The public health measures to limit the spread of the virus, including business restrictions, travel restrictions, border closures, quarantines and social distancing, will remain in place for the near-term to both slow down the spread and to allow for the global distribution of vaccines to get ahead of this new wave. As the rate of vaccinations increases, we expect that governments will reduce those measures and further re-open their economies, which should increase demand for oil and gas products worldwide.With the current level in world oil prices, we expect that our customers who are involved in the energy sector will realize higher cash flows, and increase their spending to address maintenance projects and asset retirement obligations that have been deferred in the last few years. We expect that activity levels will recover even further in the second half of 2021 as customers prioritize asset management and integrity services to increase operational reliability.With energy transition and environmental considerations becoming increasingly important for all stakeholders in the energy sector, our customers will focus on improving their operational processes for greater efficiencies and reliability.To better support our customers, ClearStream has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 15 operating facilities, we believe that ClearStream is well-positioned to consolidate further multiple services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers every day in helping them to effectively manage their operations.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for three months ended March 31, 2021 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years, ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Mining, Power, Agriculture, Forestry, Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking information including, but not limited to, the success of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, conditions of capital markets, economic conditions, commodity prices, dependence on key personnel, interest rates, regulatory change, ability to meet working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs, factors relating to the weather and availability of labour. These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials, including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results, filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information, management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course, including, without limitation, with respect to general levels of economic activity, regulations, taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it, there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information, and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release, and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively, the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore, ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures, as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS, before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense (recovery), share-based compensation, and other long-term incentive plans. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities, EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service, working capital, capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding the gain on sale of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring costs, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, recovery of contingent consideration liability, other loss, one time incurred expenses, impairment of right-of-use assets, bargain purchase gain, gain on remeasurement of right-of-use assets, and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is used by ClearStream and management believes it is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service, working capital, capital expenditures, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not, on their own, be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows, a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.","['financial', 'measures', 'announces', 'results', 'services', 'months', 'ebitdas', 'million', 'ended', '31', '2021', '2020', 'clearstream', 'quarter']",2021-05-07,globenewswire.com,Euroclear

Our two-step integration approach with UBS has enabled a seamless transition for clients and laid the perfect basis for our continued, long-term partnership with UBS,” says Stephan Leithner, member of the executive board of Deutsche Börse AG and Clearstream chairman, in a prepared statement. “We see significant opportunities to further grow the global footprint of this business, particularly in Europe but also in Asia Pacific.”The transaction is expected to be complete in June 2021, officials say.Prometheum Appoints Ex-FINRA Advisor to be CROPrometheum, a digital asset securities platform, has appointed a former senior advisor for regulator FINRA, Rosemarie Fanelli, to be its next chief regulatory officer (CRO), officials say.Fanelli, who has more than 33 years of regulatory experience, will run Prometheum’s regulatory affairs, officials say.At FINRA, Fanelli served as senior advisor to FINRA’s department of member supervision, “acting as an expert and tactical advisor on complex and novel issues” related to the regulator’s risk monitoring and examination programs, officials say. She “played an influential role in resolving complex regulatory and interpretative matters with the SEC, FINRA member firms, and other agencies.”Fanelli was also a member of FINRA’s Digital Policy Group, which involves “issues concerning digital assets,” and where she served as a digital assets specialist, “assisting FINRA staff with questions, policy, guidance related to digital assets,” officials add.“As digital asset securities and blockchain technology are poised to revolutionize the traditional capital markets, regulatory compliance will become one of the main differentiators for new market entrants,” Fanelli says in a prepared statement.MarketAxess Pilots a ‘Diversity Dealer Initiative’MarketAxess Holdings, an operator of electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, is piloting a Diversity Dealer Initiative, described as “a series of technology enhancements that will enable leading buy-side institutions and minority-, women- and veteran-owned broker-dealers to more easily trade with one another on the MarketAxess platform,” officials say.“The pilot program began in November 2020 and supports trading in investment-grade bonds, high yield bonds, and municipal securities available through the Open Trading marketplace,” according to MarketAxess officials. “Based on significant early interest in the Diversity Dealer Initiative, additional dealer and institutional investor firms are currently being on-boarded.”Current pilot participants include Loop Capital Markets, R. Seelaus & Co., BlackRock, Inc., and AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB), according to MarketAxess officials.MarketAxess, which also provides market data and post-trade services, adds that the initiative leverages the vendor’s “anonymous all-to-all Open Trading marketplace and provides enhanced trading connections by allowing investor clients to select a diversity dealer to intermediate an Open Trading transaction,” officials say. “The Open Trading network of institutional participants creates a significant pool of available liquidity, which delivered over 25,000 credit trading opportunities per day and over $16 billion in daily notional volume in 2020.”“Many institutions want to trade with a more diverse set of counterparties,” says Rick McVey, chairman and CEO of MarketAxess, in a prepared statement. “By eliminating barriers to opportunity and building connectivity in global fixed-income trading, we are able to improve liquidity for all market participants.”","['digital', 'fund', 'street', 'taps', 'post', 'capitolis', 'officials', 'reilly', 'firms', 'state', 'trading', 'capital', 'technology', 'key', 'ubs']",2021-05-11,ftfnews.com,Euroclear

All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“We delivered a solid first quarter in 2021 as the recovery that commenced in the second half of 2020 extended into the first quarter of 2021. We continued to see our business stabilize as revenues in the first quarter were similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. However, gross profit margins improved compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to aggressive cost management to right size the organization and adapt to market demand,” said Yves Paletta, Chief Executive Officer.“While our customers remain cautious, the continued improvement in oil and natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2021 and the rollout of vaccinations provide for a more optimistic outlook for our sector. We have seen an increase in bidding activity due to our service offerings aligning with current market needs, resulting in a strong win rate as evidenced by the $176 million of new awards and contract renewals secured during the first four months of 2021. We believe that activity levels will continue to recover in the second half of 2021,” added Mr. Paletta.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $82.2 million, representing a decrease of $44.6 million or 35.2% from Q1 2020 and a decrease of $2.3 million or 2.7% from Q4 2020.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 9.8%, as compared to 7.2% in Q1 2020 and 9.9% in Q4 2020.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $2.2 million, representing a decrease of $0.5 million or 16% from Q1 2020 and an increase of $0.5 million or 340% from Q4 2020.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $6.0 million, representing a decrease of $0.5 million or 8.8% from Q1 2020 and a decrease of $1.9 million or 24% from Q4 2020.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $66.2 million at March 31, 2021, down from $71.7 million at December 31, 2020 due to a reduction in the maximum borrowing base under the asset-based lending facility effective March 23, 2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and approximately $41 million for the month of April 2021. Approximately 60% of that work will be completed in 2021 with the balance scheduled for 2022-2025.Maintenance and Construction ServicesStory continuesActivity levels for maintenance and construction services in the first quarter were similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, as public health measures to limit the spread of the virus remained in place. Revenues from maintenance and construction services in Q1 2021 were 4.6% lower than Q4 2020 and 35.8% lower than Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic.With the continuing recovery in world oil prices combined with on-going strength in North American natural gas prices, bidding activity for new work accelerated towards the end of 2020 and has continued to be very active in 2021. We remain focused on consolidating various scopes of work with existing customers by adding additional services to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.During the first quarter, we established a joint venture with Christina River Enterprises, the business entity of the Fort McMurray  468 First Nation, to provide heavy equipment operators in North Eastern Alberta. This joint venture will leverage the experience and strengths of both parties for mutual benefit and growth, and further position us as a leading service provider of heavy equipment operators.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesIn 2020, activity levels for wear technology overlay services remained well below historical levels as customers scaled back their production output and spending on consumables in response to weak oil prices. We saw a modest increase in activity in Q1 2021 with revenues up 13.2% from Q4 2020. With the recovery in world oil prices, we are seeing customers increase their production outlook for 2021, which should result in an increase in demand for wear technology overlay services.Environmental ServicesWe are actively pursuing opportunities with our customers to secure funding under the federal and provincial programs for the closure and reclamation of oil and gas wells, pipelines and facilities in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. We expect the pace at which funding under these programs is released to accelerate in 2021. In addition, we are seeing oil and gas companies increase their own expenditures for reclamation and remediation activities.To accelerate our turnkey asset retirement solution and better support our customers, on February 1, 2021, ClearStream re-branded its environmental services offering as Flint Environmental Services. The combination of our environmental specialists and project managers together with Flint’s personnel operating through its extensive network of facilities in Western Canada, has added value to our integrated full-service offering, as evidenced by the corresponding increase in activity levels in Q1 2021 with revenues up more than 50% from Q4 2020.FIRST QUARTER 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions, except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31, 2021 2020 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 74.0 115.3 (35.8 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 8.6 11.8 (27.2 )% Total 82.2 126.8 (35.2 )% Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 5.9 6.7 (12.1 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.2 2.4 (11.8 )% Total 8.0 9.1 (12.0 )% % of revenue 9.8 % 7.2 % 35.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 6.0 6.5 (8.8 )% % of revenue 7.3 % 5.2 % 40.7 % Adjusted EBITDAS Maintenance and Construction Services. 5.8 6.6 (11.3 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.1 2.4 (14.0 )% Corporate (5.7 ) (6.3 ) (10.4 )% Total 2.2 2.7 (16.0 )% % of revenue 2.7 % 2.1 % 29.6 % Loss from continuing operations (7.6 ) (9.3 ) (18.4 )% Net loss per share from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.08 ) (18.4 )%Note: (1) “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.2021 SUMMARY RESULTS COMMENTARYRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $82,204 compared to $126,799 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 35.2%. The decrease in 2021, in comparison to 2020, was driven by the macro-economic uncertainties and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which started in mid-March 2020 extending through Q1 2021. However, we have seen a stabilization of our business with revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 relatively consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2020 of $84,530. Revenues within the Wear segment and the Environmental division of the Maintenance and Construction segment have increased over Q4 2020.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $8,045 compared to $9,146 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 12.0%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 9.8% compared to 7.2% for the same period in 2020 and is holding consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2020 at 9.9%. As it became clear that the COVID-19 outbreak and other market conditions were going to have longer term impacts on our activity levels and margins across the whole business, we took immediate steps to adjust our cost structures. This included closing ClearStream Wear's locations in Nisku and Edmonton and consolidating all operations into the Sherwood Park location during the third quarter of 2020. These mitigation measures have improved operational flexibility and reduced the fixed costs associated with ClearStream's operations as shown by the increase in gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 in comparison to the three months ended March 31, 2020.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $5,969, in comparison to $6,542 for the same period in 2020, a decrease of 8.8%. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were 7.3% compared to 5.2% in the same period in 2020. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to the decline in revenue resulting from macro-economic uncertainty and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to reduced operational volumes, we right sized our SG&A cost structures compared to the prior year as shown by the decrease in total SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.For the three months ended March 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDAS was $2,229 compared to $2,653 in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 2.1% for the same period in 2020. Adjusted EBITDAS as a percentage of revenue increased due to gross profit margin increases in both the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the Wear Technology Overlay Services segment.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company qualified for both CEWS and CERS and recorded total subsidies of $6,755 in the Consolidated Interim Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $7,569 compared to a loss of $9,272 for the same period in 2020. The income variance was driven by the government subsidies received in 2021 and the recovery of the share-based compensation and other long-term incentive plans in 2020, offset by the impairment of right of-use assets in 2021 and the goodwill impairment loss in 2020.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn March 23, 2021, ClearStream and the lead lender under its asset-based lending facility entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that extended the maturity date of the revolving facility to March 31, 2022, reduced the maximum borrowings available under the revolving facility to $15 million and effected certain other amendments. Due to ClearStream’s current cash position, it was able to reduce the maximum borrowings available under the revolving facility.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations, maintain compliance with its financial covenants, and maintain a positive cash position through March 31, 2022.As at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, issued and outstanding share capital included 109,992,668 common shares, 127,735 Series 1 preferred shares, and 40,111 Series 2 preferred shares. The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.735 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.OUTLOOKThe third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (including variants) continues to impact both local and global economies. The public health measures to limit the spread of the virus, including business restrictions, travel restrictions, border closures, quarantines and social distancing, will remain in place for the near-term to both slow down the spread and to allow for the global distribution of vaccines to get ahead of this new wave. As the rate of vaccinations increases, we expect that governments will reduce those measures and further re-open their economies, which should increase demand for oil and gas products worldwide.With the current level in world oil prices, we expect that our customers who are involved in the energy sector will realize higher cash flows, and increase their spending to address maintenance projects and asset retirement obligations that have been deferred in the last few years. We expect that activity levels will recover even further in the second half of 2021 as customers prioritize asset management and integrity services to increase operational reliability.With energy transition and environmental considerations becoming increasingly important for all stakeholders in the energy sector, our customers will focus on improving their operational processes for greater efficiencies and reliability.To better support our customers, ClearStream has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 15 operating facilities, we believe that ClearStream is well-positioned to consolidate further multiple services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers every day in helping them to effectively manage their operations.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for three months ended March 31, 2021 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years, ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Mining, Power, Agriculture, Forestry, Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it, there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information, and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release, and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively, the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore, ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures, as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS, before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense (recovery), share-based compensation, and other long-term incentive plans. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities, EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service, working capital, capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding the gain on sale of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring costs, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, recovery of contingent consideration liability, other loss, one time incurred expenses, impairment of right-of-use assets, bargain purchase gain, gain on remeasurement of right-of-use assets, and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is used by ClearStream and management believes it is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service, working capital, capital expenditures, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not, on their own, be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows, a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.","['financial', 'measures', 'announces', 'results', 'services', 'months', 'ebitdas', 'million', 'ended', '31', '2021', '2020', 'clearstream', 'quarter']",2021-05-06,finance.yahoo.com,Euroclear
Clearstream,1,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kinneviks-board-decided-final-terms-060000762.html,Kinnevik's Board has decided the final terms and timetable for the Zalando distribution,"According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term.The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million.(See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company.Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level.The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.","TipRanksAre we seeing some signs of danger in the markets? At first glance, it wouldn’t seem so. The S&P 500 is sitting just below its record high, as is the Dow Jones average. The big tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft – all posted great results in their recent earnings reports. And yet, they are leading the declines in the NASDAQ. According to Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson, we’re in for a volatile ride, at least in the near-term. ""With the S&P 500 making new highs every day, few seem worried... rather than getting excited about reopening, we are getting more concerned about execution risk and what’s already priced in,” Wilson noted. “Whatever correction the market experiences this year, we are likely to make higher highs next year. The goal as an investor is to navigate the... transition, avoid the stocks with the biggest drawdowns and be in position to capture the next leg."" So, let’s take this advice, and look for ways to protect the portfolio in the short term while staking a position for the longer term. That’s a strategy which will naturally draw investors toward dividend stocks, the classic defensive play. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up two dividend players that combine a Strong Buy sentiment from Wall Street with a yield of at least 7%. Let's take a closer look. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), since these companies have a reputation as solid dividend payers. That’s in part an artifact of their position in regard to tax regulation; they are required to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and the dividend is often a convenient vehicle for compliance. New Residential Investment is typical of its sector, holding a $6 billion investment portfolio, of which just over half is mortgage servicing rights. In its recent 1Q21 financial release, New Residential showed a net income of $301 million, up from $101 million at the end of Q4. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share; the payments totaled $82.9 million. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents per common share, for a yield of 7.5%. This compares favorably to the ~2% yield found among S&P-listed companies. NRZ shares are up 77% in the past 12 months, gaining as the company switched from net losses at the height of the corona crisis to profitability in the last four quarters. To take advantage of the share appreciation, and to raise additional capital, the company announced a public offering of shares in April. The sale generated gross proceeds of $522.4 million on 51.7 million shares sold. The funds raised were used to acquire Caliber Home Loans, with plans to integrate the acquisition into NRZ’s wholly owned mortgage origination service. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 of this year. Covering the stock for BTIG, analyst Eric Hagen writes: “[We] think the company has the capital to be acquisitive in bulk sales transactions as some originators potentially look to offload more thinly capitalized MSRs if origination volume slows more meaningfully. It confirmed the $500 million of capital raised in connection to the Caliber deal was about $0.15 dilutive to NAV, so book is around $11.20. The stock is less than 0.93x book, and about 6.5x forward earnings assuming a 15% ROTCE.” Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $13 price target implies a 25% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) Hagen is no outlier in his bullish opinion here. Of the 10 recent analyst commentaries on this stock, 9 recommend it to Buy, against a single Hold. The $12.69 average price target is almost as bullish as Hagen’s, and suggests an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $10.38. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) We’ll switch gears now, and take a look at an energy company. Specifically, a midstream company. Enterprise Products Partners controls over 50,000 miles of pipelines, along with facilities capable of storing 160 million barrels worth of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In addition, Enterprise has shipping terminals in the state of Texas, on the Gulf Coast. As the US economy has reopened, demand for fuel has increased – which in turn increased the flow of fuel through Enterprise’s system. The company’s financials have been rebounding since the second half of last year, and the recent 1Q21 report showed $9.1 billion at the top line, the best result in the last two years. EPS came in at 61 cents per share, flat year-over-year, but higher than the last three quarters. Enterprise declared a Q2 dividend of 45 cents per common share, the second quarter in a row at this level. The current payment is backed by the company’s $1.7 billion in distributable cash flow. The annualized payment of $1.80 per common share gives a yield of 7.7%. Among the bulls is Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sets a Strong Buy rating on EPD shares, along with a $26 price target. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Backing his stance, Jenkins writes: “While Enterprise (EPD) has not been immune to energy industry challenges, the asset base has continued to show resilience in the difficult environment. Looking forward, EPD's unique combination of integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class, in our view. We see EPD as arguably best positioned to withstand the volatile landscape... This is a compelling opportunity for entry into ownership of one of the best positioned MLPs…” Overall, Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine about EPD’s path forward, as evidenced by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 8 Buy recommendations. The average price target, at $28.75, is more bullish than Jenkins’ and suggests a one-year growth potential of 24% for EPD.

The LSEG priced a syndicated multi-tranche and multi-currency offering raising circa $7bn equivalent across nine tranches.This is the first time that Flow has been used to conduct key transaction steps by deal parties in the issuance process. Flow drives end-to-end automation in primary debt markets, and was developed in partnership with Nivaura. Flow is designed to automate the debt capital markets issuance process using structured data and General Purpose Legal Mark-Up Language (GLML), which Nivaura pioneered.The LSEG issuance is the most complex transaction to use a primary DCM digitisation platform. The bonds were listed on the Main Market of The London Stock Exchange, and settled in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. This issuance marks an important milestone in capital markets automation and digitisation, and demonstrates the potential of such platforms to improve current capital market workflows.Over the last five years Nivaura has taken a leading role in new technology to bring efficiency to the primary markets, in active dialogue with regulators and capital markets participants. Nivaura’s focus is on solving the complex issues around the negotiation and documentation of structured data in the primary markets, and its digital and automated workflow solutions are designed to be product-agnostic (e.g. between cash settled products and tokenization). Its solutions are fully flexible, with configurable implementation options including: bespoke, private cloud or on-premise deployment; customisable functionality and white-labelling; and real-time workflows which adapt in response to external data.Nivaura has crucially pioneered the development of General-purpose Legal Mark-up Language (GLML), a human-readable mark-up language designed for easy use by lawyers or other professionals without any programming experience. It makes legal document templates machine readable, enabling transaction data in the document to be captured as “structured data”. GLML has been designed with debt capital market transactions (particularly high volume MTN and CP issuance) in mind, but has a much wider potential applicability.Developed by Nivaura, GLML is now governed by the GLML Foundation, an independent body that is constituted by key capital market participants. This market ownership underpins the vision for GLML as an open-source, universal data standard which all market participants and technology providers can use, making digital and workflow platforms interoperable.Dr. Avtar Singh Sehra, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Nivaura commented: “It has been an honour for Nivaura to work closely with the LSEG, and Allen & Overy, in bringing the LSEG Flow platform to market and supporting its launch with LSEG’s debut multi-currency and multi-tranche transaction. This is the start of a new digitisation and automation paradigm in the primary capital markets, where the LSEG Flow platform delivers proven technology to drive efficiency and effectiveness for all market participants.“For Nivaura, our work here illustrates the flexible ways in which our expertise and solutions can be deployed with partners. We foresee a range of different approaches to primary markets efficiency being pursued, and we’ll act in line with our vision to fully digitise and automate primary markets.“Cutting complexity, time and cost out of primary capital markets by digitising, automating and optimising workflows is now a matter of urgency. GLML will play a crucial role in ensuring different new platforms can be interoperable, ensuring the market benefits fully from digitisation and automation.”","['helps', 'platform', 'market', 'glml', 'issuance', 'data', 'primary', 'dcm', 'capital', 'lseg', 'markets', 'nivaura', 'flow', 'develop']",2021-05-06,finextra.com,Euroclear

The product dubbed VanEck Vectors Digital Assets Equity UCITS ETF will be publicly available on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse under the ticker DAPP with a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.65%.Notably, the newly launched ETF will track the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index that is composed of companies that at least make 50% of their revenue from digital assets. “It’s great to see a pure-play crypto equity ETF come to market in Europe,” Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset director at VanEck, told CoinDesk Thursday. “It’s the first of its kind.”VanEck and the Cryptocurrency ETF MarketVanEck launched a similar product through the Nasdaq earlier this year. Moreover, the firm is awaiting the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a ruling on a Bitcoin ETF at least in June.The company anticipates the current Bitcoin ETF filed with the SEC will be approved based on the market growth. Furthermore, the SEC approved Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) IPO, painting a picture the cryptocurrency industry is here to stay.“The digitalization of the global economy has been picking up steam for the past several years, and as digital assets1 mature, this has driven the growth of several innovative companies – not only miners of digital assets but also digital asset exchanges, payments, services, storage, e-commerce and much more,” said Ed Lopez, Managing Director, Head of ETF Product for VanEck. “To this point, however, investors have had to choose among funds that too often included companies only tangentially involved with digital assets. That is something we’ve sought to solve with the launch of DAPP, a fund we’re very excited to be bringing to market.”Although the cryptocurrency industry has surpassed $2 trillion in market capitalization, some analysts still think the market is not yet mature enough for the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF. Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood recently told an audience she thinks the bitcoin market might need to see $2 trillion in demand before the SEC is comfortable with an ETF.All prior Bitcoin ETFs filed to the SEC were disqualified by the prior administration. However, the cryptocurrency industry anticipates a change with the Biden administration through newly appointed SEC chair Gary Gensler.However, the conversation might be still premature based and perhaps down on the list of things to be accomplished. “It’s certainly too early to say what his view will be on crypto, whether it will be a priority, what that will do to influence the market, and I think that may even be a premature conversation,” noted Matthew Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management.","['market', 'bitcoin', 'digital', 'product', 'global', 'europe', 'etf', 'vaneck', 'assets', 'launches', 'dapp', 'cryptocurrency', 'transformation', 'sec']",2021-05-08,coinspeaker.com,Euroclear

In its 10-K for 2020, the company wrote, ""Today, we are a Fortune 500 company, providing our customers with an array of marketplace infrastructure, data services and technology solutions that span a diverse set of asset classes.""The company was founded in 2000 and debuted on the NYSE in 2005. In 2001, it acquired the International Petroleum Exchange. The New York Board of Trade was bought in 2007 and the Climate Exchange in 2010.It made its entry into the data services business in 2003, the clearing house business in 2008, fixed income in 2015 and mortgage services in 2018. Today, it operates in three segments and primarily in two countries, the U.S. and the UK:Exchanges: This segment delivered $3.6 billion in net revenues in 2020, an increase of 10% over the previous year.Fixed Income and Data Services: This segment produced revenue of $1.8 billion in 2020.Mortgage Technology: This segment produced revenue of $1.2 billion, which includes contributions from its acquisition of Ellie Mae last September.Revenues come in two forms, transactions (one-time) and recurring (subscriptions):Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyRisksIn its 10-K, the company lists numerous risks, including:Conditions in financial markets.The effects of Covid-19.Changes in laws, regulations and government policy.Volatility in the prices of commodities, equities and financial benchmarks.The inherent risks of operating clearing houses.Debt: The company advised that it carries a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operations.Story continuesCompetitionIntercontinental breaks down its competition by segment:Exchanges: ""We face competition from other exchanges, electronic trading systems, third-party clearing houses, technology firms, market data vendors and trading facilities in the U.S. and globally."" It also notes that competition is intense; for exchange listings, the competition is with Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) and Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE).Fixed Income and Data Services: On the fixed income side, it competes with other electronic trading venues. Data Services competes, broadly, with ""purchased third-party information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data.""Mortgage Technology competes with other digital mortgage solution providers, including Black Knight, Inc. (NYSE:BKI).Elsewhere in the 10-K, it reports that its peer group includes CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), Deutsche Boerse AG (listed in Germany), IHS Markit LTD (NYSE:INFO), London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSEG), MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) and S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI).Financial strengthIntercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyAs the red on this table suggests, Intercontinental has a lot of debt. The following chart shows how it has grown in relation to cash:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyPart of the reason for the growth of debt is acquisitions. The company has made many of them since going public; most recently, it bought the mortgage software company Ellie Mae. The latter provides technology to credit unions and non-bank lenders, helping them originate residential mortgage loans. Since Ellie Mae currently processes 35% of American mortgage applications, the acquisition will widen Intercontinental's reach in the mortgage industry.The deal also added to the debt load. Of the $11 billion paid, 84% was in cash ($9.24 billion) and 16% was in Intercontinental's shares. At the end of the second quarter, just before the deal was finalized, the company had just $880 million in cash and cash equivalents. Thus, we have to conclude most of the cash in the deal involved debt.Note, too, that the current weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is higher than its return on invested capital (ROIC), indicating the company's growth is not profitable.ProfitabilityIntercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyThe profitability table is more promising, with a series of green bars indicating Intercontinental generally outperforms its peers and competitors in the Capital Markets industry.On the other hand, it is underperforming its own history over the past decade. Here, for example, are the operating margin and net margin:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyOn the growth lines, we see both revenue and Ebitda are making gains while earnings per share (without non-recurring items) appear to have slipped over the past three years. Yet, when we look at a chart of diluted earnings over the past 10 years, we see that while earnings slipped in 2018 and 2019, they began to recover in 2020:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyDividend and share buybacksIntercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyIntercontinental's current dividend yield is 1.06%, roughly half of the S&P 500 average, but there's more to see behind the curtain.Over the past three years, the three-year dividend growth rate has been 14.50% per year. However, that nearly has been overshadowed by the growth of the share price, which has averaged 14.41% per year over the past three years.This 10-year chart of the share price and the dividend yield helps put the yield into perspective:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyInvestors who bought for the dividend have been better rewarded than first impressions would suggest:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyRegarding share repurchases, Intercontinental has been active on both sides of the ledger:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyIn 2015, the year that saw a big increase in the number of shares, it bought Interactive Data Corp for $5.2 billion. Of that amount, $3.65 billion was in cash and $1.55 billion was made up of Intercontinental's stock. At the end of 2014, it had just $1.852 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.ValuationThe GuruFocus Value Line concludes that Intercontinental is fairly valued:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyThe price-earnings ratio comes in on the high side at 30.71 when compared with the industry median of 17.61 and the company's own 10-year median of 23.00.The PEG ratio (which is the price-earnings ratio divided by the five-year Ebitda growth rate) is above fair valuation as well. It is 2.65 compared with the industry median of 1.89 and its own historical median of 1.45.The discounted cash flow (DCF) calculator arrives at a fair valuation using the below assumptions:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyComparative returnsThis 10-year chart shows Intercontinental outperforming some of its competitors, but not keeping up with the Nasdaq:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyGurusThe investing gurus were net buyers of Intercontinental during the final quarter of 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. Since then, their interest has faded:Intercontinental Exchange: Steady Growth From a Fairly Valued CompanyEleven gurus held positions in the stock at the end of 2020, with the three largest holdings being:Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) of ARK Investment Management, who loaded up in the fourth quarter of 2020, adding 215.98% to finish the year with 4,557,974 shares, representing 0.81% of Intercontinental's shares and 1.40% of her firm's assets.Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio) held 3,895,521 shares after reducing its holding by 15.16%.Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb finished the year with 3,469,593 shares, 0.42% fewer than at the end of the third quarter.ConclusionIntercontinental Exchange is a stock the has delivered consistent growth with little volatility. For aggressive income investors, I think it might even be considered a substitute for a bond. For those seeking even higher returns, Nasdaq stock might be a better choice.We know its financial strength is compromised by the amount of debt it has taken on to make acquisitions and to earn future revenue and income. Profitability is very good, and it appears to be fairly valued. The dividend is better than it might appear, and it may continue to buy back its own shares.For value investors, there are two strikes against Intercontinental, its debt and no meaningful margin of safety. Prudent growth investors might see this stock as providing solid capital gains with less-than-average volatility. Income investors may see this as an opportunity to get both capital gains and a dividend in one package.Disclaimer: I do not own shares in any of the companies named in this article and do not expect to buy any in the next 72 hours.Not a Premium Member of GuruFocus?
