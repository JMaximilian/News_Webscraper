From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.

archived recording We begin in China, where embattled real estate giant Evergrande faces a major moment of truth this week.

michael barbaro

One of the biggest and most important corporations in China, which both fueled and profited from the country’s historic housing boom —

archived recording Shares in the highly indebted company have fallen 80 percent this year.

michael barbaro

— is now on the brink of collapse —

archived recording Analysts fear the crisis could spread throughout China’s property sector and the entire economy.

michael barbaro

— raising fears of a broader financial crisis in a country that prides itself on stability and control.

archived recording Evergrande was always thought to be too big to fail. Now where have we heard that one before?

michael barbaro

Today: I spoke to my colleague Alexandra Stevenson about the rise and fall of Evergrande. It’s Monday, October 25. Alex, most of us have never heard of this company, Evergrande. But my sense is that if you live in China, it’s a household name. And I know that you have been reporting on this company for a really long time. So what should we know about it?

alexandra stevenson

Yeah, Evergrande is a household name in China. It’s actually one of the country’s most prolific developers. And its properties are in hundreds of cities across the country. Its rise, and the rise of its founder, Xu Jiayin, really mirrors that of China’s entire economy. And it tells the story of China’s early embrace of capitalism. And Xu’s story is also really interesting. He grew up poor in a rural village in the central province of Hunan. He has described in speeches memories of eating sweet potatoes and sweet potato flour, and just being sick of sweet potatoes, and studying under a thatched roof that didn’t keep out wind or rain. He has described how he went on to become a steel factory technician at a state-owned enterprise, because it was still at a time when China’s economy was mostly centrally planned.

[music]

But as he’s sort of going through those early years in the workforce, China is beginning to talk about opening up. And in 1996, a little more than a decade after he starts out, he decides he’s going to set up his own business in the city of Shenzhen, which at the time was a special economic zone that China’s leader, Deng Xiaoping, had first chosen as the place to launch an experiment with capitalism. And so Evergrande is born there. And so at that time, China was just embarking on this massive project of moving hundreds of millions of people from the countryside to the cities, and creating new cities out of dirt villages. And as they’re doing that, Xu is selling the dream of home ownership to a very small but starting-to-grow middle class. And as China urbanizes, Evergrande expands beyond Shenzhen to really all corners of China, building towards what ends up being this remarkable property boom that China sees for decades.

michael barbaro

Describe that property boom.

alexandra stevenson

China’s property boom has been a wild ride.

archived recording Skyscrapers, shopping malls, high-speed trains, even new cities are popping up. Every year, 20 new cities are built from scratch in China, each with more than a million people.

alexandra stevenson

And for anybody who’s ever gotten on a train and gone from one city to another in China, you can see —

archived recording Cranes dot the skyline amid new plazas, parks and housing developments.

alexandra stevenson

— just hundreds of cranes as you come into any city, and huge, sprawling property developments always under construction.

archived recording Just in the last few years, China has used more cement than the United States did in the entire last century.

alexandra stevenson

One of the things, the first time that I went to Beijing in the mid 2000s, was just being shocked that one week, there’s just like a dirt plot, and then the next week, something is there in its place. Multistory building, and it’s just the skeleton, but it’s already gone up. And a lot of the property developers in China will throw up these towering banners with images of Central Park, or kind of iconic places around the world in major cities, to sort of associate themselves with success.

archived recording Central Villa District, Beijing. World class villas of contemporary China.

alexandra stevenson

And Evergrande itself was selling this lifestyle associated with names like Cloud Lake Royal Garden, Empire View, Luxury Palace.

archived recording Enjoying a good reputation for the popular international school district.

alexandra stevenson

And so Xu and Evergrande were part of that boom of selling this idea to what was becoming a burgeoning middle class.

archived recording Evergrande [INAUDIBLE], out of the ordinary in the world.

michael barbaro

So they’re not just selling apartments, it sounds like they’re selling an idea of success and happiness very effectively.

alexandra stevenson

Yeah, they’re selling wealth, this idea of wealth and prosperity. And suddenly, before you know it, Evergrande has built millions of individual apartments across the country. And so by 2009, it’s big enough that it decides to go public in Hong Kong, and it raises over $700 million. And this opens up the doors to a whole new world of financing from Wall Street, and from other global financial capitals outside of China. And it’s also when Xu starts to dabble in new areas of business, and he starts to make trophy purchases.

archived recording We’re going to start with football, and Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande.

alexandra stevenson

Like a soccer team in 2010.

archived recording Today, they signed Colombian forward Jackson Martinez for a record fee —

alexandra stevenson

And he’s dumping up millions of dollars for foreign players.

archived recording The transfer from Atletico Madrid is the biggest in the history of the Chinese Super League.

alexandra stevenson

And he gets into dairy, and then he gets into oil and pig farming.

michael barbaro

Wow.

alexandra stevenson

And eventually —

archived recording [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

alexandra stevenson

— he even starts an electric vehicle company that promised to be bigger and better than Tesla.

archived recording [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

alexandra stevenson

And there’s this scene in a recent memoir from a Chinese businessman named Desmond Shum. The book is called “Red Roulette.” And in it, Xu takes a trip on a private jet with some friends. They fly to Paris, and then when they get there, they spend an evening downing like $100,000 worth of Chateau Lafite wine.

michael barbaro

Wow.

alexandra stevenson

And later, they take this trip to the French Riviera where Xu is considering buying a yacht for $100 million that’s owned by this Hong Kong mogul.

michael barbaro

$100 million yacht after a $100,000 wine spree?

alexandra stevenson

Yeah. I mean, this is like, $100,000 is chump change for this guy at this point in his career. And it’s this scene that kind of really illustrates just how Xu and his company rode this tremendous property boom in China, unlike any that the world had ever seen. And he was at the center of it. And by 2018, Xu is China’s richest man. But the problem is, the property boom becomes based more on speculation than true demand.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

alexandra stevenson

At some point in the past decade, basically, the government loses control. And it’s Evergrande and other developers who are actually fueling the speculative activity in the property market. And for a while, it didn’t matter because everyone was benefiting. So you had local governments who were selling land to developers who are benefiting, you had investors who kept lending to companies like Evergrande who were benefiting. And you had households who really had very few other options for where to put their savings, putting it into property. And they were benefiting, because prices kept going up and up and up. But all that speculative activity led to more apartments in China than there are people who could possibly live in them. And it also created some of the most unaffordable property in the world. So now you have a situation where young people who are just starting out can’t possibly imagine actually ever being able to own a place to call home. So it’s hard for them to see how things are getting better. And if young people don’t see possibility in their future, that causes a much bigger problem for the Communist Party and for the government as a whole.

michael barbaro

So the problem is that Evergrande is leading a speculative housing bubble, and that is leading to social inequality?

alexandra stevenson

Exactly. And the problem for Evergrande was that in participating in this housing bubble, it had borrowed an unbelievably large amount of money: $300 billion.

michael barbaro

Wow.

alexandra stevenson

Making it the most indebted real estate developer in the world. But then, August 2020 happens. And the central bank goes, enough is enough, and basically cuts off lending to developers like Evergrande, and forces them to start addressing their debt and start paying it off. So at this point, Evergrande is running out of options for ways to find cash. The banks are no longer lending to it, and so there’s really nowhere for Evergrande to turn, and a lot of people, a long line of people outside their door, asking for money and asking for it now.

michael barbaro

So this is starting to look like a company that’s on the verge of financial collapse.

alexandra stevenson

Yes.

michael barbaro

And how does the world come to understand that?

alexandra stevenson

Well, it’s actually not until this summer, in August, when authorities summon Evergrande in for this meeting. And then they issue a statement afterwards. And it’s short and terse, but it hints at how Beijing sees Evergrande, that it’s kind of this corporate bad-doer, and that it might be made an example of. And so that’s when the panic really starts to begin, and suddenly, people start worrying, and the rumor starts that Evergrande is actually on the verge of bankruptcy. And that’s when we start reaching out to people whose lives have been affected, and in some cases destroyed, by Evergrande.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Alex, tell us about these people that you met whose lives have been upended by the problems inside Evergrande.

alexandra stevenson

So in August, we start trying to find as many people as we can who we think may have been affected by Evergrande’s crisis. And so we start with homebuyers. And we find this guy named Wesley Jong. He’s 33 years old, and he tells us that four years ago, he bought an apartment that hadn’t been completed yet. And at the time, he puts down $138,000, which is basically the life savings of his parents and some of his own savings. And then he starts making monthly mortgage payments on top of that. And at this point, he’s made more than 40 monthly payments. And it’s four years later, and he still hasn’t seen the apartment. It’s not finished.

michael barbaro

Wow.

alexandra stevenson

And so what we learn in our reporting is that this guy Wesley Jong is actually just one of some 1.6 million people who just like him, put money down for an apartment that Evergrande, because of its problems, has not been able to finish.

michael barbaro

So there are now a lot of people who have poured their life savings into homes and into the dream that Evergrande has created of a middle class existence, and they’ve gotten nothing in return?

alexandra stevenson

Yeah. It’s a lot of angry homebuyers. And we start talking to other people who are affected by Evergrande. And we come across this contractor named Yong Jushang, who’s from a city in central China. And he and his workers finish their job with Evergrande in May, but he tells us that he hasn’t been paid since February. And at this point, Evergrande owes him $0.5 million.

michael barbaro

Wow.

alexandra stevenson

And it’s not just him, because he’s hired a bunch of workers to help him with the job. And at this point, he’s worried that his whole business is basically going to collapse. And so that’s the story of homebuyers and contractors who are affected by Evergrande. But what really surprised us, at this point in our reporting, was that employees also were deeply affected by Evergrande’s troubles. So we come across this guy named Jin Cheng who’s 28, and he works for Evergrande in the eastern city of Hefei. And he tells us in April of this year, his bosses basically said, you need to stump up a certain amount of money — for him, it was $62,000 — and invest it in this high interest investment product, but give us the money. So it’s basically like a short-term high interest loan. And we later learned that 70 percent to 80 percent of Evergrande employees across the country were told that they needed to hand over some amount of money as a loan, and that if they didn’t come up with that money, that their bonus would be docked. So it was sort of strong-armed, right? And Jin Cheung, the employee we spoke to, told us that he didn’t feel like he had an option.

michael barbaro

So Evergrande is forcing its employees to bail out their employer, because it has so recklessly been borrowing, and has run out of money?

alexandra stevenson

That’s right. And many employees said they borrowed from parents and in-laws. Some said they put in hundreds of thousands of dollars. And some of these high interest loans that were packaged as investment products, they were meant to be paid in September. And so everything’s starting to come to a head. Evergrande has been chastised by the government. Rumors of its bankruptcy are spreading on the internet. And at the same time, they’re telling employees who are expecting their money back, plus an interest, that they have to wait. And so that’s when employees start panicking, and that’s when they start joining others, homebuyers and contractors, suppliers, in actually protesting.

archived recording [CROWD YELLING]

michael barbaro

Like, actual protesting on the streets?

alexandra stevenson

Yeah, which is unusual for China.

archived recording [CROWD YELLING]

alexandra stevenson

We’re talking groups of 50 or 100. These aren’t massive protests, not like what you might think happens in the U.S. But there’s one scene at one point where investors and homebuyers crowd into the lobby of Evergrande’s headquarters in Shenzhen, and it’s super chaotic.

archived recording [CROWD YELLING]

alexandra stevenson

And outside, you just see these police with these giant riot shields. And it disappears as quickly as the protest started. And then all we see after, for days later, are the police officers with their riot shields outside the headquarters of Evergrande.

michael barbaro

So this is more than just a company imploding at this point, if you’re the Chinese government — this has all the makings of potentially social unrest, something that is very, very unusual in China.

alexandra stevenson

Yeah. But just as quickly as we see these protests, they’re silenced, as they always are. And some protesters later tell us that they’re contacted by the police, and intimidated. And at this point, Evergrande is really starting to run out of money and out of time. And this is sort of mid-September. It hasn’t been able to raise money by selling off parts of its business. It’s also run out of other ways to find money, like tapping employees. And probably more important than anything else, no one is buying any of its apartments. And that’s when things get really bad, because Evergrande is days away from this deadline for a really important interest payment that it owes to foreign investors. And that day comes.

archived recording There was no sign that ailing Chinese developer Evergrande paid $83 million in interest payments it owed offshore bondholders.

alexandra stevenson

And Evergrande doesn’t make the payment.

archived recording The Thursday deadline for the payment came and went with complete silence from the firm.

alexandra stevenson

So at this point now, Evergrande is at risk of defaulting. And the whole world is now watching. And you start to see headlines raising the question —

archived recording With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns of a messy collapse.

alexandra stevenson

— if Evergrande defaults on its debt —

archived recording It could spread through China’s financial system and reverberate around the world.

alexandra stevenson

— is this going to lead to some kind of financial crisis in China?

michael barbaro

So Alex, explain that. How could the collapse of Evergrande produce a larger financial crisis in China? How would that work?

alexandra stevenson

Well, consider this scenario. So Evergrande disappears, and that spills over into the broader housing market, and you start to see properties lose value. Then you see new property prices start to plummet. Then homes start to become worth less than the mortgages that people are paying on them. And then there are all the companies and the banks and the financial institutions that Evergrande owes money to. And they start to find themselves in trouble. And then, finally, panic starts to set in. Doubts grow about all these other companies, like Evergrande, that have so much debt, that maybe they can’t go on either. And so that’s the thing about financial panic. It’s all about fear and emotion. And those are things that are really hard to contain.

michael barbaro

Right. So the problem is if Evergrande goes under, lots of people get hurt, which is part of the financial crisis. But the part of a financial crisis that would be hard to predict would be the fear that there are lots of little Evergrandes dotted around the Chinese economy. And if that fear starts to grow, that’s what a financial crisis would look like. People might pull their money out of those companies, investors might demand their money back, and all of a sudden, the entire Chinese economy is on the brink of some sort of collapse.

alexandra stevenson

Yeah. And in that scenario, it’s kind of like what we saw in the U.S. in 2008, which was a big shock to one industry suddenly undermining confidence in an entire economy.

michael barbaro

So I have to imagine that China has some kind of a plan to help Evergrande get through this and avoid that nightmare scenario you just outlined, Alex. And so are they gearing up — the Chinese government — to essentially bail out Evergrande?

alexandra stevenson

That’s the thing, not necessarily. We don’t actually know what the government is going to do. There’s actually a very good chance that China will let Evergrande fail.

michael barbaro

So why would that be? Why would China not bail out Evergrande?

alexandra stevenson

Because China thinks that it can actually avoid that nightmare scenario. I think the Communist Party believes it has the power to eventually pay the contractors and make sure that all the suppliers that Evergrande owes money to will in some way get some of the money they’re owed. That the homebuyers who are waiting on apartments, that those apartments ultimately get built by someone. Because the last thing that the Communist Party is willing to sacrifice is political instability. If that means making sure that ordinary people are made somewhat whole in the fallout of this, they will go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that happens. What they fear is that in bailing out Evergrande, they will be sending a message to companies that don’t pay their debts that they will be bailed out if they borrow too much. And in this scenario, China’s property market just keeps getting bigger and bigger, and prices go up and up. And that gap that already exists between the rich and poor just gets bigger. And that is just not good for China, because at this point in their trajectory, they want to create economic growth that the wider population can participate in.

michael barbaro

And so letting Evergrande fail, potentially, you’re saying, puts China on a better, healthier, more sustainable, fairer, more equal economic path that is in line with what the Chinese Communist Party says are its values. And so China can live with the potential short-term pain of an Evergrande collapse because what it gets in return is just a better long-term China?

alexandra stevenson

Yeah, that by letting Evergrande fail, maybe China can start to move its economy away from this speculative model of borrowing and borrowing that has created these huge bubbles.

michael barbaro

So at the end of the day, what does all of this say about the Chinese economic experiment that started 40 years ago, as you told us, and that Evergrande and its founder have really come to embody? Does this in some ways mean that that economic experiment has failed?

alexandra stevenson

It’s hard to say that the past 40 years of China’s economic growth has been a failure if you just look at all the people who have been lifted from poverty. I think the better way to look at it is that this moment is a test for just how socialist China is. It’s run by the Chinese Communist Party, but for four decades it’s really been — in many parts of the economy — just the Wild West in terms of capitalism. This change that needs to happen in this moment in time is a test of whether the Chinese Communist Party is really serious about its socialist roots — this idea that everybody should partake in the wealth of the country.

michael barbaro

Because what happened with Evergrande was not adhering to that socialist vision?

alexandra stevenson

I mean, I think if you look at Xu at the height of his success, there was an incredible amount of excess. For somebody to be able to, on a whim, spend $100 million on a yacht, that’s not really in line with core socialist principles. What’s also happening in the backdrop here at the moment is China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is talking a lot about this idea of common prosperity. And it’s not new, it’s something that Mao talked about, and every Chinese leader has talked about. But it could actually mean something right now, because if China lets Evergrande fail, and the authorities are serious about pivoting its economy and creating a society where wealth is more evenly distributed, that would get the Party a little bit closer to its theoretical roots.

By Tom Westbrook and Donny Kwok

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Debt-saddled China Evergrande is set to raise more than $5 billion by selling a majority stake in its property management arm, Chinese media said on Monday, a deal which would be the struggling giant's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead.

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Evergrande on Monday said it requested a halt in the trading of its shares in Hong Kong pending an announcement about a major transaction. Evergrande Property Services Group, a spin-off listed last year, also requested a halt and said it referred to ""a possible general offer for shares of the company.""

China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development was the buyer of a 51% stake in the property business for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing unspecified other media reports. Hopson also said it had suspended its shares, pending an announcement related to a major acquisition of a Hong Kong-listed firm and a possible mandatory offer.

Neither Hopson nor Evergrande responded to requests for comment on the Global Times report.

Analysts said the possible deal signals the company is still working to meet its obligations. But it also underscored concerns about the rest of China's property sector and the broader economy if there is a fire-sale of Evergrande's assets.

""Selling an asset means they are still trying to raise cash to pay the bills,"" said OCBC analyst Ezien Hoo. ""Looks like the property management unit is the easiest to dispose in the grand scheme of things.""

There was another key development in the sector on Monday too as one of Evergrande's smaller rivals, Fantasia Holdings', said it had missed a $206-million bond payment deadline.

Credit ratings agency Fitch had slashed the firm's credit rating by four notches earlier in the day, too, after the firm revealed it had underwritten another bond that it had previously not disclosed on its books.

With a market value of $415 million, Fantasia is a minnow. But its missed deadline adds to worries of a sector-wide crunch that could put further pressure on China's already slowing economy.

The $5 billion Evergrande would earn from its reported sale meanwhile would theoretically cover the firm's international bond payments for the next six months. It has around $500 million in coupon payments due by the end of the year, followed by a $2-billion dollar bond maturity in March.

The price represents a roughly 17.5% discount to the Services Group's December 2020 listing valuation, although Evergrande's group shares have slumped 80% since then.

In contrast, Hopson's shares have jumped 40% this year making it worth around HK$60 billion ($7.8 billion).

NERVOUSNESS

Evergrande's property services business, which says it managed a total contracted floor area of 810 million square metres at the end of June, was also profitable in the first half of 2021, based on its financial statements.

With liabilities equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, Evergrande has sparked concerns its troubles could spread through the global financial system.

Nervousness has eased after China's central bank vowed to protect homebuyers' interests, but ramifications for China's economy kept investors on edge - particularly as signs of distress have begun spreading to Evergrande's peers.

Monday's share trading suspension knocked the , which fell about 0.3% against the dollar, and weighed on the benchmark index.

Still, the possible deal activity lifted shares in Evergrande's electric vehicle unit by 29% but cast a pall over regional stocks and global markets. [MKTS/GLOB]

""It is definitely a positive move towards solving Evergrande’s liquidity crisis and we expect more to come,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist Asia Pacific at Natixis.

""However, having said that, offloading some assets may not be totally sufficient, the key for Evergrande is to get project construction going and to sell inventory.""

Shares in Evergrande have plunged 80% so far this year, while its bonds have held steady at distressed levels.

The group said last month it had negotiated a settlement with some domestic bondholders and made a repayment on some wealth management products, largely held by Chinese retail investors.

Holders of the company's $20 billion in offshore debt appear further back in the creditor queue and bondholders have said interest payments due in the past few weeks have failed to arrive.

Evergrande faces deadlines on dollar bond coupon payments totalling $162.38 million in October.

Summary China bond markets suffer September outflows of $8.1 bln -IIF

Fitch: APAC junk issuers' funding costs rise to 7.5%

Bond markets will see wall of maturity in next two years

China sovereign bonds will start joining FTSE Russell WGBI

LONDON/HONG KONG, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Global investors will probably demand more protection from riskier bond issuers in China and Asia by seeking higher returns and more transparency as a result of Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) financial woes.

Suffocating under $305 billion in debt and teetering on the brink of collapse, property developer Evergrande missed making payments to offshore bondholders twice last month and has not announced plans yet to repay those investors.

It has another eight offshore and one onshore coupon repayments due before year end.

The failure to make payment, followed by a string of credit rating downgrades of indebted Chinese developers, has roiled China's high-yield debt, sparked outflows and is now making asset managers jittery about issuers in the region, investors and analysts said.

Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based PineBridge Investments head of Asia ex-Japan, fixed income, thinks the heady mix of debt woes and changing regulations in China is shifting goal posts for foreign investors.

""These uncertainties have caused material impact to the risk appetite for the Chinese assets,"" Lau told Reuters. ""A higher risk premium may warrant given the unpredictability of policy reforms at the moment.""

Signs of stress in China's property sector are coming thick and fast: developer Fantasia Holdings (1777.HK) failed to pay a $206 million bond due Monday. Its peer Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) suffered a ratings downgrades on Tuesday after certain units missed interest payments on onshore financing arrangements.

Uncertainty over when and if authorities will step in to cushion the contagion risk from Evergrande at a time when Beijing's regulatory crackdown has already frayed nerves and growth in the economy is slowing has sent bonds sharply lower.

Foreign investors yanked $8.1 billion out of Chinese debt in September - the largest outflow in six months - while emerging market fixed income ex-China enjoyed inflows, data from the Institute of International Finance showed.

Much of the pain is concentrated in high yield firms in the country: ICE BofA's China high yield index (.MERACYC) has lost around a quarter since the start of the year while the global benchmark and China investment grade peers barely budged.

Evergrande woes crush China high yield bonds

Analysts say the sharp losses for Chinese junk bonds reflected both default risk and uncertainty over how to value bonds given the unclear picture of how Evergrande debt may be restructured and authorities' ability to stop the spread to other firms.

Standing at 160% of gross domestic predict (GDP), China's non-financial corporate debt is higher than the advanced economy average and ratings agencies have regularly flagged asset quality as a concern, said Adam Slater at Oxford Economics.

""How much of the recent rise in risk premia prove to be permanent is as yet unclear,"" he said, adding much would hinge on the success of Chinese authorities at containing financial contagion from Evergrande.

Pressure has been felt outside the property sector, too.

Bonds maturing in five years and issued by West China Cement (2233.HK), aluminium producer China Hongqiao Group (1378.HK) and leasing firm Ehi Car have seen their yields jump by more than 1 percentage point since end-August.

Evergrande's reverberations are being felt beyond China. Ratings agency Fitch calculates that funding costs for Asia Pacific junk-rated corporate issuers have risen by more than 1 percentage point to 7.5% by end-September.

The 50 major Asian high-yield corporate issuers - who have $423 billion in debt outstanding between them - might enjoy a bit of breathing space for now with just $2.6 billion maturing until year-end, Fitch calculates.

But that will soon change when a record $28.2 billion comes due in 2022 followed by $28.7 billion in 2023, the ratings agency said in its latest report.

The group is dominated by China and the real estate sector, but also contains firms from India and Malaysia to Mongolia.

Fitch cost of funding APAC high yield

Analysts also predict the latest events will sharpen a push by investors for more favourable conditions.

""The lasting impact in terms of pricing might come in the form of investor insistence on improved company transparency and disclosures,"" said Jim Veneau, AXA Investment Management head of Asia fixed income.

Philip Lee, head of debt capital markets for Asia Pacific at DLA Piper, expects to see ""demand for tighter covenants in bond documentation as well as greater focus on group guarantees and asset security.

Given the sheer size of China's bond market at $16 trillion, comparatively high yields and increasing importance in global indexes and financial markets, some bet that investors will see through the current turmoil in the near future.

This month will see the start of the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in the FTSE Russell WGBI index - a widely followed fixed income benchmark - that could see large amounts of passive investments flow into the country's debt markets.

""In the long-term, we believe this market is simply too vast to ignore,"" said PineBridge's Lau.

NewsApi.org,"* Turkish lira hits new low, among worst EM performers this week

* Russian rouble trades around 3-month highs

* Chinese property stocks, bonds gain

Oct 22 (Reuters) - Most emerging market stocks and currencies rose on Friday, after a report said that debt-ridden developer China Evergrande Group had made some headway in interest payments, while Russia’s rouble rose ahead of an interest rate decision.

However, most EM assets were also set for mild weekly gains amid growing expectations that central banks would act to stave off rising inflation.

MSCI’s index of EM stocks rose 0.2%, while currencies added 0.1%.

Shares of China Evergrande rose 4.7%, with dollar-denominated bonds of property developers rallying after Reuters reported that the embattled real estate firm had supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond.

The news helped clear some fears of an imminent default in China’s massive property sector, which investors fear could spill over to debt markets across the globe. Analysts speculated whether the bond payment was merely delaying an inevitable default.

The Chinese yuan gained slightly on the news.

Russia’s rouble rose 0.2% to around three-month highs against the dollar, as markets expected the central bank to raise rates from 6.75%.

Rising inflation is expected to force the bank’s hand, although analysts were split over a 25 basis point (bp) or 50 bp hike, given that bank has already raised rates sharply this year.

“Even though consumer price index inflation is running above the central bank’s forecast for this year, it does not necessarily jeopardize the achievement of its 4.0% target next year,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.

“We think the central bank will likely hike the policy rate by 25bps, although the decision will be a close call.”

Turkey’s lira slumped more than 1% to a record low of 9.6581 to the dollar, and was among the worst performing EM currencies this week after the central bank cut rates by twice as much as expected on Thursday.

Sentiment over Turkey was further hit by an international watchdog downgrading the country to a grey list for failing to head off money laundering and terrorist financing.

Under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan to ease policy despite high inflation, the bank lowered its repo rate to 16%, bringing the cuts in the last month to 300 basis points in moves which have driven a sustained decline in the Turkish currency’s value.

Most central European currencies retreated to the euro. Poland’s zloty fell 0.2% as central banker Rafal Sura said interest rates should rise to pre-pandemic levels, but declined to say when he would vote for a further hike.

HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) has supplied funds to pay interest on a dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default. read more

Here is a timeline of events of how Evergrande's debt crisis has unfolded:

August 2020

Regulators meet with Evergrande and other big developers to introduce caps for three debt ratios in a scheme dubbed ""the three red lines"".

Evergrande sells a $3 billion stake in its property management unit ahead of the unit's IPO. It asks Guangdong's provincial government to approve a Shenzhen backdoor listing plan that has languished for four years, saying it could face a cash crunch.

September 2020

Evergrande offers 30% discounts on properties for a month to push sales.

October 2020

Evergrande raises $555 million in a slimmed-down secondary share sale in Hong Kong.

November 2020

Evergrande terminates the Shenzhen backdoor listing plan. Some strategic investors agree not to demand repayment.

Evergrande Property Services Group's (6666.HK) Hong Kong IPO raises $1.8 billion.

January 2021

China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group (0708.HK) raises $3.4 billion by bringing in six new investors.

March 2021

Evergrande sells a $2.10 billion stake in online real estate and automobile marketplace Fangchebao to 17 investors in a pre-IPO deal. It aims to meet its three debt-ratio caps by year's end, list Fangchebao by early next year and spin off several units.

June 2021

Evergrande says it will sell a $386 million stake in peer China Calxon Group (000918.SZ).

The developer arranges HK$13.6 billion ($1.75 billion) to repay a maturing bond and interest on dollar bonds.

Evergrande achieves one debt cap, cutting interest-bearing debt to around 570 billion yuan from 716.5 billion yuan six months earlier.

July 2021

A court orders a freeze on a 132 million yuan bank deposit held by Evergrande at the request of China Guangfa Bank (GDDVB.UL). Evergrande says the loan is not due until March and it plans to take legal action.

Some banks in Hong Kong decline to extend new loans to buyers of two of Evergrande's uncompleted residential projects.

August 2021

Evergrande agrees to sell stakes in internet unit HengTen Networks Group (0136.HK) worth HK$3.25 billion ($418 million).

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court centralises lawsuits against Evergrande nationwide, sources say.

Evergrande says it is in talks to sell stakes in Evergrande New Energy Vehicle and Evergrande Property Services.

State media reports construction has been halted on two Evergrande projects in Kunming, one for overdue payments.

Hui Ka Yan steps down as chairman of flagship unit Hengda Real Estate Group.

China's central bank and banking watchdog summon senior executives, issuing a rare warning that Evergrande must reduce its debt risk and prioritise stability.

Evergrande warns of liquidity and default risks if it fails to resume construction, dispose of assets and renew loans, as it reports a 29% year-on-year decline in net profit.

September 2021

Chairman Hui promises buyers Evergrande will complete construction of their homes.

It requests extension on trust-loan interest payments to creditors including CITIC Trust.

Hui vows to repay all of Evergrande's matured wealth management products as soon as possible. Investors crowd the lobby of Evergrande's Shenzhen headquarters to demand repayment of loans.

Evergrande says online speculation about bankruptcy and restructuring was ""totally untrue"" but acknowledges ""unprecedented difficulties"".

It says it has engaged financial advisers to examine its options, warning of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales.

Hui says helping retail investors redeem investment products is a top priority.

Evergrande says it had ""resolved"" a coupon payment on an onshore bond but then misses payments on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29 deadlines to pay $131 million dollar coupons.

Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK), Evergrande's second-biggest shareholder, says it plans to exit its holding. The EV unit warns it faces an uncertain future unless it gets a swift cash injection.

Evergrande says it will raise 9.99 billion yuan selling Shengjing Bank (2066.HK) shares.

October 2021

Advisers of some Evergrande dollar bondholders, investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, say they want more information and transparency.

Evergrande misses $148 million in coupon payments due Oct. 11.

Hong Kong's audit regulator says it is investigating Evergrande's 2020 accounts and audit by PwC.

Reuters reports state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building.

Evergrande pays a 121.8 million yuan onshore bond coupon, sources say.

China's vice premier, central bank and banking and securities watchdogs seek to reassure markets that spillover effects on the banking system and real estate sector from Evergrande's debt problems are controllable.

Evergrande abandons plans to sell a $2.6 billion stake in the services unit to rival Hopson Development Holdings (0754.HK).

A defaulted private bond guaranteed by Evergrande, Jumbo Fortune Bond, secures a three-month-plus extension, REDD reports.

Evergrande remits funds for a dollar bond coupon that was due Sept. 23 to avoid default before the 30-day grace period expires, a source says.

NewsApi.org,"Evergrande 's unraveling is still commanding global attention, but its troubles are part of a much bigger problem.

For weeks, the ailing Chinese real estate conglomerate has made headlines as investors wait to see what will happen to its enormous mountain of debt . As the slow-moving crisis unfolds, analysts are pointing to a deeper underlying issue: China's property market is cooling off after years of oversupply.

Chinese authorities finally weighed in on the Evergrande crisis on Friday. The People's Bank of China said the company had mismanaged its business but risks to the financial system were ""controllable.""

""In recent years, the company has failed to manage its business well and to operate in accordance with market changes,"" Zou Lan, director of the financial market department at the Chinese central bank, said at a press briefing. ""Instead, it blindly diversified and expanded, resulting in serious deterioration of its operating and financial indicators, which eventually led to risks.""

The warning signs have been flashing for some time. Prior to Evergrande's meltdown, tens of millions of apartments were thought to be sitting empty across the country. In recent years, the problem has only gotten worse.

Residential buildings seen in Beijing on Sept. 17, 2021. ""Residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,"" according to one economist.

Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, estimates that China still has about 30 million unsold properties, which could house 80 million people. That's nearly the entire population of Germany.

On top of that, about 100 million properties have likely been bought but not occupied, which could accommodate roughly 260 million people, according to Capital Economics estimates. Such projects have attracted scrutiny for years, and even been dubbed China's ""ghost towns.""

Here's a look at some of those projects, and how the problem first originated.

A worker installing safety netting at an apartment block under construction in the Nanchuan area of Xining, Qinghai province, China, on Sept. 28, 2021.

Real estate and related sectors are a massive part of China's economy, accounting for as much as 30% of GDP. The proportion of economic output related to construction and adjacent activities is ""far higher than in other major economies,"" according to Williams.

For decades, that has helped the country sustain rapid economic growth.

But for years, critics have questioned whether that engine of growth was creating a ticking time bomb for the world's second largest economy. That's in part because of the massive debt many developers took on to finance their projects.

As China's most indebted developer, Evergrande has become the poster child of unsustainable growth, with more than $300 billion worth of liabilities.

In a recent report, Zhu wrote that 12 Chinese real estate firms defaulted on bond payments totaling about 19.2 billion yuan (nearly $3 billion) in the first half of the year.

""This accounted for near 20% of total corporate bond defaults in the first six months of the year, the highest across all sectors"" in mainland China, she added.

The pandemic brought activity to a temporary standstill. But construction later roared back to life as China reopened, and the country's property market enjoyed a brief rebound.

Since then, however, the market has sputtered again. And there's no sign of immediate relief.

Over the last few months, ""measures of price growth, housing [construction] starts and sales"" have tapered off considerably, Zhu noted. In August, property sales, as measured by floor space sold, dropped 18% compared to the same time the previous year, she added.

That same month, new home prices edged up 3.5% ""from a year earlier, the smallest growth since the property market rebounded from the pandemic fallout in June 2020,"" wrote Zhu.

""Residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,"" Williams wrote in a research note. He called this ""the root of Evergrande's troubles — and those of other highly-leveraged developers.""

Then there is the problem of unfinished projects, even if there is demand. The majority of new properties in China — about 90% — are sold before being completed, meaning that any setbacks for home builders could directly impact buyers, according to economists.

""[This] gives the authorities a strong incentive to ensure that ongoing projects continue as failing developers are restructured,"" said Williams.

According to recent analysis from Bank of America, Evergrande has sold 200,000 housing units that have not yet been handed over to buyers. That has exacerbated fears that home buyers may be left empty-handed by the country's second biggest developer

In recent weeks, the government has turned its focus to limiting fallout from the crisis and protecting ordinary people. In a statement late last month that did not refer specifically to Evergrande, the People's Bank of China vowed to ""maintain the healthy development of the real estate market, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of housing consumers.""

Zou, the central bank official, said Friday that Evergrande was an isolated phenomenon.

""The domestic real estate market has maintained stable land prices, housing prices, and expectations. Most real estate companies operate steadily and have good financial indicators. The real estate industry is generally healthy,"" he told reporters.

It's true that not all real estate companies are in dire straits. While some players are clearly struggling, ""most developers are not on the brink of default,"" according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.

""With a couple of exceptions, most major developers are in a much stronger financial position than Evergrande and should be able to weather a temporary spike in their borrowing costs amid contagion fears,"" he said in a note to clients. That should provide some reassurance ""amid the current market jitters,"" at least in the short term, he added.

But in the long run, it may matter little.

""Successfully navigating the structural decline in housing demand over the coming decade will prove more challenging,"" wrote Evans-Pritchard. ""A drawn-out consolidation of the sector over many years seems more likely than an imminent wave of developer failures.""

HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - What to say to a friend whose troubles give you an opportunity? Evergrande’s (3333.HK) shares are suspended while a rival eyes taking a $5 billion majority stake in the ailing developer’s property management unit, Chinese media reported. read more Now tycoon Joseph Lau has launched a $250 million buyout bid for the 25% his family doesn’t already own in Chinese Estates (0127.HK). Its shares have been beaten down by its close ties to Evergrande boss Hui Ka Yan, a poker buddy of Lau. Sellers in each case are looking at strong hands that they’ll have little choice but to fold on.

Lau and wife Chan Hoi-wan are offering HK$4 a share for the rump stake in Chinese Estates, valuing the Hong Kong and London-focused property developer at $979 million. The offer price is final. That’s a 38% premium to the last price before their suspension last week. They had been hovering at a 12-year low and are down two-fifths this year alone.

Evergrande’s woes are the prime cause of Chinese Estates’ downtrodden stock. Its holdings of its rival’s shares and bonds accounted for a third of its total assets last year. Such is loyalty among friends: Evergrande bought its 25-storey Hong Kong headquarters from Lau in 2016 at what was generally considered an above-market price.

Yet Lau and Chan would be getting a bargain since their offer represents a whopping 69% discount to the company’s June 30 net asset value. Say it sold its remaining Evergrande shares at the current price, that would still leave the offer valued at a 47% discount, per Breakingviews calculations. When fellow tycoon Gordon Wu privatised $4 billion Hopewell Holdings in 2019, that deal’s 43% NAV discount was considered eye-wateringly large.

Evergrande itself has little more wiggle room. Its shares and those of its property management unit were suspended on Monday, as was the stock of Hopson Development (0754.HK), another mainland developer, which is regarded as the potential bidder for 51% of the division.

On the face of it, that’s a 44% premium to its shares, if the reports are correct. Cash-strapped Evergrande should be happy with that. Lau’s minority shareholders can’t do much about the price, but they could call his bluff and block the deal. Bottom-feeding is shrewd enough, but the spoils could be more widely shared.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Developer Chinese Estates on Oct. 6 announced that tycoon Joseph Lau has offered HK$4 a share for the 25% stake in the company his family does not already own. It values the chunk held by minority investors at HK$1.9 billion ($245 million).

- The price represents a 38% premium to the Hong Kong-based firm’s last price on Sept. 30, when the shares were suspended pending news.

- Shares in Lau’s firm recently hit their lowest in more than a decade, largely because of its long-running close links with troubled fellow developer, Evergrande.

HONG KONG, Oct 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Add disagreement over a deal’s collapse to the growing list of China Evergrande’s (3333.HK) woes. The cash-crunched developer chaired by Hui Ka Yan revealed late on Wednesday that it had cancelled a proposed sale to Hopson Development (0754.HK) of a 50.1% stake in its property management unit for $2.6 billion after its sources said the buyer had not met the necessary prerequisites.

Hopson’s account is markedly different. The $8 billion company says it refused to accept Evergrande’s request to be paid the sale proceeds directly. That ran counter to the agreement Hopson struck to hand over only the difference between the sale price and what Evergrande owes its subsidiary, for fear it wouldn’t get the funds otherwise. Evergrande Property Services’ (6666.HK) latest accounts put that sum at around $370 million, equivalent to 90% of its 2020 net profit.

Hopson shares rose 5% on the news, while Evergrande stock fell by a tenth. Shareholders seem to think Hopson had a point. It’s a potent warning to any other bidders. (By Jennifer Hughes)

“We’ve lots of earnings beats on lowered expectations, and then you’re getting comments from CEOs suggesting supply chains are damaged - but certain firms have said that they’re on top of it,” said Keith Temperton, sales trader at Forte Securities. “That’s hopeful for the markets.”

A bunch of upbeat earnings lifted Wall Street’s S&P 500 to a record high, while its European counterpart is less than 1% shy of its August peak.

Europe Inc is expected to see a 47.6% rise in third-quarter profit to 96.1 billion euros ($112 billion), latest data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S showed, a slight improvement from last week’s 46.7% growth forecast.

“That inflation is transitory does not necessarily mean that it is short-lived. An adjustment of supply to the changes in patterns of demand caused by the pandemic may be slow, and keep upward pressure on prices for longer,” strategists at Citi wrote in a note.

Summary Tech shares follow U.S. peers higher on FAANG earnings optimism

Evergrande set to avert default after surprise interest payment

Energy shares slump with markets bracing for higher inflation

TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Tech stocks climbed in Asia on Friday, following U.S. peers higher, while Chinese property stocks rallied following a surprise interest payment by debt-ridden property developer China Evergrande Group.

Meanwhile, energy stocks dragged following a pullback in oil prices overnight, and as coal futures extended losses after Beijing signalled it would intervene to cool surging prices that contributed to the country's electricity shortage.

More broadly, investors have become increasingly concerned that persistent inflation could force central bankers to tighten monetary policy at a point where global economic growth remains fragile.

Regional bond yields rose with those on U.S. Treasuries, where the market priced in higher inflation expectations by narrowing the spread between short- and long-term yields, and pushing breakeven rates to the highest since 2012.

The dollar held gains from overnight - when it rose the most since the start of last week against major peers - as better jobs data boosted the case for a faster tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus and earlier interest rate hikes.

Japan's Nikkei (.N225) advanced 0.3%, led by technology shares, while energy and basic materials shares were the biggest drags. The broader Topix (.TOPX) ended the day 0.1% higher, with a 0.4% jump in the Topix growth index (.TOPXG) mostly negated by a 0.2% drop for the value index (.TOPXV).

Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) gained 0.7%, with the CSI300 Real Estate Index (.CSI000952) rising 2.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (.HSI) rose 0.1%, as an index tracking Hong Kong-listed mainland developers (.HSMPI) rallied 3.4%.

China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) wired funds to a trustee account on Thursday for a dollar bond interest payment due Sept. 23, a source told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have plunged the embattled developer into formal default. The stock jumped 3.5%. read more

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) edged up slightly, keeping it on track for a 1.6% gain this week. That would be a third straight winning week, the longest stretch since early June.

Futures pointed to a higher open in Europe, with FTSE futures indicating a 0.3% rise and DAX futures signaling a 0.3% advance.

By contrast, S&P 500 E-minis futures pointed to a 0.1% drop at the re-open, after the cash index posted a record closing high overnight, led by surging tech shares.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) added 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) rallied 0.6%, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) edged slightly lower.

Next week, almost all the so-called FAANG giants report earnings: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google-owner Alphabet. Netflix (NFLX.O) posted its results on Oct.19, and for the quarter that ended in September, diluted earnings-per-share came in at $3.19, beating analyst expectations of $2.57. read more

""The narrative over the last couple of days has been earnings focused and tech stocks have led the charge,"" said Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Australia.

""There's momentum there, simple as that.""

At the other end, energy shares were the biggest drag on indexes from Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Chinese coal prices continued to dive after the government said it would intervene to cool prices to help electricity producers out of a widespread power crunch. read more

Oil prices also fell, with Brent set for its first losing week in seven, and West Texas Intermediate crude down for the first week in nine, following a retreat from multi-year highs reached earlier in the week.

Brent slid 0.7% to $84.03, while WTI dropped 0.6% to $82.03.

""The crude price and energy more broadly has had a pretty good run,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.

""I don't think people are giving up on energy necessarily, but I think people are thinking it's time to switch out of what's been a very hot sector.""

Meanwhile, yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were at 1.6802%, easing back from a five-month high of 1.7050% reached overnight. Two-year yields at 0.4513% remained close to the overnight high of 0.4560%, a level not seen since March of last year.

The dollar index , which gauges the greenback against six major rivals, edged higher to 93.755 on Friday, adding to the previous session's 0.2% gain.

The index bounced off its lowest this month overnight after data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low last week, pointing to a tighter labor market. read more

The Fed has signaled it could start to taper stimulus as soon as next month, with rate hikes following late next year. Full employment is among the Fed's stated requirements for rates lift-off.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks later on Friday in a panel discussion.

China property stocks rally on surprise Evergrande payment

Cyclical shares slump as markets price for higher inflation

TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Tech stocks climbed in Asia on Friday, following U.S. peers higher, while Chinese property stocks rallied following a surprise interest payment by debt-ridden property developer China Evergrande Group.

Meanwhile cyclical stocks dragged amid worries that central bankers will need to tighten monetary policy into slowing growth in order to tackle persistent inflation.

Regional bond yields rose with those on U.S. Treasuries, where the market priced in higher inflation by narrowing the spread between short- and long-term yields, and pushing breakeven rates to the highest since 2012.

The dollar held gains from overnight - when it rose the most since the start of last week against major peers - as better jobs and housing data boosted the case for a faster tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus and earlier interest rate hikes.

Japan's Nikkei (.N225) rose 0.7% led by technology shares, while energy shares were the biggest drag. The broader Topix (.TOPX) added 0.3%, with a 0.6% jump in the Topix growth index (.TOPXG) handily outpacing a 0.1% advance for the value index (.TOPXV).

BEIJING/HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Some Chinese property developers have proposed extending their offshore bond maturities or undertaking a debt restructuring in a meeting with regulators, sources said, as a wave of defaults shakes investor confidence in the sector.

The meeting underlines the behind-the-scenes efforts by China's debt-laden developers and regulators to contain the fallout centred around embattled China Evergrande Group (3333.HK). read more

The developers made the proposals at a meeting jointly held by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because of its sensitivity. SAFE and NDRC did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

It was not immediately clear which developers made the proposals, and what decision the regulators would settle on.

The regulators, however, told developers facing large offshore debt maturities to evaluate their repayment risks and report difficulties, the sources said.

The regulators also asked the unnamed companies in the meeting to proactively prepare for repayment of both principal and interest on their foreign bonds and to ""jointly maintain their own reputations and the overall order of the market,"" NDRC said in a statement late on Tuesday.

Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, fuelling worries about the impact of its fate on the world's second-largest economy and on global markets.

Evergrande narrowly averted a costly default last week by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond, boosting confidence the company may be able to avoid a messy collapse.

The developer now needs to find $47.5 million by Friday, and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.

Broader concerns about China's real estate sector, which accounts for a quarter of its gross domestic product, still loom large for investors and Chinese policymakers.

The meeting with the regulators took place in Beijing on Tuesday against the backdrop of several bond defaults in the sector. Developers Fantasia Holdings Group (1777.HK), Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) and Modern Land (1107.HK) all defaulted on their maturing dollar bonds this month.

""Developers were asked to report in great details about all their offshore bond repayment plans; they need to voice out if there are particular payments (for which) they're seeing some difficulties in repayment,"" one of the sources said.

Rating agency S&P said on Wednesday defaults in the Chinese property sector are rising, with some $84 billion of onshore and offshore bonds due over the next five quarters and the first peak of debt payments due in January 2022.

MARKET ORDER

Steven Leung, director of brokerage UOB Kay Hian based in Hong Kong, said that by initiating this kind of meeting with developers, regulators were sending a positive signal to the market that they are handling the risks.

""When NDRC is involved, there may be even a chance that the primary bond market can be active again, giving opportunities to better quality developers to refinance,"" he said, adding that extending maturities can ease some liquidity pressure.

But restructuring lawyers said extending maturities was a complex process that required quid-pro-quo from the borrowers.

""The extension of maturities in bonds isn't an easy process, especially not if they are widely held. In practice it may be very difficult to do so,"" said Alexander Aitken, partner at Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong.

Karl Clowry, partner at Addleshaw Goddard in London, said any extension request in a restructuring would normally be accompanied by certain milestones – like access to books and records, management, maybe performance milestones in terms of turning a business around or preserving money.

""In China sponsors are just not used to creditors having any influence until a company is in a procedure,"" he said, referring to processes such as insolvency or restructuring proceedings.

A total of eight developers including Kaisa Group (1638.HK), Shimao (0813.HK) and Sino-Ocean Group (3377.HK) attended the meeting on Tuesday, financial media outlet Caixin reported on Wednesday.

China Vanke (000002.SZ), Central China Real Estate (0832.HK) and Oceanwide Holdings (000046.SZ) were also among the attendees, the two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

Vanke declined to comment. Kaisa confirmed its participation in the meeting, without further elaboration. Central China, Oceanwide, Shimao and Sino-Ocean Group did not respond to request for comment.

Shares of Evergrande ended down 0.8%, while its electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd (0708.HK) rose 5.1% on Wednesday. The Hang Seng Index (.HIS) ended 1.6% lower.

Company chairman Hui Ka Yan reportedly said on Friday it would make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business, instead of property, within 10 years.

Evergrande said on Tuesday it has resumed work on some projects in the Pearl River Delta region and it would deliver 31 real estate projects by the end of 2021. That number will rise to 40 by the end of June 2022.

Many of Evergrande's construction projects across the country have been suspended as it was unable to pay contractors. The developer has some 1,300 real estate projects across China.

HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) has supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default.

Shares of Evergrande, which is saddled with more than $300 billion in liabilities, rose as much as 8% early on Friday, and were still up more than 4% at noon.

Here is what people are saying about the world's most indebted developer, whose fate could ripple through global markets.

PAUL LUKASZEWSKI, HEAD OF CORPORATE DEBT, ASIA PACIFIC, ABRDN, SINGAPORE

""Evergrande making its interest payment is a positive surprise. Importantly other developers also confirmed making interest payments – for a market which has fully capitulated, the fact the world did not end overnight could itself be a positive catalyst.

""The main takeaway for Evergrande's creditors is that they are all being treated the same; everyone is being kept current as the company has avoided a formal default for the time being.

""Multiple financing channels are effectively closed to developers in response to the policies implemented by the government. For those channels to reopen, investors have to believe these companies can remain going concerns. This means they need to have sufficient access to their own cash flows and to refinancing options to address their debt as it becomes due.""

DICKIE WONG, KINGSTON SECURITIES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HONG KONG

""Even though Evergrande has paid the coupon for the U.S. denominate bond, well never say never, maybe on the next one they will default. There is still a very high default risk for the U.S. bonds, in the next couple of months.

""Chinese policy will not allow property developers to dump their properties at low prices and not allow an overheating or bubble in the market as well. In the longer term, I don't see much upside for the sector and investors are better off avoiding the developers that have already hit the three red lines.""

JEFFREY HALLEY, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ASIA PACIFIC, OANDA, SINGAPORE

""China, in the bigger picture, although they don't want to be seen to bail out Evergrande for a whole bunch of reasons ... like HNA they'll be looking to do an orderly wind down. We've got the central committee meeting in early November, and the last thing they'd want is a disorderly collapse of Evergrande ahead of that meeting, especially when President Xi is talking about shared prosperity, Evergrande does employ 1.5 million people directly or indirectly, so that wouldn't be a good look on that front if it was allowed to fall into a disorderly collapse.""

""I think this will be a short-term positive, I'm just not sure how long that momentum will last, whether it carries into next week or not. There are so many different possibilities for the way that this story could evolve it's really hard to predict what's going to happen.

""And I think because of that it will still be a headwind for China markets because there's just so many variables, so many ways this story could wash out... I think this will be a short-term positive but I don't think this will change the overarching fears about what the true state of the sector or the China economy is at the moment.""

CHUANYI ZHOU, CREDIT ANALYST AT LUCROR ANALYTICS, SINGAPORE

""It is a boost to investor confidence for both Evergrande and the other Chinese property USD bonds, especially in terms of willingness to pay. That said, Evergrande has more payments coming up. We wait to see if the company is able to fulfil the obligations.""

KENNY NG, EVERBRIGHT SUN HUNG KAI ANALYST, HONG KONG

""I think investors should not be overly optimistic about this. After all, Evergrande will still have many debts to be repaid in the short term in the future, and its fundamentals such as sales situation have not seen any obvious signs of improvement for the time being. At the same time, the current price of Evergrande’s bonds still reflects the lack of confidence in the market for its future.

""Therefore, the rebound of Evergrande's share price may be just a short-term performance, and investors should adopt a cautious attitude.""

JACKSON CHAN, ASSISTANT MANAGER OF FIXED INCOME RESEARCH AT BONDSUPERMART, HONG KONG

“It is not really surprising news for us, as we can expect that from the previous moves from Evergrande, including the three-month maturity extension of its Jumbo Fortune bond and a coupon repayment on its onshore bond which was settled in cash. It is obvious that they want to avoid near-term bonds default that could allow creditors to claim against and liquidate its offshore and onshore assets.

""The company may pay the remaining coupons on the last day of each bond's grace period. But is it good news for bondholders? At this point it is unclear, because this move further buys time for the company to sell their assets, which can eat into the recovery value of the bonds if they default eventually. Therefore, at this moment, we do not see the market reacted very positively towards this news.”

HONG HAO, BOCOM HEAD OF RESEARCH, HONG KONG

""It's not a surprise that Evergrande has made the payment in the grace period, but it is one of many obstacles that it is facing. There are many, many liabilities that are due. The deal with Hopson to sell the property services company has fallen through, so they still have to come up with money somehow.

""If you look at the 'three red lines' policy released last year, there are a number of developers that fall into the red zone, and it is these developers which are seeing problems right now. I think we will see more default events coming through.""

WEI LIANG CHANG, MACRO STRATEGIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE

""In the short term, we believe the interest repayment should provide a fillip to Chinese risk assets, including the yuan and Chinese equities. Evergrande default risks, though not dissipated, have likely been deferred for some time.""

CASTOR PANG, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT CORE PACIFIC, HONG KONG

""The market is in ‘wait and see’ because Evergrande still has a large pile of debt with the next batch of default dates coming up soon. Its liquidity is so bad it’s questionable whether it can repay other debts.

""Its sale of the services unit failed and its September and October sales were getting worse and worse. It has very little cash. This repayment also doesn’t lift the sentiment of the sector, because those companies in cash crunch will still be struggling. The situation doesn’t change unless PBOC loosen more credits.""

MOH SIONG SIM, CURRENCY ANALYST, BANK OF SINGAPORE

""There is still a lot of scepticism. Bond prices have not picked up a lot. It's a situation where they'll try to keep it going until they can't.

""What's important is the property market, because they have a lot of projects under construction and the worst scenario would be if they go down and projects are left unfinished and that creates spillover for the economy. They have bought themselves some time.""

GARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG

""That Evergrande is able to fulfil its obligation after the grace period on the offshore bond is positive at least in the short term as it shows a certain commitment from the firm and provides a relief for offshore bond investors.

""However, they still have a bunch of deadlines coming up before the end of March. To fulfil all the obligations and the bond coupon payments they still need liquidity either from themselves or from offloading assets. Even though Evergrande managed to repay the coupon this time, it’s still quite challenging for them to meet all their future obligations.""

TRAVIS LUNDY, QUIDDITY ADVISORS ANALYST, HONG KONG

""I expect it means they also plan to pay the offshore bond coupons due by the 29th. There's no point in paying this one if you fully plan on not paying the next one six days later, but given the company's self-reported cashflow difficulties, it is not clear how long they can keep that up.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term. And I expect Hopson's clarified response yesterday means lawsuits if Evergrande tries to sell Evergrande Property Services to someone else.""

HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Shares in China Evergrande Group's electric vehicles (EV) unit <0708.HK> rose on Monday as the embattled property developer moved to prioritise the growth of its nascent EV business over its troubled core real estate operations.

Evergrande (3333.HK) , reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, averted a costly default last week with a last-minute bond coupon payment, buying it more time to head off a looming debt crunch with its next major payment deadline on Friday. read more

An announcement by its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, reported by state media on Friday, that it would make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business, instead of property, within 10 years, cheered investors on Monday.

Evergrande rose as much as 6% during the session before closing down 0.7%. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd (0708.HK)rose 11.4%. The benchmark Heng Seng Index (.HSI) was flat.

Raymond Cheng, CGS-CIMB Securities' head of China research, said the business shift makes sense given Beijing's growing support for EVs and its increased tightening of the frothy real estate sector.

""This is the best outcome, if it just focuses on existing developments and maintains the operation,"" Cheng said.

While the move would help Evergrande deleverage by gradually scaling down its massive undeveloped land holdings, Cheng said it was unclear how it would affect the company's planned disposals including stakes in the EV unit.

Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.

Hui expects property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year within the 10-year period, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, China's Securities Times reported on Friday.

NEXT HURDLES

News late last week that Evergrande had averted a default by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond has lifted confidence the company may be able to avoid a messy collapse that would have significant ramifications for global financial markets.

On Monday, sources told Reuters some bondholders had received coupon payments they were owed last week, which suggested debt problems were being addressed.

Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Friday and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.

Broader concerns about China's real estate sector, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product, still loom large for investors and policymakers in the world's second-largest economy.

Developer Modern Land (1107.HK) has a $250 million bond maturing on Monday. It said last week it ended an attempt to seek bondholder approval to extend the maturity date of the notes by three months, citing liquidity issues.

Calls to Modern Land's investor relations office were not answered when Reuters sought comment on whether the payment has been made.

As liquidity concerns in the sector grow, property firms with large dollar-denominated debts will meet with the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing on Tuesday to report their total issuance volume and repayment capability, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Media outlet Cailianshe first reported the meeting earlier on Monday.

Separately, Evergrande said on Sunday work had resumed on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen. Many of its projects had been halted due to payments owed to suppliers and contractors. read more

Also lifting general confidence, state media outlet Xinhua in an article on Monday said the spillover effect of Chinese real estate companies' debt default risks to the financial industry would be controllable. read more

The report follows comments from senior officials including Vice Premier Liu He and central bank governor Yi Gang last week, who also said property companies were facing debt default issues because of poor management and a failure to adjust to market changes. read more

HONG KONG, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Two Hong Kong property agencies are suing heavily indebted China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) over unpaid commissions, according to a court filing and media reports, piling pressure on the developer as it scrambles to raise funds and avert a collapse.

Centaline filed a suit against Evergrande in September to recover HK$3.1 million ($398,196) in overdue commissions, a court filing showed, while the South China Morning Post newspaper reported Midland Holdings (1200.HK) is claiming unpaid commission of HK$43.45 million for two developments in Hong Kong.

An executive at Centaline China told Reuters they have also filed a suit against Evergrande in a Guangzhou court in southern China, seeking to claim hundreds of millions of yuan it says it is due.

Centaline confirmed to Reuters it filed a claim in Hong Kong last month, but declined to comment further. Midland declined to comment, saying the case was going through legal procedures. Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hong Kong's exposure to debt-laden developer China Evergrande is ""very minimal"" at 0.05%, or HK$14 billion ($1.79 billion) of banking assets and will not cause any systemic risks, the newspaper reported on Sunday, citing the city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan. read more

Evergrande has vowed to repay its suppliers and contractors in mainland China as soon as possible, in some cases offering apartments or other real estate assets, as construction at many of its sites have halted because of delayed payments.

With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its cash crunch could spread through China's financial system and reverberate globally, a worry that has eased with the Chinese central bank's vow last week to protect homebuyers' interests. read more

Growing worries about defaults at Chinese property developers triggered a rout in their shares and bonds on Tuesday with fresh credit rating downgrades and uncertainty about the fate of cash-strapped China Evergrande Group sapping investor sentiment. read more

Last month it missed coupon payments on two dollar bond tranches and is scrambling to sell assets to pay creditors, prioritising repayment to onshore lenders in the last few weeks.

Evergrande Unit Says on Track for Project Delivery, Coupon in Focus

Article content (Bloomberg) — Some investors received a coupon payment on a China Evergrande Group dollar bond before a grace period ended Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The initial deadline was Sept. 23, which passed with no sign that investors had been paid. At least two holders of the 8.25% dollar note maturing in March 2022 received the payment, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Prices of these and other Evergrande notes rose Monday, though they’re still deep in distressed territory. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Article content Meanwhile, shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, the real-estate company’s electric-vehicle unit, climbed more than 11% on Monday after Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan said making such cars would become its main business within a decade. The reported shift to the electric-car business will be a challenge given that Evergrande has yet to deliver a single vehicle, despite Hui’s ambitions to take on industry giants such as Tesla Inc. The world’s most indebted developer is struggling with a cash crisis that has led it to consider selling stakes in units including Evergrande NEV. Focus now turns to the end of a grace period on another Evergrande dollar bond later this week. Any reprieve from debt payments may be short-lived as the embattled developer still has more than $300 billion in liabilities.

HONG KONG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy China Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation, two sources said.

The collapse of the talks for the landmark building's sale is another setback for cash-strapped Evergrande which has been scrambling to divest some assets to repay creditors knocking on its doors. With more than $300 billion in liabilities, it has already missed three rounds of interest payments on its international bonds. read more

Yuexiu, based in the southern city of Guangzhou, was close to sealing a deal in August to acquire the 26-storey China Evergrande Centre in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district that serves as Evergrande's local headquarters, said the sources.

The deal, however, faltered after Yuexiu's board opposed the move over worries that Evergrande's unresolved indebtedness would create potential complications in completing the transaction smoothly, they said.

Once China's top-selling developer, Shenzhen-based Evergrande has in recent months sought to raise funds by offloading assets - from properties to stakes in subsidiaries - both in mainland China and in Hong Kong.

Evergrande,which saw its 8.75% June 2025 bond fall more than 6% to 18.625 cents on Friday, did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Yuexiu.

The people declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.

Evergrande bought the harbourside building, which is located in Hong Kong's commercial and night life district and covers an area of 345,000 square feet, from local peer Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK) for HK$12.5 billion ($1.61 billion) in 2015.

That deal set a record for a single transaction of a commercial building in the Asian financial hub with the highest price per square foot at the time. It also made the property Evergrande's single largest asset in the city.

Evergrande has financed the bulk of the transaction with securitised products worth more than HK$10 billion, said one of the sources, which means it would only recoup limited cash from the sale of the building.

EVERGRANDE PROSPECTS

The board of Yuexiu, which focuses on property developments in China's Greater Bay Area and has a presence in Hong Kong, became concerned about the deal's certainty at a time when Evergrande's future is uncertain, said one of the sources.

Yuexiu also received guidance from the municipal government of the southern city of Guangzhou to put the purchase on hold at the end of August, said the person.

A separate source familiar with the matter said the deal was halted in late August because the Guangzhou government wanted to review the overall financial situation of Evergrande first to better understand the use of proceeds from its asset disposals.

The Guangzhou government did not respond to a request for comment.

Separately, Evergrande is in final talks to sell a 51% stake in its property management arm Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK) to domestic peer Hopson Development (0754.HK), in a deal that could fetch about HK$20 billion, said two of the sources.

One of them said both parties are finalising details including financing for the buyer.

When asked about the deal, Hopson said any comments will have to wait till an announcement is made.

The Hopson deal would be Evergrande's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead. The struggling developer's other business interests include a bottling water company and an electric vehicle maker.

It is also close to selling its Guangzhou FC Soccer stadium and surrounding residential projects to Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group, Reuters reported last month. read more

NewsApi.org,"People stand near a bank's electronic board at Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Oct. 4, 2021.Vincent Yu/The Associated Press

China Evergrande Group halted trading of its shares on Monday amid news it had missed another key bond interest payment, bringing the beleaguered Chinese real estate giant closer to default.

The world’s most indebted property developer, Evergrande has been teetering on the edge of collapse for weeks now, as it struggles to address almost US$305-billion in liabilities, much of which is offshore. The company’s debts are equal to 2 per cent of China’s total GDP, sparking fears that a collapse could spread through the financial system and reverberate around the world – though worries have eased somewhat after the central bank vowed to protect homebuyers’ interests.

A potential means of doing so emerged Monday, as it was reported that fellow Guangdong-based property developer Hopson Development Holdings was due to acquire 51 per cent of Evergrande Property Services Group, in a deal worth around US$5.14-billion.

In a statement to the Hong Kong Exchange on Monday, Evergrande Property Services said there was a “possible general offer for the shares of the Company.” Trading in its shares were suspended pursuant to takeover rules, along with those of Hopson and China Evergrande, the parent company.

Evergrande Property Services operates in more than 290 cities in China and is contracted to manage more than 1,500 projects around the country, according to its website, “including medium and high-grade residential buildings, commercial properties, theme parks, industrial parks, health care complexes, themed towns and schools.”

“Looks like the property management unit is the easiest to dispose in the grand scheme of things, indicative of the company trying to generate near term cash,” said OCBC analyst Ezien Hoo. “I’m not sure this necessarily means that the company has given up on surviving, especially as selling an asset means they are still trying to raise cash to pay the bills.”

Investors can still find value in China, but be choosy, financial expert says

Is China still investable? Yes, but there needs to be a new approach

Hong Kong stocks sank on Monday, extending a four-month rout, as the Hang Seng Index fell to its lowest point since October last year. Japanese shares also ended lower, and European stocks struggled after the Monday opening.

News of Evergrande’s potential collapse last month rattled markets around the world, amid fears of a potential “Lehman moment” similar to how the collapse of the U.S. bank Lehman Brothers foreshadowed the 2008 financial crisis.

Evergrande’s massive over-leveraging is typical of China’s real estate market, which the authorities have been trying to rein in for years, concerned about the increasing price of property and potential economic damage a crash could cause.

Last year, the Chinese government introduced three “red lines” for property developers, requiring them to keep debt levels within reasonable bounds. Evergrande was in breach of all three, and soon found itself unable to raise more capital, even at one point reportedly approaching staff to loan the company money.

“The biggest problem is not a default by Evergrande but the environment that has led to its downfall. Authorities are regulating housing loans and lending to property firms. Markets are looking for a next Evergrande already,” said Kazutaka Kubo, senior economist at Okasan Securities.

“There is rising risk Evergrande’s woes will spread to the entire Chinese property sector.”

While the Chinese government is believed to be wary of bailing Evergrande out for fear this could send the wrong message, Paul Schulte, a former investment banker and founder of Schulte Research, said the company’s liabilities are “going to have to come out of someone’s pocket.”

“You have to put the debt somewhere, you can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube,” he said. “Either the banks are going to eat it, or the people who bought homes, or the government, or foreign [bond holders].”

While he said it was likely that there could be “a saviour coming in who’s a major property player,” Mr. Schulte predicted that nevertheless the government will have to “put some of this debt on the sovereign balance sheet.”

“We’re getting to a solution,” he added. “When people are in the mode of maximum panic is when you’re going to get a solution … China’s not interested in crisis. America leaps from one crisis to another, China doesn’t do crisis, they want things to be smooth.”

Evergrande, Hopson trade blame over collapse of unit deal

Market sentiment fragile despite government reassurances

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) has secured more time to pay a defaulted bond, financial provider REDD reported on Thursday, offering rare respite to the developer even as a debt crisis in the broader property sector deepened with more defaults.

News of the three month-plus extension came a day after Evergrande scrapped a deal to sell a 50.1% stake, worth $2.6 billion, in a property services unit that could have eased some immediate pressure on the firm. read more

Evergrande was once China's top-selling developer but is now reeling under more than $300 billion of debt, prompting government officials to seek to reassure markets that the firm's problems won't spin out of control.

A deepening liquidity crisis, however, continued to reverberate across China's property sector, with more default announcements, and many companies saw their bonds slip again on Thursday after they had rallied this week.

Kaisa Group's (1638.HK) most imminent offshore bond, which is due on Dec. 7 , fell 10 cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, 40% below face value, after a Hong Kong developer dumped $30 million worth of its bonds.

Kaisa was the first Chinese developer to default back in 2015 and the Evergrande crisis has put it back in the spotlight.

Citing unidentified bondholders, REDD said Evergrande had been granted a more than three-month extension to a $260-million bond, issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises and guaranteed by Evergrande, after agreeing to provide extra collateral.

The bond had been due to mature on Oct. 3.

A source familiar with the matter said Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan had agreed to pump personal wealth into a Chinese residential project tied to the bond to ensure it gets completed, paving the way for bondholders to get their dues.

The bondholders agreed to the proposal to avoid a messy collapse of the developer or a drawn-out legal battle, the source told Reuters. Evergrande did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The development comes just ahead of the expiry of a 30-day grace period for Evergrande to pay $83.5 million in coupon payments for an offshore bond, at which time, if it cannot pay, China's most indebted developer would be considered in default.

Evergrande, in an exchange filing on Wednesday, said the grace periods for the payment of the interest on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that were due in September and October had not expired. It did not elaborate.

It added it would continue to negotiate for the renewal or extension of its borrowings or other alternative arrangements with its creditors.

The scrapped $2.6 billion unit sale ""has made it even more unlikely for it (Evergrande) to pull a rabbit out of a hat at the last minute"", said a lawyer representing some creditors, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""Given where things are with the missed payments and the grace period running out soon, people are bracing for a hard default.""

CONTAGION RISK

Statements from Evergrande peers on Thursday exacerbated investor concerns of contagion in the $5 trillion Chinese property sector that accounts for a quarter of the country's economy by some metrics.

Oceanwide Holdings International Development, a unit of developer Oceanwide Holdings (000046.SZ), said on Thursday its notes due Oct. 31 , worth $134 million, had defaulted.

Modern Land China Co Ltd (1107.HK) said it had ceased seeking consent from investors to extend the maturity date of a dollar bond due on Oct. 25 , and that it planned to engage an adviser to solve its liquidity issues.

The company's Hong Kong-listed shares were suspended from trading on Thursday, while its bonds slumped. Its 11.95% March 2024 bond traded down nearly 20% at below 21 cents, according to data provider Duration Finance.

Modern Land's decision weighed on investors' mood, said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""The market is worried all single-B companies will choose not to pay,"" he said, referring to a credit rating level.

Investor concerns were not confined to offshore markets.

A September 2023 bond from developer Aoyuan Group Co was the biggest faller among corporate bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, according to exchange data, dropping 10% to 88.65 yuan.

Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Central China Real Estate (0832.HK) to ""B+"" from ""BB-"" with a negative outlook on Thursday, following a similar action by Moody's.

Fitch said China's attempts to keep tighter risk controls for the property sector without magnifying a growth slowdown illustrated the difficult trade-offs policymakers are facing.

If policy easing is too cautious, stress could spread to other parts of the economy and the financial system, while a substantial credit loosening could set back efforts to control financial risks, it added.

DEAL FAILURE

Trading in the Hong Kong-listed shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd (6666.HK) resumed on Thursday after a more than two-week suspension pending the announcement of the now-failed stake sale.

Evergrande closed down 12.5% and the services unit dropped 8%, while Evergrande's electric vehicle arm (0708.HK) eased 2%.

Shares in Hopson Development Holdings Ltd (0754.HK), which was in talks to buy the services unit stake, rose 7.6%.

Both sides traded blame for the deal failure, with Hopson saying Evergrande had asked it to make ""substantial changes"" to agreed terms. Evergrande said on Wednesday it had reason to believe Hopson had not met the ""prerequisite to make a general offer,"" without elaborating.

The deal is Evergrande's second to collapse amid a scramble to raise cash. Sources told Reuters last week the $1.7 billion sale of the developer's Hong Kong headquarters had failed. read more

Evergrande also said on Wednesday that, barring its sale of a stake worth $1.5 billion in Chinese lender Shengjing Bank Co (2066.HK), it had made no material progress in selling other assets.

Summary Modern Land cites liquidity issues for non-payment

State planner, forex regulator meet with overseas issuers

Hang Seng mainland property index falls more than 5%

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Modern Land (1107.HK) defaulted on a bond payment, the latest Chinese property developer to do so, adding to worries about the wider impact of the debt crisis at behemoth China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), and weighing on shares in the sector.

Modern Land (China) Co Ltd said in a filing on Tuesday that it had not repaid principal and interest on its 12.85% senior notes that matured on Monday due to ""unexpected liquidity issues"". The bond has outstanding principal of $250 million.

Separately, China's state planner said it and the foreign exchange regulator met with companies in ""key sectors"", which a source said included property firms, over their foreign debt holdings, asking them to ""optimise"" offshore debt structures and prepare to repay interest and principal on foreign bonds.

Modern Land's missed payment comes days after the company, a smaller developer, scrapped plans to seek investor consent to extend the maturity date of the bond by three months, saying doing so was not in the best interests of it and its stakeholders.

Ratings agency Fitch earlier this month cut Modern Land's rating to ""C"" from ""B"" over the attempt to change bond terms, saying it considered the move a distressed debt exchange. The debt default prompted ratings downgrades by Fitch and Moody's.

Developers are defaulting ""one by one"", said an investor with exposure to Chinese high-yield debt, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to media.

""The question is always, who's next?""

REGULATORS WEIGH IN

After weeks of near-silence as investor worries over Evergrande and other developers mounted, Chinese regulators including the centralbank have become increasingly vocal.

Late on Tuesday, China's National Development and Reform Commission said that it and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange had met with foreign debt issuers, telling them to use funds for approved purposes and ""jointly maintain their own reputations and the overall order of the market"".

This month, Fantasia Holdings Group (1777.HK) defaulted on a maturing dollar bond that heightened concerns in international debt markets, already roiled by worries over whether Evergrande would meet its obligations.

Evergrande, which narrowly averted a costly default last week, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities and has a major payment deadline on Friday.

The company said on Tuesday it would deliver 31 real estate projects under construction in China's Pearl River Delta region by the end of 2021. That number will rise to 40 by the end of June 2022, Evergrande said in comments to Reuters.

Evergrande had said on Sunday it had resumed work on more than 10 projects in six cities, including Shenzhen in southern China, after earlier halting them because it was unable to pay contractors. The developer has some 1,300 real estate projects across China in total.

Shares of property developers extended losses, hurt also by concern over China's plans to introduce a real estate tax.

China's CSI 300 Real Estate Index (.CSI000952) fell 2.8%, and the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI) dropped 4.3%. The broader Hang Seng index (.HSI) edged down 0.4% while China's CSI300 index (.CSI300) slipped 0.3%.

The prospect of contagion and more defaults have weighed on the sector in a major setback for investors.

Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd (0127.HK) said it would book a loss of HK$288.37 million ($2.24 billion) this fiscal year from its latest sale of bonds issued by Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd (1638.HK).

Modern Land's 11.8% February 2022 bond was down 1.6% at a discount of over 80% from its face value, yielding about 1,183%, according to data provider Duration Finance.

Evergrande shares ended the day down more than 4%. Shares in its electric vehicle (EV) unit (0708.HK) closed down 6.75% after earlier rising as much as 5.8%.

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Copper prices buckled under a stronger dollar on Tuesday ahead of key U.S. payroll data later this week and on lingering concerns over the fate of China Evergrande.

The U.S. dollar edged toward a one-year high against major peers, making greenback-priced metals more expensive to holders of other currencies, in anticipation of Friday’s non-farm payrolls data which is expected to give the Federal Reserve ammunition to start unwinding its easy monetary policy soon.

Worries over defaults at Chinese property developers and the potential impact on metals demand grew on Tuesday, amid fresh credit rating downgrades and uncertainty about the fate of China Evergrande.

There were bearish macro factors dragging metals prices down, including China Evergrande and the threat of stagflation due to power price increases, said Alastair Munro at brokerage Marex.

He added that declining inventories in exchange warehouses was a positive factor.

On-warrant copper stocks in LME-registered warehouses that are available to the market have more than halved since mid-August to 100,250 tonnes.MCUSTX-TOTAL

Meanwhile, in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange, copper stocks are at their lowest since 2009 at 43,525 tonnes CU-STX-SGH.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange shed 1.2% to $9,144 a tonne by 1633 GMT. The metal is seen as a sensitive gauge of global economic growth.

OUTLOOK: Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen said in a note that a break above $10,000 a tonne for copper would “likely be the signal that triggers a fresh move towards new all-time highs (of $10,747.50).”

“We believe that journey will resume sometime during the final quarter,” he said.

SPREADS: The premium of cash LME copper over the three-month contract MCU0-3 was at $3 a tonne, having eased from $19 a week ago.

OTHER METALS: LME aluminium fell 0.5% to $2,901 a tonne, zinc added 1% to $3,046, lead rose 0.8% to $2,164, tin was up 1.6% to $35,000 while nickel was shed 0.9% to $18,080.

BEIJING, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Heavily indebted property developer China Evergrande Group (3333.HK)owes the equivalent of $28 million for land in the northeastern city of Changchun it bought in June, municipal authorities said.

Evergrande bought the land through local developer Changchun Jitao Real Estate Development Co for 601 million yuan ($93 million) in an auction on June 17, part of a series of coordinated sales by 22 of China's biggest cities.

Evergrande, which did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, has been strapped for cash with over $300 billion in liabilities.

It failed to pay nearly $150 million worth of coupons on three bonds due on Monday, after missing two other bond payments in September. read more

The local developer paid a deposit of 120.3 million yuan but has yet to fully make the next round of payment equal to 50% of the transaction price, the Changchun Natural Resources and Planning Bureau said in a statement to Reuters when asked to confirm the sale.

Changchun Jitao Real Estate was required to pay the 50% within 30 days of the sale, but has only paid 20%, the bureau said in a faxed statement.

It still owes about 180 million yuan ($28 million), Reuters calculations show.

Changchun Jitao Real Estate has been urged to make the 50% payment in full, the bureau said in a statement dated Oct. 11.

Payment for the rest of the deal is not due yet, it said.

The plot of land, measuring 116,519 sq m (28.8 acres), is the only piece of land that Evergrande has bought this year in auctions conducted by 22 cities, which include Beijing and Shanghai, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices. read more

HONG KONG, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Two Hong Kong property agencies are suing heavily indebted China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) over unpaid commissions, according to a court filing and media reports, piling pressure on the developer as it scrambles to raise funds and avert a collapse.

Centaline filed a suit against Evergrande in September to recover HK$3.1 million ($398,196) in overdue commissions, a court filing showed, while the South China Morning Post newspaper reported Midland Holdings (1200.HK) is claiming unpaid commission of HK$43.45 million for two developments in Hong Kong.

An executive at Centaline China told Reuters they have also filed a suit against Evergrande in a Guangzhou court in southern China, seeking to claim hundreds of millions of yuan it says it is due.

Centaline confirmed to Reuters it filed a claim in Hong Kong last month, but declined to comment further. Midland declined to comment, saying the case was going through legal procedures. Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hong Kong's exposure to debt-laden developer China Evergrande is ""very minimal"" at 0.05%, or HK$14 billion ($1.79 billion) of banking assets and will not cause any systemic risks, the newspaper reported on Sunday, citing the city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan. read more

Evergrande has vowed to repay its suppliers and contractors in mainland China as soon as possible, in some cases offering apartments or other real estate assets, as construction at many of its sites have halted because of delayed payments.

With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its cash crunch could spread through China's financial system and reverberate globally, a worry that has eased with the Chinese central bank's vow last week to protect homebuyers' interests. read more

Growing worries about defaults at Chinese property developers triggered a rout in their shares and bonds on Tuesday with fresh credit rating downgrades and uncertainty about the fate of cash-strapped China Evergrande Group sapping investor sentiment. read more

Last month it missed coupon payments on two dollar bond tranches and is scrambling to sell assets to pay creditors, prioritising repayment to onshore lenders in the last few weeks.

It said on its website that management would make sure it reached mass-production next year.

Evergrande NEV warned in stock exchange filings last month that it was still looking for new investors and to make asset sales, and without either it may struggle to pay employee salaries and cover other expenses. It also scrapped plans to list shares in mainland China.

Oct 7 (Reuters) - Holders of a dollar bond guaranteed by China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) and one of its units are yet to receive repayment on maturity, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.

Jumbo Fortune Enterprises, a joint venture whose owners include Evergrande's main onshore unit, issued the bond at an initial amount of $260 million, according to the report.

Some bond holders did not receive the payment that matured on Oct. 3 as of Thursday in Hong Kong, the news agency said.

A nonpayment of the bond's principal may constitute a default as the note has no grace period, although five business days would be allowed if the failure to pay were due to administrative or technical error, the Bloomberg report said.

Evergrande did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

NewsApi.org,"BEIJING, Oct 24 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) said on Sunday it had resumed work on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen - a statement that comes after it appeared to avert default with a last-minute bond coupon payment last week.

Evergrande, deep in crisis with more than $300 billion in liabilities, has not disclosed how many of its 1,300 real estate projects across China it has had to halt work on.

The company said on Aug. 31 that some projects were suspended because of delays in payment to suppliers and contractors and it was negotiating to resume building.

On Sunday, it said in a post on its Wechat account that some of the projects it had resumed work on had entered the interior decoration stage while other buildings had recently finished construction.

Evergrande added that its efforts to guarantee construction would shore up market confidence and included several photos of construction workers on different projects, stamped with the time and date.

China's second-largest property developer last month also promised potential buyers it will complete building of their homes and said that work on one of the world's biggest soccer stadiums in the southern city of Guangzhou was proceeding as planned.

Last week's move to pay $83.5 million in interest on a U.S. dollar bond has bought Evergrande another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

Highlighting the stresses on its core business, Evergrande also announced on Friday plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.

Its debt crisis is also being widely watched by global financial markets concerned about broader contagion.

HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) has supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default.

Shares of Evergrande, which is saddled with more than $300 billion in liabilities, rose as much as 8% early on Friday, and were still up more than 4% at noon.

Here is what people are saying about the world's most indebted developer, whose fate could ripple through global markets.

PAUL LUKASZEWSKI, HEAD OF CORPORATE DEBT, ASIA PACIFIC, ABRDN, SINGAPORE

""Evergrande making its interest payment is a positive surprise. Importantly other developers also confirmed making interest payments – for a market which has fully capitulated, the fact the world did not end overnight could itself be a positive catalyst.

""The main takeaway for Evergrande's creditors is that they are all being treated the same; everyone is being kept current as the company has avoided a formal default for the time being.

""Multiple financing channels are effectively closed to developers in response to the policies implemented by the government. For those channels to reopen, investors have to believe these companies can remain going concerns. This means they need to have sufficient access to their own cash flows and to refinancing options to address their debt as it becomes due.""

DICKIE WONG, KINGSTON SECURITIES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HONG KONG

""Even though Evergrande has paid the coupon for the U.S. denominate bond, well never say never, maybe on the next one they will default. There is still a very high default risk for the U.S. bonds, in the next couple of months.

""Chinese policy will not allow property developers to dump their properties at low prices and not allow an overheating or bubble in the market as well. In the longer term, I don't see much upside for the sector and investors are better off avoiding the developers that have already hit the three red lines.""

JEFFREY HALLEY, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ASIA PACIFIC, OANDA, SINGAPORE

""China, in the bigger picture, although they don't want to be seen to bail out Evergrande for a whole bunch of reasons ... like HNA they'll be looking to do an orderly wind down. We've got the central committee meeting in early November, and the last thing they'd want is a disorderly collapse of Evergrande ahead of that meeting, especially when President Xi is talking about shared prosperity, Evergrande does employ 1.5 million people directly or indirectly, so that wouldn't be a good look on that front if it was allowed to fall into a disorderly collapse.""

""I think this will be a short-term positive, I'm just not sure how long that momentum will last, whether it carries into next week or not. There are so many different possibilities for the way that this story could evolve it's really hard to predict what's going to happen.

""And I think because of that it will still be a headwind for China markets because there's just so many variables, so many ways this story could wash out... I think this will be a short-term positive but I don't think this will change the overarching fears about what the true state of the sector or the China economy is at the moment.""

CHUANYI ZHOU, CREDIT ANALYST AT LUCROR ANALYTICS, SINGAPORE

""It is a boost to investor confidence for both Evergrande and the other Chinese property USD bonds, especially in terms of willingness to pay. That said, Evergrande has more payments coming up. We wait to see if the company is able to fulfil the obligations.""

KENNY NG, EVERBRIGHT SUN HUNG KAI ANALYST, HONG KONG

""I think investors should not be overly optimistic about this. After all, Evergrande will still have many debts to be repaid in the short term in the future, and its fundamentals such as sales situation have not seen any obvious signs of improvement for the time being. At the same time, the current price of Evergrande’s bonds still reflects the lack of confidence in the market for its future.

""Therefore, the rebound of Evergrande's share price may be just a short-term performance, and investors should adopt a cautious attitude.""

JACKSON CHAN, ASSISTANT MANAGER OF FIXED INCOME RESEARCH AT BONDSUPERMART, HONG KONG

“It is not really surprising news for us, as we can expect that from the previous moves from Evergrande, including the three-month maturity extension of its Jumbo Fortune bond and a coupon repayment on its onshore bond which was settled in cash. It is obvious that they want to avoid near-term bonds default that could allow creditors to claim against and liquidate its offshore and onshore assets.

""The company may pay the remaining coupons on the last day of each bond's grace period. But is it good news for bondholders? At this point it is unclear, because this move further buys time for the company to sell their assets, which can eat into the recovery value of the bonds if they default eventually. Therefore, at this moment, we do not see the market reacted very positively towards this news.”

HONG HAO, BOCOM HEAD OF RESEARCH, HONG KONG

""It's not a surprise that Evergrande has made the payment in the grace period, but it is one of many obstacles that it is facing. There are many, many liabilities that are due. The deal with Hopson to sell the property services company has fallen through, so they still have to come up with money somehow.

""If you look at the 'three red lines' policy released last year, there are a number of developers that fall into the red zone, and it is these developers which are seeing problems right now. I think we will see more default events coming through.""

WEI LIANG CHANG, MACRO STRATEGIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE

""In the short term, we believe the interest repayment should provide a fillip to Chinese risk assets, including the yuan and Chinese equities. Evergrande default risks, though not dissipated, have likely been deferred for some time.""

CASTOR PANG, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT CORE PACIFIC, HONG KONG

""The market is in ‘wait and see’ because Evergrande still has a large pile of debt with the next batch of default dates coming up soon. Its liquidity is so bad it’s questionable whether it can repay other debts.

""Its sale of the services unit failed and its September and October sales were getting worse and worse. It has very little cash. This repayment also doesn’t lift the sentiment of the sector, because those companies in cash crunch will still be struggling. The situation doesn’t change unless PBOC loosen more credits.""

MOH SIONG SIM, CURRENCY ANALYST, BANK OF SINGAPORE

""There is still a lot of scepticism. Bond prices have not picked up a lot. It's a situation where they'll try to keep it going until they can't.

""What's important is the property market, because they have a lot of projects under construction and the worst scenario would be if they go down and projects are left unfinished and that creates spillover for the economy. They have bought themselves some time.""

GARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG

""That Evergrande is able to fulfil its obligation after the grace period on the offshore bond is positive at least in the short term as it shows a certain commitment from the firm and provides a relief for offshore bond investors.

""However, they still have a bunch of deadlines coming up before the end of March. To fulfil all the obligations and the bond coupon payments they still need liquidity either from themselves or from offloading assets. Even though Evergrande managed to repay the coupon this time, it’s still quite challenging for them to meet all their future obligations.""

TRAVIS LUNDY, QUIDDITY ADVISORS ANALYST, HONG KONG

""I expect it means they also plan to pay the offshore bond coupons due by the 29th. There's no point in paying this one if you fully plan on not paying the next one six days later, but given the company's self-reported cashflow difficulties, it is not clear how long they can keep that up.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term. And I expect Hopson's clarified response yesterday means lawsuits if Evergrande tries to sell Evergrande Property Services to someone else.""

Oct 7 (Reuters) - Holders of a dollar bond guaranteed by China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) and one of its units are yet to receive repayment on maturity, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.

Jumbo Fortune Enterprises, a joint venture whose owners include Evergrande's main onshore unit, issued the bond at an initial amount of $260 million, according to the report.

Some bond holders did not receive the payment that matured on Oct. 3 as of Thursday in Hong Kong, the news agency said.

A nonpayment of the bond's principal may constitute a default as the note has no grace period, although five business days would be allowed if the failure to pay were due to administrative or technical error, the Bloomberg report said.

Evergrande did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Evergrande, teetering on the brink of collapse with more than $300 billion in debt, was in talks to sell the stake in Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK) to smaller rival Hopson Development Holdings (0754.HK) for around HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion), sources have previously told Reuters.

However, the deal has been put on hold as it has yet to win blessings from the Guangdong provincial government, which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring, one of the people said on Tuesday.

It's not immediately clear why the provincial government has not approved the transaction. Some offshore creditors of Evergrande also opposed the deal, the person added.

When contacted, a Hopson representative asked Reuters to await an announcement. Evergrande and the Guangdong provincial government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

Hopson to buy 51% stake in property services unit - report

Smaller rival Fantasia misses bond payment, Fitch slashes rating

Broader market nervousness returns, offshore yuan slips

HONG KONG, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Debt-saddled China Evergrande is set to raise more than $5 billion by selling a majority stake in its property management arm, Chinese media said on Monday, a deal which would be the struggling giant's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead.

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Evergrande (3333.HK) on Monday said it requested a halt in the trading of its shares in Hong Kong pending an announcement about a major transaction. Evergrande Property Services Group (6666.HK), a spin-off listed last year, also requested a halt and said it referred to ""a possible general offer for shares of the company.""

China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development (0754.HK) was the buyer of a 51% stake in the property business for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing unspecified other media reports. Hopson also said it had suspended its shares, pending an announcement related to a major acquisition of a Hong Kong-listed firm and a possible mandatory offer.

Neither Hopson nor Evergrande responded to requests for comment on the Global Times report.

Analysts said the possible deal signals the company is still working to meet its obligations. But it also underscored concerns about the rest of China's property sector and the broader economy if there is a fire-sale of Evergrande's assets.

NERVOUSNESS

Evergrande's property services business, which says it managed a total contracted floor area of 810 million square metres at the end of June, was also profitable in the first half of 2021, based on its financial statements.

With liabilities equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, Evergrande has sparked concerns its troubles could spread through the global financial system.

Nervousness has eased after China's central bank vowed to protect homebuyers' interests, but ramifications for China's economy kept investors on edge - particularly as signs of distress have begun spreading to Evergrande's peers.

Monday's share trading suspension knocked the offshore yuan , which fell about 0.3% against the dollar, and weighed on the Hang Seng benchmark index (.HSI).

Still, the possible deal activity lifted shares in Evergrande's electric vehicle unit (0708.HK) by 29% but cast a pall over regional stocks and global markets (.MIAPJ0000PUS).

""It is definitely a positive move towards solving Evergrande’s liquidity crisis and we expect more to come,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist Asia Pacific at Natixis.

""However, having said that, offloading some assets may not be totally sufficient, the key for Evergrande is to get project construction going and to sell inventory.""

Shares in Evergrande have plunged 80% so far this year, while its bonds have held steady at distressed levels.

The group said last month it had negotiated a settlement with some domestic bondholders and made a repayment on some wealth management products, largely held by Chinese retail investors.

Holders of the company's $20 billion in offshore debt appear further back in the creditor queue and bondholders have said interest payments due in the past few weeks have failed to arrive.

Evergrande faces deadlines on dollar bond coupon payments totalling $162.38 million in October.

NewsApi.org,"BEIJING, Oct 24 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) said on Sunday it had resumed work on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen - a statement that comes after it appeared to avert default with a last-minute bond coupon payment last week.

Evergrande, deep in crisis with more than $300 billion in liabilities, has not disclosed how many of its 1,300 real estate projects across China it has had to halt work on.

The company said on Aug. 31 that some projects were suspended because of delays in payment to suppliers and contractors and it was negotiating to resume building.

On Sunday, it said in a post on its Wechat account that some of the projects it had resumed work on had entered the interior decoration stage while other buildings had recently finished construction.

Evergrande added that its efforts to guarantee construction would shore up market confidence and included several photos of construction workers on different projects, stamped with the time and date.

China's second-largest property developer last month also promised potential buyers it will complete building of their homes and said that work on one of the world's biggest soccer stadiums in the southern city of Guangzhou was proceeding as planned.

Last week's move to pay $83.5 million in interest on a U.S. dollar bond has bought Evergrande another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

Highlighting the stresses on its core business, Evergrande also announced on Friday plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.

Its debt crisis is also being widely watched by global financial markets concerned about broader contagion.

LONDON/SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Investors who have watched China's property sector crisis play out in recent months have just been denied their Evergrande grand finale as the world's most indebted developer dodged a $19 billion default, but they might not have too long to wait.

China Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) woes have been snowballing for months. Dwindling resources set against 2 trillion yuan ($305 billion) of liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value this year, and there is still a stream of bills to be paid.

Economists are worried an implosion of the super-sized builder may be impossible to control, toppling other developers and turning an already-defining crisis for the world's second largest economy into a full-blown disaster.

For now, its decision to transfer the $83.5 million needed to pay a month overdue bond coupon has staved off disaster.

""There is a positive out of this, they have not defaulted,"" said Himanshu Porwal, corporate credit analyst at Seaport Global in London.

""But they are not out of the woods. There is a huge ticking time bomb of $37 billion of short-term debt.""

Evergrande still needs to make overdue coupon payments of $195 million, with the next major deadlines to avoid default on Oct. 29 and Nov. 10. It then has a further $340 million of international market bond payments due this year and another $6.1 billion next year, plus tens of billions for local bonds and bank loans.

A number of smaller developers have already been forced to the wall, and with roughly a third of the sector's $232 billion of cross-border bonds needing to be refinanced by the end of next year according to Fitch, borrowing markets need to be prised back open.

That requires confidence, which has been almost completely drained by the Evergrande saga. If the company is to survive it will need to quickly sell its assets, which will be tricky.

Just this week a $2.6 billion stake sale fell through and plans sell its Hong Kong headquarters have also collapsed.

Still, Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, thinks Evergrande's assets are still worth more than its battered bond prices of 20-27 cents on the dollar reflect. ,

""The surprise factor here is actually skewed in the opposite direction, upside surprise.""

LEHMAN MOMENT

Omotunde Lawal, head of emerging-markets corporate debt at asset manager Barings, said the darkest moment was when amid the Evergrande turmoil, another sizable property firm, Fantasia (1777.HK), defaulted out of the blue.

Although the worst of the rout has been mainly confined to Asia's high-yield markets, the risk premiums, or spread, investors were demanding to hold Asian property firms' bonds rocketed to an almost unprecedented 1200 basis points.

""It felt like we were back at a Lehman sort of moment,"" Lawal said, referring to the collapse of the investment bank in 2008. ""So it gives you a sense for just how much capitulation and how much destruction there was in the real estate sector.""

GAME-CHANGER

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, Evergrande epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, now brought to an end by hundreds of new rules designed by Beijing to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

Analysts say the bigger picture now is what happens to Evergrande's assets and the more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in over 280 cities, and the impact on the wider property sector that accounts for a quarter of China's economy should it default or restructure.

A leaked 2020 document, written off as a fabrication by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed liabilities extending to more than 128 banks and more than 121 non-banking institutions.

Evergrande crisis causes major property sector sell off

Evergrande's woes have also reignited the debate about whether some Chinese firms are really too big to fail, especially after Beijing's clampdowns on tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent wiped nearly a trillion dollars off its markets earlier this year.

Amundi's Co-Head of EM Corporate & EM High Yield, Colm d’Rosario said both cases show the government's focus is now on ""common prosperity"" while its acceptance of uninhibited corporate debt accumulation has changed.

Debt analysts hope any damage from Evergrande might not be too widespread. Although China accounts for just over a quarter of JPMorgan's $1.4 trillion CEMBI index, a benchmark for emerging market corporate debt buyers, just $6.75 billion of Evergrande's $19 billion of international bond debt is included.

""If you had an assumption of too big to fail in a high-yield sector, You didn't think about it properly,"" said veteran emerging market crisis watcher Jeff Grills, who heads EM fixed income at U.S. fund Aegon Asset Management.

""China's government has wanted to see excess risk controlled and they also do not want to see a property bubble.""

He said that while some money managers may recalibrate their risk metrics, the current crisis shouldn't put people off investing in China altogether.

Broader market nervousness returns, offshore yuan slips

HONG KONG, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Debt-saddled China Evergrande is set to raise more than $5 billion by selling a majority stake in its property management arm, Chinese media said on Monday, a deal which would be the struggling giant's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead.

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Evergrande (3333.HK) on Monday said it requested a halt in the trading of its shares in Hong Kong pending an announcement about a major transaction. Evergrande Property Services Group (6666.HK), a spin-off listed last year, also requested a halt and said it referred to ""a possible general offer for shares of the company.""

China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development (0754.HK) was the buyer of a 51% stake in the property business for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing unspecified other media reports. Hopson also said it had suspended its shares, pending an announcement related to a major acquisition of a Hong Kong-listed firm and a possible mandatory offer.

Neither Hopson nor Evergrande responded to requests for comment on the Global Times report.

Analysts said the possible deal signals the company is still working to meet its obligations. But it also underscored concerns about the rest of China's property sector and the broader economy if there is a fire-sale of Evergrande's assets.

""Selling an asset means they are still trying to raise cash to pay the bills,"" said OCBC analyst Ezien Hoo. ""Looks like the property management unit is the easiest to dispose in the grand scheme of things.""

Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's largest defaults as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and whose troubles have already sent shockwaves across global markets, missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, offshore investors have been left wondering if they will face large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods for last month's coupons. [nL8N2QP1H5]

A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them. read more

Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis.

""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.

""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he said

Evergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Neil McDonald, a restructuring partner in the Hong Kong office of Kirkland & Ellis, said the bondholders would like more transparency, and hoped Evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under stock listing rules.

The offshore bondholders are also demanding more information about Evergrande's plan to divest some businesses and how the proceeds would be used, the advisers said, adding that the creditors group they represent was growing.

The two advisers said that, including the parties that have expressed an interest to be part of the group, they represent bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds.

Evergrande said last month it would sell a $1.5-billion stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd (2066.HK). The bank, one of Evergrande's main lenders, demanded cash from the sale go towards settling the developer's debts with Shengjing.

Trading in Evergrande shares has been halted since Monday pending a major deal announcement. Trading in its Evergrande Property Services Group (6666.HK) unit was also halted.

China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development (0754.HK) was to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing other media reports.

""Whilst we don't want to overstate this, we are obviously at this point in time preparing contingency plans to ensure that there are no dissipation of assets,"" McDonald said.

""And if there is such activity, we will be prepared to take steps to protect the rights and interests of U.S. creditors, and we really hope that that's not necessary,"" he added.

The advisers for offshore Evergrande bondholders had reached the developer on Sept. 16, but had not received any assurance from the developer, demanding more transparency.

SECTOR SLUMP

In another development, Evergrande dollar-bond trustee Citi (C.N) has hired law firm Mayer Brown as counsel, a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters earlier on Friday.

Citi and Mayer Brown declined to comment.

The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.

With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday.

""The potential lack of transparency and clarity are leaving investors more skittish and it will be very difficult for people to want to refinance any debt coming due in that particular sector,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.

An index tracking China's property sector (.CSI000952) dropped 1.53%, against a 1.31% blue-chip share rise (.CSI300).

The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading of two bonds issued by smaller developer Fantasia Group China Co, with one dropping more than 50%, after controlling shareholder Fantasia Holdings Group (1777.HK) missed the deadline on a $206 million international market debt payment on Monday.

Fantasia Holding said in a stock exchange filing on Friday that it had appointed Houlihan Lokey and Sidley Austin as its advisers to assess its capital structure, evaluate liquidity and explore solutions to ease its current liquidity issue.

Most of Evergrande and Fantasia's bonds have already lost around 80% of their value.

Meanwhile, bonds issued by Greenland Holdings (0337.HK), which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers including in Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, and Kaisa Group both took another beating on Friday. L8N2R433Z.

""Market participants are questioning if this may be a precursor for voluntary defaults by other developers with healthy short-term liquidity positions, but large unsustainable longer-term debt,"" Chang Wei Liang, Credit & FX Strategist at DBS Bank, said in a note.

Summary Central bank makes rare comments on Evergrande debt situation

PBOC: financial firms don't have concentrated Evergrande risk

Evergrande CEO holds restructuring talks in Hong Kong with banks

Xinyuan Real Estate agrees to exchange offer with bondholders

Evergrande has 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities

SHANGHAI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The spillover effect of China Evergrande Group's debt problems on the banking system is controllable, a central bank official said on Friday, in rare official comments on a liquidity crisis at China's No. 2 developer that has roiled global markets.

Chinese authorities are urging Evergrande to step up asset disposals and the resumption of projects, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), told a briefing, adding that individual financial institutions did not have highly concentrated exposure to Evergrande. read more

""In recent years, this company did not operate and manage itself well. It failed to conduct prudent operations according to changing market conditions, and it blindly diversified and expanded its business,"" Zou told the briefing in Beijing.

Chinese officials and state media have been largely silent on the crisis at Evergrande, which has missed a series of bond interest payments and has $300 billion in debt, making it the world's most indebted developer.

Zou also said property firms that have issued bonds overseas should actively fulfil their debt repayment obligations.

Evergrande has left its offshore investors in the dark about repayment plans after already missing three rounds of interest payments on its dollar bonds.

Zou's comments came as sources told Reuters that Evergrande (3333.HK) CEO Xia Haijun was holding talks in Hong Kong with investment banks and creditors over a possible restructuring and asset sales. read more

Xia had been in Hong Kong for more than two months, several sources told Reuters. Xia needed to communicate with foreign banks on loan extensions and repayments, one of the sources said.

Joining a list of property developers reeling from the debt crisis, China Properties Group Ltd (1838.HK) said on Friday it had defaulted on notes worth $226 million.

Another Chinese developer, Xinyuan Real Estate Co's (XIN.N), avoided a default on a maturing dollar bond on Friday, saying in a Singapore Exchange filing that bondholders had agreed to an offer to accept new bonds and cash in exchange for maturing notes. read more

Xinyuan said that holders of more than 90% of the company's $229 million notes due Oct. 15 had agreed to the exchange, which would see it deliver new bonds worth $205.4 million and $19.1 million cash.

Xinyuan's 14.5% September 2023 bond crashed nearly 30% on Friday to trade at 58.35 cents, according to data provider Duration Finance.

The agreement follows warnings from other developers that they could default on their bonds, while still others have taken steps to delay payments in the wake of Evergrande's troubles.

Evergrande, with 1,300 real estate projects in more than 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week.

However, in a separate statement filed to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Evergrande said it would pay interest coming due on Oct. 19 on a yuan-denominated bond it issued in 2020.

PBOC URGES SPEEDY ASSET SALES

At the Friday briefing, Zou said Evergrande should step up asset disposals and the resumption of project building, for which authorities will provide financing support.

Some lenders have had “misunderstandings"" about the central bank’s debt control policies, causing financial strains for some developers, as some new projects were unable to get loans even after repaying existing loans, Zou said.

""This short-term extreme reaction is a normal market phenomenon,” he said.

Chinese developers face more than $500 million in coupon payments on their high-yield bonds before the end of this month. Refinitiv data show coupon payments by Kaisa Group Holdings (1638.HK) and Fantasia Holdings (1777.HK) are due this weekend. read more

""In some cities, the property prices surged too fast, causing the approval and issuance of personal mortgages to be restrained,"" Zou said, referring to the first nine months of this year.

""Once housing prices stabilise, the supply and demand of mortgages in those cities will be normalized too,"" he said.

FRESH SETBACKS

Still, Evergrande suffered fresh setbacks on Friday with sources telling Reuters that Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy the company's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation. read more

Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some assets to repay creditors knocking on its doors and the collapse of the talks shows the difficulties it is facing.

Adding to its woes, Hong Kong's audit regulator said on Friday it was investigating Evergrande's 2020 accounts and their audit by PwC because it had concerns about the adequacy of reporting on whether it could continue operating as a going concern. read more

Evergrande bonds fell following the Reuters report. The company's 8.75% June 2025 bonds slumped more than 6% to trade at a discount of more than 80% from its face value, according to data provider Duration Finance.

BOND SLUMP DEEPENS

Apart from Xinyuan, Duration Finance data showed other developers' bonds deepening their rout. Sinic Holdings Group's 10.5% June 2022 bond dived more than 20% to just 12.25 cents, and Ronshine China Holdings' February 2022 bond fell more than 6% to 68.35 cents.

Moody's downgraded Risesun Real Estate Development Co Ltd (002146.SZ) to B1/B2, with a negative outlook.

Spreads on Chinese high-yield corporate dollar bonds (.MERACYC) touched a fresh record late Thursday evening U.S. time, having nearly tripled since late May, while investment-grade spreads remained near their widest in more than two months (.MERACCG).

Worries of contagion have also hit property developers' shares this week. On Friday, an index tracking A-shares in the sector (.CSI000952) gave up small gains to end down 0.1%, lagging a 0.38% gain in the blue-chip index (.CSI300) and taking losses since Tuesday to 4.5%.

China has been ramping up property market curbs since late 2020, introducing new measures to closely monitor and control developers' debt levels.

But with economic growth cooling and new construction starts slowing, speculation has been rife over whether it will start relaxing those restrictions, as was the case during previous downturns.

SHANGHAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Shares and bonds of Chinese real estate companies slid on Thursday, reflecting uncertainty about how a debt crisis will play out at China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) and the wider property sector as another developer was hit by a rating downgrade.

Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities and 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week.

The world's most indebted developer, which has been trying to sell assets to raise funds, appeared to have made small progress towards that goal when Qumei Home Furnishings Group (603818.SS) announced in a filing on Thursday that it will buy out Evergrande group's 40% stake in their furnishings joint venture for 72 million yuan ($11.18 million).

But in a sign of its continued cash flow problems, municipal officials in Changchun said Evergrande has yet to make $28 million payment for land it acquired in the northeastern city earlier this year. read more

Other Chinese developers have also warned they could default on bond payments, and rising risks on Wednesday led credit rating agency S&P Global to downgrade two of the sector's bigger companies, Greenland Holdings (600606.SS) - which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers - and E-house (2048.HK). S&P also said it could cut their ratings further. read more

On Thursday, Fitch Ratings issued the latest downgrade, cutting Modern Land (China) Co (1107.HK) to a single-C rating after the developer said it was seeking consent from investors to extend a bond's maturity date by three months.

Investors have been hoping China would ease monetary policy to stabilise its wobbly recovery, but data on Thursday showed China's annual factory gate prices rising at the fastest pace on record in September due to soaring raw material costs. read more

Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said persistent inflationary pressure would limit the scope of any monetary policy easing.

""But the most important policy in the property sector is not monetary policy, but the regulation related to leverage and bank loan supply to developers (and) home buyers,"" he said.

""Therefore I think the government still has the option to loosen those policies to help the property sector,"" Zhang said.

""The big question is whether they are willing to do so. So far their policy stance seems quite firm.""

On Thursday, a sub-index tracking shares of Chinese property developers (.CSI000952) ended the day down 3.88%, while the broad CSI300 blue-chip index (.CSI300) slipped 0.54%. Property shares have fallen nearly 20% this year, compared with a 5.7% fall for the CSI300.

JPMorgan analysts said China property shares would remain volatile in the near term.

""News on marginal easing will likely cause a short-term rebound, which, however, may not be very sustainable due to the likely ongoing concerns on the offshore bond market,"" they said.

""A more sustainable rally may happen in January 2022 when banks have more front-loaded quota to extend credit to developers/mortgages.""

China property shares vs blue-chips

LIGHTNING RODS

In China's onshore bond market there was still a lot of price volatility, with bonds of developer Shanghai Shimao (600823.SS) listed among both the biggest gainers and biggest losers on the day by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

""Property bonds are lightning rods,"" said a director at a local brokerage. Apart from the risk of debt contagion from Evergrande, higher mortgage rates - part of official efforts to rein in surging housing prices - are hitting the industry, he said. ""Fundamentally, the high turnover of real estate companies is gone.""

In international debt markets, data provider Duration Finance showed Greenland Group Holdings' 6.75% June 2022 bond was trading down more than 3 points at 60.175 cents, and Xinyuan Real Estate's 14.5% September 2023 bond slumped nearly 8 points to 63.9 cents.

Markets in Hong Kong were closed on Thursday for a public holiday.

Worries about the potential for spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader global economy kept the spread - or risk premium - on investment-grade Chinese companies (.MERACCG), which tend to have the most solid finances, near its widest in more than two months late on Wednesday.

The spread on the equivalent high-yield or junk-rated index (.MERACYC) that tracks companies such as Evergrande pulled back on Wednesday, but remained close to all-time highs.

Oil surges, adding pressure to inflation outlook

NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar eased and a gauge of global equity markets fell on Monday as investors worried about the potential for renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, stalled talks in Congress and rising inflation as oil prices surged to multi-year highs.

The dollar weakened from last week's one-year highs as investors looked ahead to the release on Friday of September employment data, which could signal when the Federal Reserve begins to taper asset purchases.

Gold prices rose to a more than one-week high on the weaker U.S. currency and risk off sentiment in equity markets lifted demand for the safe-haven metal.

SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The safe-haven dollar found support just below last week's peaks on Monday as renewed concerns about China's property sector and looming U.S. labour data put investors in a cautious mood.

The greenback scaled a 14-month high on the euro and a 19-month top on the yen last week as markets reckoned U.S. interest rates could rise ahead of global peers.

The euro dipped back below $1.16 and at $1.1598 is not far from last week's trough at $1.1563. The yen was little changed at 111.065 per dollar. The offshore yuan fell about 0.3%.

Shares in embattled developer China Evergrande (3333.HK) were halted in Hong Kong, rekindling market nerves about the possibility of contagion. read more

Evergrande said it requested a trading halt pending an announcement about a major transaction, while unit Evergrande Property Services Group said the announcement constitutes ""a possible general offer for shares of the company."" read more

Investors are concerned that a collapse at Evergrande could hurt an already fragile Chinese economy and drag on global growth. The U.S. dollar index edged up 0.08% to 94.029.

""(There's) a bit of nervousness,"" said Moh Siong Sim, currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore, even if most traders still think Evergrande's systemic risk can be contained.

""It's part of the wall of worry,"" he said, which the market could eventually ""climb"" if the COVID backdrop improves, growth stabilises and inflation concerns subside, but which for now is keeping investor sentiment fairly dour.

Besides Evergrande, a Friday CNBC report which said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will announce on Monday that China is not complying with U.S.-China trade rules also provided support to the dollar, especially against the yuan.

Chinese markets were closed for a holiday.

In the week ahead, the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday and is expected to keep policy steady. Across the Tasman, a 25 basis point hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday is priced in.

The Australian dollar was about flat at $0.72685 and the New Zealand dollar was little changed at $0.6941.

On Friday, U.S. labour data is expected to show continued improvement in the job market, with a forecast for 460,000 jobs to have been added in September - enough to keep the Federal Reserve on course to begin tapering before year's end.

""The question is whether there is a number that alters the Fed's view on tapering its bond purchases in November, and what a really weak or hot number means amid the backdrop of rising stagflation fears,"" said Pepperstone's head of research, Chris Weston.

""If U.S. Treasuries find further buyers this week into Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls, the dollar may go on sale this week.""

Elsewhere economists polled by Reuters expect the cash rate on hold in Australia until at least 2024, as the RBA has been insisting it will be.

Swaps markets show a 97% probability of a rate hike in New Zealand on Wednesday and a 96% chance of another one in November.

Sterling, meanwhile, despite Friday gains, is still nursing losses from a sharp drawdown last week when traders shrugged off hawkish central bank rhetoric to focus on a sour outlook and the risk of both higher rates and inflation.

The pound was about flat from last week at $1.3540.

""Investors are judging the UK by its whole suite of fundamentals factors and movements in sterling suggest that many are not liking what they are seeing,"" said Rabobank strategist Jane Foley, as the currency erases early 2021 gains.

""The UK no longer has an advantage on the vaccine front...and, while PM (Boris) Johnson likes to view Brexit as 'done', many businesses and commentators are only just starting to evaluate its impact.""

Oct 21 (Reuters) - European stocks steadied at six-week highs on Thursday, as buying of defensives and growth stocks helped offset losses in miners and disappointing earnings forecasts, including from software major SAP.

European miners (.SXPP), which have a large exposure to China (.SXPP), shed 3.0% as iron ore and base metal price plunged. UK-listed shares of Anglo American (AAL.L) fell 2.7% even though it reported a 2% rise in overall production in the third quarter. read more

Property firms top losers in Shanghai exchange traded bonds

Some property shares gain on hopes of policy support

HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group (3333.HK), missed its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and others warned of defaults.

A wave of developers face payment deadlines before the end of the year and with Evergrande's fate looking increasingly bleak, fears are mounting of a wider crisis.

Weary Evergrande bondholders still haven't received almost $150 million worth of coupon payments that had been due on Monday, although there was little surprise after the firm had skipped two other payments in recent weeks.

Evergrande didn't reply to a Reuters request for comment. It has maintained radio silence for weeks and markets are now counting down to a Oct. 18-19 deadline when it will be formally declared in default if it still hasn't stumped up.

""It is pretty serious now and it looks like it is going to be long and drawn out process,"" said London-based Trium Capital fund manager Peter Kisler about Evergrande and the wider crisis.

""I don't see the recovery being particularly high,"" he said referring to what Evergrande bondholders would get if Evergrande gets broken up. ""I think 20 cents (for every dollar of the bonds' original face value) is more or less fair.""

The IMF said on Tuesday that China has the ability to address the issues linked to Evergrande's indebtedness, with the fiscal capacity and the legal and institutional tools. read more

The IMF's report, however, said that while contagion so far has been limited to other financially weak property developers and lower-rated firms, if the situation were to ""escalate, there is a risk that broader financial stress may emerge.""

Problems have already spread well beyond just Evergrande.

Mid-sized rival Fantasia (1777.HK) also missed a payment and Modern Land (1107.HK) and Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) are trying to delay deadlines that would still most likely be classed as a default by the main rating agencies.

Star stock picker Cathie Wood of ARK Invest seperately cautioned of an economic slowdown in China that could ripple through the global economy and weigh on commodity prices and growth. read more

Dec. 17 - Fantasia (1777.HK) $249 million

The $5 trillion Chinese property sector, accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics and is often a major factor in Beijing policymaking.

""We see more defaults ahead if the liquidity problem does not improve markedly,"" said brokerage CGS-CIMB in a note, adding developers with weaker credit ratings would find it very difficult to refinance debt at the moment.

Shanghai Stock Exchange data showed the top five losers among exchange-traded bonds in morning deals were all issued by property firms.

Modern Land's dollar bond due for repayment in 2023 plunged 25% to 32.250 cents on the dollar, while Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, and Greenland Holdings, which wants to build western Europe's tallest residential building, both saw more savage selling. ,

It wasn't all one-way traffic. Sinic's bond due in 2022 rose 12% to 19.35 cents. That still left its yield - a proxy of its likely borrowing cost if it were to try and tap financial markets - at over 1,380%. Some of Central China Real Estate's bonds due next month also gained.

Modern Land, whose shares dropped over 3% to new low on Tuesday, asked bondholders on Monday to delay for three months a repayment due later this month, while Sinic said it would likely default next week.

BROADER FALLOUT?

Market indicators also show how contagion is slowly spreading to other high yield markets in the developing world.

Trium's Kisler highlighted how most emerging market companies whose yields were already around the 10% mark have been hit and even riskier sovereign markets like Ecuador may be suffering some blowback.

The cost of insuring against a China sovereign default also continued to rise on Tuesday, with 5-year credit default swaps - which investors typically use as a hedge against rising risk - hitting their highest since April 2020.

Shares of several other property firms, however, fared better as markets bet on more loosening of policies following northeastern city of Harbin's measures to support developers and their projects. read more

Top developers Country Garden (2007.HK) and Sunac China (1918.HK) both rose 2% despite a 1% drop in the wider market (.SSEC).

Evergrande's electric vehicles unit (0708.HK) also jumped over 10% after it vowed to start producing cars next year. read more

NewsApi.org,"Summary Evergrande looks set to miss third round of bond payments

Some offshore bondholders have not had payment - sources

Modern Land asks investors to push back bond payment

Sinic warns it is likely to default next week

SHANGHAI/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chinese property firms' bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande (3333.HK) looked set to miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.

High-yield Chinese bond markets were routed once again as fears about fast-spreading contagion in the $5 trillion sector, which drives a sizable chunk of the Chinese economy, continued to savage sentiment.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping is launching inspections of financial institutions to see if private firms like Evergrande had been too close to state-owned banks, investment firms and financial regulators. Large lenders to Evergrande included financial conglomerate Citic, which is being scrutinized, the WSJ reported. Citic was not immediately available for comment. read more

Weary investors had been holding out little hope that Evergrande would suddenly stump up Monday's near $150 million of coupon payments, but the fact bondholders said they hadn't received anything this time either just bolstered expectations for a full-scale default.

""The key for offshore holders is the next couple of weeks and whether any payment or communication will come from the company in relation to its first missed offshore coupon,"" wrote Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA, at forex trading firm OANDA in a research note on Monday.

Erlam wrote that it was ""highly unlikely"" Evergrande would make the payment ""considering how the last two deadlines have gone"".

A spokesperson for Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment

Once China's largest developer, the firm has more than $300 billion in liabilities that are now at risk. read more

The cash-strapped property developer's troubles and contagion worries have sent shockwaves across global markets and the firm has already missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

CST Group Limited, an investment holding company, said in a statement on Monday that it sold 10.5% China Evergrande Notes and 11.5% China Evergrande Notes for $815,000 and $702,000.

Other signs of stress included smaller developer Modern Land (1107.HK) asking investors to push back by three months a $250 million bond payment due on Oct. 25 in part ""to avoid any potential payment default.""

Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) said it too was likely default next week as it didn't have enough financial resources to make its remaining bond payments this year. It has one at the start of next week, although that bond was already down 75%.

Modern Land's April 2023 bond with a coupon of 9.8% plunged more than 25% to 32.25 cents on the day, according to financial data provider Duration Finance, while the company's shares (1107.HK) have lost a third of their value over the last month.

Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, also saw some of its bonds slump to well under half their face value , . R&F Properties (2777.HK), and Greenland Holdings, which both have prestige projects in global cities like London, New York and Sydney, were also widely sold.

""It's a disastrous day,"" said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, highlighting how even some supposedly safer ""investment grade"" firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds.

""We think it's driven by global fund outflow .... Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.

Analysts at JPMorgan also highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold 'junk'-rated Chinese debt.

There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank's closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as ""onshore"" bonds.

""Evergrande's contagion risk is now spreading across other issuers and sectors,"" JPMorgan's analysts said.

Another London based analyst who asked not to be named said: ""Slowly and gradually we are seeing the rest of the Chinese property sector fall apart"".

Fantasia Group China Co, whose controlling shareholder is Fantasia Holdings, said on Monday it would adjust the trading mechanism of its Shanghai-traded bonds following credit downgrades by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI).

Fantasia (1777.HK) had appointed advisers on Friday after it shocked markets by missing a bond payment earlier in the week. It saw its bonds dive from almost 100 cents on the dollar to just 20 cents, as just a couple of weeks earlier it had said its liquidity was fine.

""We believe policymakers have zero tolerance for systemic risk to emerge and are aiming to maintain a stable property market, and policy support could be forthcoming if the deterioration in property activity levels worsen,"" said Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs.

""That said, we also believe that policymakers do not want to over-stimulate, and their longer term goal is to deleverage the property sector.""

HONG KONG, Oct 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China Evergrande (3333.HK) boss Hui Ka Yan has just had yet another of his bubbles burst. Last year he suggested in a leaked letter that his property-developing empire was too big to fail. On Friday, though, the country’s central bank decided the beleaguered company is a bad apple in an otherwise ""healthy"" industry. That’s too generous, but the regulator is right that the chance of a domestic systemic financial crisis is falling.

The message read more from Zou Lan, a senior official at the People's Bank of China is clear for investors: The government is keeping its hands off. Despite urging faster asset disposal to deliver unfinished apartments , Zou defined Evergrande's mistakes as purely operational and dismissed Hui's creditors as ""relatively dispersed"". That probably came as the result of stress tests that the central bank has been quietly conducting with banks and other financial institutions.

Evergrande will, though, cause more pain. Hui is already struggling to offload office buildings read more and other assets without a big haircut. And defaults have started to snowball across the industry. On Friday China Properties joined a dozen others that have defaulted on over 47 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) of bonds this year, per an estimate from CRIC, a Chinese property consultancy. S&P Global last week downgraded two of the bigger players, Greenland (600606.SS) and E-house Enterprise (2048.HK).

But for more sanguine players like Longfor (0960.HK), which remains clear of the debt red lines but whose stock has fallen 24% this year, the risk of becoming collateral damage is much lower. Overly tightened credit policies will probably be corrected on the margin, too, as Zou criticised some lenders for misunderstanding the central bank’s debt control policies.

Smaller, more vulnerable developers remain the weak link. The analogy Zou drew to the shock default of Yongcheng Coal last year and interbank market panic following the Baoshang Bank takeover in 2019 suggests Beijing is willing to stomach some pain for proper deterrence. Chinese property firms have 1.28 trillion yuan of debt due this year, and total bond issuance was 21% lower in the first eight months of the year, according to Beike Research Institute. The relative resilience of the majority of the industry, though, suggests the light at the end of the tunnel is drawing nearer.

CONTEXT NEWS

- China Evergrande’s problems are isolated and not representative of the country’s broader real estate industry, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People's Bank of China, said at a briefing on Oct. 15. Most companies in the sector are operating steadily and have good financials, he argued. Zou also said that the risk of Evergrande’s debt problems spilling over to the financial sector is controllable, as its financial liabilities are less than one-third of total liabilities and each of its many creditors’ exposure is limited.

- “Relevant departments” and local governments are carrying out “de-risking” work at Evergrande based on market-driven principles in accordance with the law, urging it to step up asset disposal efforts, restart project constructions, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of home buyers, Zou said.

- Some lenders have had “misunderstandings"" about the central bank’s debt control policies, causing financial strains for some developers, Zou said.

- Chinese state-owned property developer Yuexiu has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande’s Hong Kong headquarters over worries that Evergrande's unresolved indebtedness would create complications in completing the transaction smoothly, Reuters reported on Oct. 15 citing sources.

Summary <a href=""https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E"">Graphic: World FX rates</a>

LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged lower on Friday and is set for a second consecutive week of decline as news that heavily indebted property firm China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) had averted a default buoyed appetite for risky assets.

With markets nearly discounting the prospects of a first U.S. rate hike by next July in recent days, the dollar has become more sensitive to risk sentiment. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading just below April highs.

On a weekly basis though, the antipodean currencies including the Aussie and the kiwi are the clear winners followed by the Norwegian crown as investors pumped money into stocks and high-yielding currencies.

""The winners tell us that risk sentiment is thriving, despite 10- year note yields closing in on April's highs. If higher yields don't damage sentiment, then yields will go on rising,"" said Kit Juckes, a currency strategist at Societe Generale.

Concerns over Evergrande, the embattled property developer whose liabilities are equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, had sent investors flocking to the perceived safe-haven currencies like the U.S. dollar and government debt.

Worries of economic contagion have seen swathes of other heavily indebted developers hit with credit rating downgrades.

But days before a deadline that would have plunged the developer into formal default and sent shockwaves through global markets, the company supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond. read more

""So while this is good news in terms of a formal imminent default being avoided over the weekend, uncertainty is set to remain high until there is further clarity on Evergrande’s position and the position of other property companies in China,"" MUFG strategists said in a daily note.

The dollar index edged 0.1% lower to 93.62, putting it on track for a second straight week of falls.

But the broader market narrative remained supportive of more U.S. dollar gains as rising bond yields on the back of firmer inflation expectations are expected to lend support to the greenback. Yield differentials between comparable U.S. and German debt held at a chunky 177 bps.

Moreover, rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be among the leaders to tighten monetary policy before other major central banks is also prompting investors like UBS Wealth Management to keep the dollar as its most preferred currency in its portfolio.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was at $0.7503, up 0.5% on the day, nearing Thursday's three-month top, as the boost to the China-exposed currency from Evergrande's news was outweighed by action from the Reserve Bank of Australia to stem a bond sell-off, as well as the pause in energy price rises.

The RBA said on Friday it had stepped in to defend its yield target for the first time in eight months, spending A$1 billion ($750 million) to dampen an aggressive bonds sell-off as traders have bet on inflation pulling forward rate hikes.

Elsewhere, the euro was little changed at $1.1639 , while the yen wobbled within sight of its multi-year lows, with one dollar worth 113.83 yen, compared with 114.69 earlier in the week, a four-year low.

NewsApi.org,"SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Friday, led by property shares, as China Evergrande Group unexpectedly supplied funds for a bond interest payment, while comments from the banking regulator also underpinned the property market.

Evergrande has supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default. Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment.

But energy and mining shares fell, as coal futures extended losses after Beijing signalled it would intervene to cool surging prices that contributed to the country’s electricity shortage.

China’s blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.9% in morning trade, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1% as the Evergrande news helped improve sentiment. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.4%.

“In the short term, we believe the interest repayment should provide a fillip to Chinese risk assets, including the yuan and Chinese equities,” said Wei Liang Chang, Macro Strategist at DBS Bank, Singapore.

“Evergrande default risks, though not dissipated, have likely been deferred for some time.”

Sentiment in the sector, which had been badly hurt by Evergrande’s debt crisis, also recovered after China’s banking regulator on Thursday urged lenders to fulfil credit needs for basic demand and support mortgage lending to first-home buyers.

“We note regulators have softened tones to prevent over-tightening on property, and witness marginally easing measures on property-related loans,” Citi said in a research note, expecting the mortgage rate in certain regions to fall over time.

The average mortgage rate in China’s major cities declined in October, the first monthly drop this year, Caixin reported on Friday, citing Beike Research Institute.

HONG KONG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Developer China Evergrande Group has made an interest payment for an offshore bond before a grace period expired on Friday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, narrowly averting a catastrophic default for the second time in a week.

Evergrande (3333.HK), once China's top-selling developer, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, fuelling worries about the impact of its fate on the world's second-largest economy as well as on global markets. read more

The property developer, which staved off a default last week by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond, needed to make $47.5 million in coupon payments to bondholders by Friday.

A failure to pay by the Friday deadline would have triggered cross-defaults on all of the company's $19 billion worth of bonds in international capital markets, in what would have been the world's second-largest emerging market corporate debt default.

Evergrande did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The people declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Reuters was not able to determine the source of the funds used to make the interest payments. Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that Chinese authorities had urged Evergrande's founder, Hui Ka Yan, to pay the developer's debts out of his personal wealth.

Shares of Evergrande gave up early gains to fall about 0.8% by late morning on Friday, versus a 0.3% decline in the Hang Seng Index (.HSI). The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI) fell about 0.9%, while an index of developers' mainland A-shares (.CSI000952) dropped 3.6%.

Prices of the developer's bonds jumped higher on Friday, with its 11.5% January 2023 bond surging more than 9%, and its 12% January 2024 bond up nearly 8% on the day, data from Duration Finance showed.

That still left them trading at discounts of more than 75% from their face value, with the 2023 bond yielding nearly 190%.

One bondholder said he maintained a negative outlook for the developer despite it making the coupon payment.

""I only think they are buying time at this point,"" the bondholder said.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.

It still has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming due in November and December.

The New York Times earlier reported that the developer made an interest payment, citing a person speaking on condition of anonymity.

""Evergrande has tried its best to solve liquidity problems, but it's a little bit difficult to gather enough capital to pay all the debt,"" said Cliff Zhao, chief strategist at China Construction Bank International in Hong Kong.

""I think there (will) be some negotiations between Evergrande and its lenders, so some sort of haircut is still possible. The market still needs some time to digest and to price this in.""

DEBT CRISIS

Evergrande's woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value, leading some analysts to consider default at some point inevitable. read more

Even as Evergrande secures funds to make payments, other Chinese developers whose fortunes have been hit by market concerns over Evergrande's debt crisis have slid into formal default.

Fantasia Holdings Group Co Ltd (1777.HK), Sinic Holdings (Group) Co Ltd (2103.HK), China Properties Group Ltd (1838.HK) and Modern Land (China) Co Ltd (1107.HK) have all defaulted on dollar debt obligations this month.

Other developers with significant dollar debt have proposed extending offshore bond maturities or undertaking debt restructuring in a meeting with regulators, sources have said. read more

In a meeting with developers this week, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange told developers facing large offshore debt maturities to evaluate repayment risk and report difficulties.

The NDRC also implored developers to meet offshore debt obligations, and maintain their reputations and market order. read more

""Selective defaults in the offshore market are emphatically not acceptable for the authorities, and the NDRC clarification this week should reassure offshore investors that they will be treated fairly alongside onshore investors,"" DBS strategist Wei Liang Chang said in a client note.

Even developers who have not defaulted have seen their share and bond prices walloped. On Friday, Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd (0127.HK) said it would book an aggregate loss of HK$1.36 billion in the current fiscal year from the sale of all of its bonds issued by peer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd (1638.HK).

Concerns over the systemic impact of a default by Evergrande have widened spreads on Chinese high-yield dollar debt (.MERACYC) to record levels as investors demand higher risk premiums.

Investor worries have also kept the cost of insuring against default on China's sovereign debt elevated. That cost earlier this month touched its highest level since the height of the pandemic in 2020.

BANK EXPOSURE

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, Evergrande epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over the fate of more than 1,300 real estate projects it has ongoing in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.

A leaked 2020 document, branded fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the developer's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK), a former major shareholder of embattled developer China Evergrande (3333.HK), jumped as much as 32% on Thursday after it announced an offer to be taken private for HK$1.91 billion ($245 million).

The Hong Kong developer said on Wednesday the family of Chinese Estates' biggest shareholder, Joseph Lau, had proposed to take it private by offering minority shareholders a 38% premium to its last traded price.

The offer represents the latest move by Lau and China Estates to emerge from the shadow of Evergrande, which is floundering due to a huge debt load and threatening the Hong Kong company's future.

Formerly Evergrande's second-biggest shareholder, Chinese Estates has already slashed its holding over the past few months to 4.39% from 6.48%. It has flagged a goal to exit the holding completely and estimates a loss of HK$10.41 billion for the current year from the stake disposal. read more

Eugene Law, business development director of China Galaxy International Financial, said as a listed company Chinese Estates would need to keep updating on its position in Evergrande and ""it does not want that trouble"".

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Chinese Estates' shares rose to HK$3.81 by noon. They resumed trading on Thursday after being suspended on Sept. 29.

Shares of the Hong Kong developer were down 42% this year before the trading suspension, dragged down by unrealized losses in its investment in Evergrande whose stock took a hit due to liquidity crisis and default risks.

Shares of Chinese Estates/Evergrande

In a statement late on Wednesday, Chinese Estates said its stock price may be further affected by Evergrande, as it is ""cautious and concerned"" about recent developments at the Chinese developer.

A delisting would reduce the costs and management resources to maintain the listing status, Chinese Estates added, and it could provide more flexibility to implement long-term business strategies.

Other than Evergrande, Chinese Estates said it also has significant investments in another Chinese developer, Kaisa Group (1638.HK), whose shares have also suffered falls over the past few months on wider liquidity concerns about China's real estate sector.

Chinese Estates' former chairman Lau has been a major backer of Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan and is a member of the so-called ""poker club"" of Hong Kong tycoons that includes Hui. read more

Lau, whose family owns about 75% of Chinese Estates' equity capital, resigned as its chairman and chief executive in 2014 after he was found guilty of bribery and money laundering charges in the gambling hub of Macau.

STOCKHOLM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Swedish electric vehicle unit of China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) is in talks with U.S. and European venture capital firms and industrial partners to find new owners, its top chief said, as its Chinese parent battles default on more than $300 billion in debts.

National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB (NEVS), owned by the cash-strapped Chinese property developer, has funds to last ""for a good while"", its Chief Executive Stefan Tilk said, adding that several investors were showing interest in the firm.

He declined to comment on a possible valuation. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the unit could be valued at as much as $1 billion.

Evergrande has already missed three rounds of interest payments on its international bonds, and has been scrambling to sell some of its assets to raise cash. read more

The Chinese property developer has spent billions of dollars on stakes in automobile technology developers, including NEVS. It also has joint ventures with Germany's Hofer and Sweden's Koenigsegg.

NEVS, which received an electric vehicle production licence in China four years ago, is the Swedish arm of Evergrande's EV unit Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group (0708.HK).

Tilk said that NEVS is discussing a potential sale or other financing mainly with European and U.S. firms, but declined to name them.

""We are in dialogue both with venture people and companies that have the same idea and direction as us and want to get into this with our full competence,"" he told Reuters. ""So they are both industrial partners and venture capitalists.""

Evergrande NEV warned in stock exchange filings last month that it was still looking for new investors and to make asset sales, and that without either it may struggle to pay employee salaries and cover other expenses.

Tilk added that NEVS, which gave notice of redundancy to nearly half its roughly 650 workers in August, could hire staff again to get the competence Evergrande wants in Europe if it survives the crisis.

""If Evergrande can continue its operations, which they hope to do, they will be interested in having a footprint in Europe, with infrastructure like a plant, tests, lab. And we have that,"" he said.

In the meantime NEVS, which bought carmaker Saab's assets in 2012, is focusing on building its mobility ecosystem PONS, an autonomous ride-sharing network for smart cities and university campuses.

Evergrande, which is facing one of the country's largest defaults as it wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt, has already missed coupon payments on dollar bonds twice last month. read more

The missed payments, worth a combined $131 million, have left global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when 30-day grace periods end for coupons that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

NewsApi.org,"Summary Evergrande formally abandons stake sale

Officials out in force giving assurances

Property firm bonds generally recover

Weak firms remain in firing line

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Teetering Chinese property giant China Evergrande (3333.HK) formally abandoned plans to sell a $2.6 billion stake in one of its key units on Wednesday, as Beijing officials went out in force to say the problems would not spin out of control.

Once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300 billion of debt, Evergrande was in talks to sell a 50.1% stake in its Evergrande Property Services arm (6666.HK) to smaller rival Hopson Development Holdings (0754.HK).

In a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday, Evergrande said that the company had reason to believe that Hopson had not met the ""prerequisite to make a general offer"" for its unit without elaborating further.

In a separate exchange filing, Evergrande said barring its sale of a stake worth $1.5 billion in Chinese lender Shengjing Bank Co (2066.HK), it had made no material progress in selling other assets it has put on the block.

Evergrande's disclosures came after a number of top Chinese officials had sought to reassure homebuyers and markets that the current woes in the property sector would not be allowed to turn into a full-scale crisis.

Worries that a cash crunch at Evergrande, whose liabilities are equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, could cause economic contagion have seen swathes of other heavily-indebted developers hit with credit rating downgrades, while some smaller ones have already defaulted.

In comments reported by state media Xinhua and echoing words from the country's central bank late last week, Vice Premier Liu He told a Beijing forum on Wednesday that the risks were controllable, and that reasonable capital demand from property firms was being met.

The chairman of China's securities regulator, Yi Huiman, added at the same forum that authorities would properly handle the default risks and look to curb excessive debt more broadly.

""(We need) to improve the effectiveness of the constraint mechanism on debt financing, to avoid excessive financing through 'high leverage',"" Yi said.

Chinese property developers have total outstanding debt of 33.5 trillion yuan ($5.24 trillion), according to Nomura, equivalent to roughly a third of the country's gross domestic product.

Evergrande, which has epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, amid expectations it is about to formally default on one of its international bonds.

In its Wednesday filing, Evergrande said it would continue to implement measures ""to ease the liquidity issues"" and would use best efforts to negotiate for the renewal or extension of its borrowings with its creditors.

""In view of the difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in improving its liquidity, there is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations under the relevant financing documents and other contracts,"" it said.

Creditors have so far said there has been no contact from Evergrande despite weeks of effort on their behalf. Evergrande will officially be in default if it doesn't make an already- overdue March 2022 bond coupon payment by Monday.

China property stocks come crashing down

BLAME GAME

Sources told Reuters on Tuesday Evergrande had been forced to shelve its property services unit stake sale to Hopson after failing to win the blessing of the Guangdong provincial government, which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.

Some of Evergrande's international creditors had also opposed the deal, one of them said. If companies sell assets just before they collapse, creditors have less to claw their money back with.

There was a blame game starting too though.

Hopson said in an exchange filing that it had been prepared to complete the deal but had received a transaction termination notice from Evergrande on Oct. 13.

Evergrande, Evergrande Property Services, and Hopson, which have had trading in their shares suspended since Oct. 4 pending the deal announcement, all said they had requested for their shares to resume trading in Hong Kong from Thursday.

The sale setback for Evergrande comes after Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy its Hong Kong headquarters last week. read more

REBUILDING PROCESS

Pan Gongsheng, head of China's foreign exchange regulator, added to a chorus of officials trying to soothe concerns, saying excessive tightening by financial institutions and markets on the property sector was being gradually corrected, financial magazine Yicai reported.

Those comments followed a speech by People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang, who said on Sunday that the world's second-largest economy is ""doing well"" but faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement."" read more

A transcript of the comments released by the PBOC on Wednesday showed Yi also saying that China will fully respect and protect the legal rights of Evergrande's creditors and asset owners, in line with ""repayment priorities"" laid out by China's laws.

Strong demand at a sale of Chinese government bonds on Wednesday showed there was no sign of the troubles impacting the wider markets.

The official reassurances in recent days and some coupon payments from other major developers, helped China high-yield debt spreads (.MERACYC) continue to improve after hitting record high levels last week.

There was an increasingly stark divide though. While many firms saw their bond prices continue to regain ground, Kaisa group, which was the first Chinese real estate firm to default in 2015, saw its bonds hit new record lows.

Central China Real Estate became the latest to see its credit rating chopped, and like many of its peers in recent days, was immediately warned that it could happen again too.

NewsApi.org,"Summary Evergrande looks set to miss third round of bond payments

Some offshore bondholders have not had payment - sources

Modern Land asks investors to push back bond payment

Sinic warns it is likely to default next week

SHANGHAI/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chinese property firms' bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande (3333.HK) looked set to miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.

High-yield Chinese bond markets were being routed once again as fears about fast-spreading contagion in the $5 trillion sector, which drives a sizable chunk of the Chinese economy, continued to savage sentiment.

Weary investors had been holding out little hope that Evergrande would suddenly stump up Monday's near $150 million of coupon payments, but the fact bondholders said they hadn't received anything this time either just bolstered expectations for a full-scale default.

Once China's largest developer, the firm has more than $300 billion in liabilities that are now at risk. read more

Other signs of stress included smaller developer Modern Land (1107.HK) asking investors to push back by three months a $250 million bond payment due on Oct. 25 in part ""to avoid any potential payment default.""

Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) said it too was likely default next week as it didn't have enough financial resources to make its remaining bond payments this year. It has one at the start of next week, although that bond was already down 75%.

Modern Land's April 2023 bond with a coupon of 9.8% plunged more than 25% to 32.25 cents on the day, according to financial data provider Duration Finance, while the company's shares (1107.HK) have lost a third of their value over the last month.

Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, also saw some of its bonds slump to well under half their face value , . R&F Properties (2777.HK), and Greenland Holdings, which both have prestige projects in global cities like London, New York and Sydney, were also widely sold.

""It's a disastrous day,"" said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, highlighting how even some supposedly safer ""investment grade"" firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds.

""We think it's driven by global fund outflow .... Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.

Analysts at JPMorgan also highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold 'junk'-rated Chinese debt.

There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank's closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as ""onshore"" bonds.

""Evergrande's contagion risk is now spreading across other issuers and sectors,"" JPMorgan's analysts said.

Another London based analyst who asked not to be named said: ""Slowly and gradually we are seeing the rest of the Chinese property sector fall apart"".

Fantasia Group China Co, whose controlling shareholder is Fantasia Holdings, said on Monday it would adjust the trading mechanism of its Shanghai-traded bonds following credit downgrades by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI).

Fantasia (1777.HK) had appointed advisers on Friday after it shocked markets by missing a bond payment earlier in the week. It saw its bonds dive from almost 100 cents on the dollar to just 20 cents, as just a couple of weeks earlier it had said its liquidity was fine.

""We believe policymakers have zero tolerance for systemic risk to emerge and are aiming to maintain a stable property market, and policy support could be forthcoming if the deterioration in property activity levels worsen,"" said Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs.

""That said, we also believe that policymakers do not want to over-stimulate, and their longer term goal is to deleverage the property sector.""

SHANGHAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Shares and bonds of Chinese real estate companies slid on Thursday, reflecting uncertainty about how a debt crisis will play out at China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) and the wider property sector as another developer was hit by a rating downgrade.

Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities and 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week.

The world's most indebted developer, which has been trying to sell assets to raise funds, appeared to have made small progress towards that goal when Qumei Home Furnishings Group (603818.SS) announced in a filing on Thursday that it will buy out Evergrande group's 40% stake in their furnishings joint venture for 72 million yuan ($11.18 million).

But in a sign of its continued cash flow problems, municipal officials in Changchun said Evergrande has yet to make $28 million payment for land it acquired in the northeastern city earlier this year. read more

Other Chinese developers have also warned they could default on bond payments, and rising risks on Wednesday led credit rating agency S&P Global to downgrade two of the sector's bigger companies, Greenland Holdings (600606.SS) - which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers - and E-house (2048.HK). S&P also said it could cut their ratings further. read more

On Thursday, Fitch Ratings issued the latest downgrade, cutting Modern Land (China) Co (1107.HK) to a single-C rating after the developer said it was seeking consent from investors to extend a bond's maturity date by three months.

Investors have been hoping China would ease monetary policy to stabilise its wobbly recovery, but data on Thursday showed China's annual factory gate prices rising at the fastest pace on record in September due to soaring raw material costs. read more

Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said persistent inflationary pressure would limit the scope of any monetary policy easing.

""But the most important policy in the property sector is not monetary policy, but the regulation related to leverage and bank loan supply to developers (and) home buyers,"" he said.

""Therefore I think the government still has the option to loosen those policies to help the property sector,"" Zhang said.

""The big question is whether they are willing to do so. So far their policy stance seems quite firm.""

On Thursday, a sub-index tracking shares of Chinese property developers (.CSI000952) ended the day down 3.88%, while the broad CSI300 blue-chip index (.CSI300) slipped 0.54%. Property shares have fallen nearly 20% this year, compared with a 5.7% fall for the CSI300.

JPMorgan analysts said China property shares would remain volatile in the near term.

""News on marginal easing will likely cause a short-term rebound, which, however, may not be very sustainable due to the likely ongoing concerns on the offshore bond market,"" they said.

""A more sustainable rally may happen in January 2022 when banks have more front-loaded quota to extend credit to developers/mortgages.""

China property shares vs blue-chips

LIGHTNING RODS

In China's onshore bond market there was still a lot of price volatility, with bonds of developer Shanghai Shimao (600823.SS) listed among both the biggest gainers and biggest losers on the day by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

""Property bonds are lightning rods,"" said a director at a local brokerage. Apart from the risk of debt contagion from Evergrande, higher mortgage rates - part of official efforts to rein in surging housing prices - are hitting the industry, he said. ""Fundamentally, the high turnover of real estate companies is gone.""

In international debt markets, data provider Duration Finance showed Greenland Group Holdings' 6.75% June 2022 bond was trading down more than 3 points at 60.175 cents, and Xinyuan Real Estate's 14.5% September 2023 bond slumped nearly 8 points to 63.9 cents.

Markets in Hong Kong were closed on Thursday for a public holiday.

Worries about the potential for spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader global economy kept the spread - or risk premium - on investment-grade Chinese companies (.MERACCG), which tend to have the most solid finances, near its widest in more than two months late on Wednesday.

The spread on the equivalent high-yield or junk-rated index (.MERACYC) that tracks companies such as Evergrande pulled back on Wednesday, but remained close to all-time highs.

Evergrande asset sale fails, default deadline looms

Oil prices fall

NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes were down slightly on Thursday as U.S. technology shares fell along with IBM, while risk-sensitive currencies including the Australian dollar weakened.

Evergrande due to pay nearly $150 mln in coupons next week

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) offshore bondholders are concerned that it is close to defaulting on debt payments and want more information and transparency from the cash-strapped property developer, their advisers said.

Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's largest defaults as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and whose troubles have already sent shockwaves across global markets, missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, offshore investors have been left wondering if they will face large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods for last month's coupons. [nL8N2QP1H5]

A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them. read more

Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis.

""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.

""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he said

Evergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Neil McDonald, a restructuring partner in the Hong Kong office of Kirkland & Ellis, said the bondholders would like more transparency, and hoped Evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under stock listing rules.

The offshore bondholders are also demanding more information about Evergrande's plan to divest some businesses and how the proceeds would be used, the advisers said, adding that the creditors group they represent was growing.

The two advisers said that, including the parties that have expressed an interest to be part of the group, they represent bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds.

Evergrande said last month it would sell a $1.5-billion stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd (2066.HK). The bank, one of Evergrande's main lenders, demanded cash from the sale go towards settling the developer's debts with Shengjing.

Trading in Evergrande shares has been halted since Monday pending a major deal announcement. Trading in its Evergrande Property Services Group (6666.HK) unit was also halted.

China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development (0754.HK) was to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing other media reports.

""Whilst we don't want to overstate this, we are obviously at this point in time preparing contingency plans to ensure that there are no dissipation of assets,"" McDonald said.

""And if there is such activity, we will be prepared to take steps to protect the rights and interests of U.S. creditors, and we really hope that that's not necessary,"" he added.

The advisers for offshore Evergrande bondholders had reached the developer on Sept. 16, but had not received any assurance from the developer, demanding more transparency.

SECTOR SLUMP

In another development, Evergrande dollar-bond trustee Citi (C.N) has hired law firm Mayer Brown as counsel, a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters earlier on Friday.

Citi and Mayer Brown declined to comment.

The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.

With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday.

""The potential lack of transparency and clarity are leaving investors more skittish and it will be very difficult for people to want to refinance any debt coming due in that particular sector,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.

An index tracking China's property sector (.CSI000952) dropped 1.53%, against a 1.31% blue-chip share rise (.CSI300).

The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading of two bonds issued by smaller developer Fantasia Group China Co, with one dropping more than 50%, after controlling shareholder Fantasia Holdings Group (1777.HK) missed the deadline on a $206 million international market debt payment on Monday.

Fantasia Holding said in a stock exchange filing on Friday that it had appointed Houlihan Lokey and Sidley Austin as its advisers to assess its capital structure, evaluate liquidity and explore solutions to ease its current liquidity issue.

Most of Evergrande and Fantasia's bonds have already lost around 80% of their value.

Meanwhile, bonds issued by Greenland Holdings (0337.HK), which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers including in Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, and Kaisa Group both took another beating on Friday. L8N2R433Z.

""Market participants are questioning if this may be a precursor for voluntary defaults by other developers with healthy short-term liquidity positions, but large unsustainable longer-term debt,"" Chang Wei Liang, Credit & FX Strategist at DBS Bank, said in a note.

SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar found support just below last week's peaks on Monday as renewed concerns about China's property sector and looming U.S. labour data put investors in a cautious mood.

The greenback scaled a 14-month high on the euro and a 19-month top on the yen last week as markets reckoned U.S. interest rates could rise ahead of global peers.

Shares in embattled developer China Evergrande (3333.HK) were halted in Hong Kong without any immediate reason, rekindling market nerves about the possibility of global contagion - or at least distress in China's property sector. read more

The euro dipped back below $1.16 and at $1.1595 is not far from last week's trough at $1.1563. The yen edged higher to 110.99 per dollar. Sterling, the Aussie and kiwi all eased a fraction and the offshore yuan fell 0.3%.

Investors are concerned that a collapse at Evergrande could hurt an already fragile Chinese economy and drag on global growth. The U.S. dollar index rose 0.1% to 94.049. The Australian dollar was down 0.2% to $0.7257 and the kiwi was off 0.1% at $0.6932.

""(There's) a bit of nervousness,"" said Moh Siong Sim, currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore, even if most traders still think Evergrande's systemic risk can be contained.

""It's part of the wall of worry,"" he said, which the market could eventually ""climb"" if the COVID backdrop improves, growth stabilises and inflation concerns subside, but which for now is keeping investor sentiment fairly dour.

Besides Evergrande a Friday CNBC report which said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will announce on Monday that China is not complying with U.S.-China trade rules also provided support to the dollar, especially against the yuan.

Chinese markets were closed for a holiday.

In the week ahead, the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday and is expected to keep policy steady. Across the Tasman, a 25 basis point hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday is priced in.

And on Friday, U.S. labour data is expected to show continued improvement in the job market, with a forecast for 460,000 jobs to have been added in September - enough to keep the Federal Reserve on course to begin tapering before year's end.

""The question is whether there is a number that alters the Fed's view on tapering its bond purchases in November, and what a really weak or hot number means amid the backdrop of rising stagflation fears,"" said Pepperstone's head of research, Chris Weston.

""If U.S. treasuries find further buyers this week into Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls, the dollar may go on sale this week.""

Elsewhere economists polled by Reuters expect the cash rate on hold in Australia until at least 2024, as the RBA has been insisting it will be.

Swaps markets show a 97% probability of a rate hike in New Zealand on Wednesday and a 96% chance of another one in November.

Sterling, meanwhile, despite Friday gains, is still nursing losses from a sharp drawdown last week when traders shrugged off hawkish central bank rhetoric to focus on a sour outlook and the risk of both higher rates and inflation.

""Investors are judging the UK by its whole suite of fundamentals factors and movements in sterling suggest that many are not liking what they are seeing,"" said Rabobank strategist Jane Foley, as the currency erases early 2021 gains.

""The UK no longer has an advantage on the vaccine front...and, while PM (Boris) Johnson likes to view Brexit as 'done', many businesses and commentators are only just starting to evaluate its impact.""

Sterling last bought $1.1353.

Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) has rapidly become Beijing's biggest corporate headache as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and the fate of the country's second-biggest property developer is keeping global markets on tenterhooks.

A string of Beijing officials have tried to reassure investors the crisis will not spiral out of control and that creditors' interests will be protected, but its long-term impact on China's property sector and economy is highly uncertain. read more

Here's what you need to know about China's property sector:

HOW BIG IS IT?

The sector is the largest contributor to China's gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for more than a quarter when related industries are included, economists say.

A vast ecosystem of suppliers and service providers has flourished around giant property developers and real estate has played a crucial role in creating jobs and generating cash for local governments. Land sales in China account for a third of their revenues, which stood at 27.3 trillion yuan ($4.3 trillion) in 2020, according to Japanese bank Nomura.

Property accounts for 40% of the assets owned by Chinese households, according to Macquarie, raising concerns that if the bubble bursts, consumers would feel less wealthy and turn more thrifty, which would hit other sectors of the economy.

The value of nationwide land sales slumped 17.5% in August from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations using finance ministry data, the biggest slide since February 2020. read more

GHOST TOWNS

China has about 65 million empty homes, which is equivalent to the total number of households in France and the United Kingdom combined, due to a massive building boom and rampant speculation.

Betting on sustained growth, a huge proportion of China's 1.4 billion people - some estimates say about 70% - have money tied up in residential property. According to the Chinese central bank, 93.6% of urban households owned homes last year, one of the highest rates in the world.

The real estate market has continued to expand because investors, developers and home buyers have generally believed that the sector is too crucial to the economy for the government to allow any significant correction.

DEBT MOUNTAIN

China's property sector is heavily reliant on credit and many developers are struggling under the weight of debt. As of the end of the second quarter, Chinese developers owed 33.5 trillion yuan ($5 trillion), or a third of the country's GDP, up more than two-fold from 2015, according to Nomura.

The sector's outstanding debt is roughly equivalent to the GDP of Japan, the world's third-largest economy.

Bonds worth $92.3 billion issued by Chinese developers are due in the next year, Refinitiv data shows. Bond defaults have jumped in recent quarters, from 5.5 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2020 to 21.5 billion as of mid-August, Nomura says.

EVERGRANDE

Founded in 1996, Evergrande's debt of more than $300 billion is equivalent roughly to the GDP of South Africa and bigger than Finland's. The developer has more than 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 Chinese cities. Now the world's most indebted developer, Evergrande has $19 billion worth of bonds on international capital markets.

PROPERTY SALES

In 2020, sales of residential housing rose 3.2% to 1,549 million square metres from a year earlier, with sales by value up 10.8% to 15.5 trillion yuan, according to China's statistics bureau. That compares with 970.3 million square metres sold in 2011 for 4.9 trillion yuan.

But China's property market started to slow in 2021, recording the longest downtrend since 2015 in new construction starts, while property sales by floor area dropped 15.8% in September, the third monthly decline in a row. read more

HOME PRICES AND INVENTORIES

House prices in China have soared over the past decade. They vary greatly across regions within China but, on average, prices have risen 99% to 9,980 yuan per square metre in 2020 from 5,011 yuan in 2011, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the statistics bureau.

At the end of September, unsold inventories of homes stood at 224.2 million square metres, according to the statistics bureau - or roughly twice the size of the Channel Island of Jersey. Unsold inventories stood at 223.8 million square metres at the end of 2020.

HOUSEHOLD LOANS

At the end of June, outstanding domestic and foreign currency household loans, the majority of which were mortgages, stood at 67.8 trillion yuan ($10.6 trillion), according to the latest data from the People's Bank of China.

The rescue of embattled Chinese property company Evergrande appears to have stalled, leaving the developer on the brink of default and threatening to unleash contagion through the country’s giant real estate sector, home prices and the economy.

The problems enveloping Evergrande, which has eyewatering total debts of $305bn, have hung over global financial markets in recent weeks and helped curb China’s post-pandemic recovery.

But the crisis could deepen further if Evergrande fails to meet a deadline of Monday to stump up a $83.5m bond interest payment, triggering an official default.

Evergrande has already been given a 30-day grace period to make the repayment after missing the initial deadline back in September. It has since missed other key offshore, dollar-denominated bond payments worth another $193.3m. The clock is now ticking on those debts as well.

The sprawling property-to-electric-cars empire founded by former steel executive Xu Jiayin in the mid-90s has been scrambling to offload assets in order to pay back some of its loans. Its Chinese creditors are expected to be prioritised, with foreign investors at the back of the queue.

Shares in its main Hong Kong listing have lost 80% in the past year and have been suspended since 4 October pending an announcement on how it is going to be rescued.

But there were signs that the process has not been running to plan, raising the prospect that Beijing will be forced to engineer a dismantling of Evergrande, the country’s second-biggest developer, by absorbing most of it into existing state-owned enterprises.

First, Evergrande’s negotiations to sell its 51% stake in its profitable property management unit, Evergrande Property Services Group, to another Chinese developer for $2.6bn have been suspended, according to reports. The buyer, Hopson Development Holdings, reportedly could not obtain the necessary agreement from the provincial government in Guangdong, which is overseeing Evergrande’s restructuring.

The sale of Evergrande’s 26-storey waterfront headquarters in Hong Kong was expected to raise another $1.7bn but the deal with Yuexiu has also reportedly been placed on hold for the same reason.

The state of the property market, which accounts for about 25% of the Chinese economy, makes for an alarming backdrop to these problems. Home sales by value tumbled 16.9% in September from a year earlier, after a 19.7% drop in August, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data released on Monday.

With many other developers also feeling the squeeze and struggling to repay loans, the potentially colossal default of Evergrande could capsize the weakest, most debt-laden parts of the property sector.

China Properties joined a dozen others that have defaulted on over 47bn yuan ($7.3bn) of bonds this year, per an estimate from CRIC, a Chinese property consultancy, Reuters reported on Friday. S&P Global last week downgraded two of the bigger players, Greenland, which has extensive developments in London, Sydney and New York, and E-house Enterprise.

A smaller developer, Sinic Holdings, became the latest to have its rating put in “selective default” by S&P after it defaulted on $246m in bonds, having warned it was likely to do so last week.

Terry Chan, a senior research fellow at S&P Global Ratings, said the situation risked exposing other large Chinese companies that have expanded in similarly rapid fashion on the back of the three decades of debt-fuelled, breakneck economic growth.

“Should Evergrande default, there may be contagion effects for other developers, home prices, and the economy. Evergrande’s cashflow troubles foreshadow what could go wrong for liquidity-challenged Chinese corporates,” he said.

China’s corporate sector accounts for almost a third (31%) of global corporate debt, according a survey by S&P of 25,000 companies across the world. The sector’s debt-to-GDP leverage ratio of 159% is one of the world’s highest – the current global ratio is 101% – and presents a staggering $27tn headache for Beijing.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, has shown in recent years that he is determined to tackle the issue as he pursues his goal of “common prosperity”. He has clipped the wings of tech billionaires such as Jack Ma with firms forced to offload assets and concede control over data to regulators. Highly profitable private tutoring services beloved by China’s ambitious city-dwelling parents have been outlawed too.

Now the property sector’s “speculative” model is in Xi’s sights. Last year’s “three red lines” for balance sheets made it much more difficult for large developers such as Evergrande to secure the funding to keep the plates spinning on its borrow-and-build model.

However, Angus Coote of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne, Australia, said China’s central bank was “on the front foot”, flooding the market with liquidity – another 100bn yuan ($15.6bn) on Wednesday – and would contain the contagion.

“Banks have been told to keep lending to healthy developers,” he said. “The biggest ones can cause a ripple effect … but it’s manageable without any contagion is our view. Beijing is going to let it down slowly.”

Helge Berger, head of the International Monetary Fund’s China arm, told Bloomberg the risks to the wider economy had been “contained”(£) for now but that authorities should continue to monitor in case of escalation.

Summary Central bank makes rare comments on Evergrande debt situation

PBOC: financial firms don't have concentrated Evergrande risk

Evergrande CEO holds restructuring talks in Hong Kong with banks

Xinyuan Real Estate agrees to exchange offer with bondholders

Evergrande has 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities

SHANGHAI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The spillover effect of China Evergrande Group's debt problems on the banking system is controllable, a central bank official said on Friday, in rare official comments on a liquidity crisis at China's No. 2 developer that has roiled global markets.

Chinese authorities are urging Evergrande to step up asset disposals and the resumption of projects, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), told a briefing, adding that individual financial institutions did not have highly concentrated exposure to Evergrande. read more

""In recent years, this company did not operate and manage itself well. It failed to conduct prudent operations according to changing market conditions, and it blindly diversified and expanded its business,"" Zou told the briefing in Beijing.

Chinese officials and state media have been largely silent on the crisis at Evergrande, which has missed a series of bond interest payments and has $300 billion in debt, making it the world's most indebted developer.

Zou also said property firms that have issued bonds overseas should actively fulfil their debt repayment obligations.

Evergrande has left its offshore investors in the dark about repayment plans after already missing three rounds of interest payments on its dollar bonds.

Zou's comments came as sources told Reuters that Evergrande (3333.HK) CEO Xia Haijun was holding talks in Hong Kong with investment banks and creditors over a possible restructuring and asset sales. read more

Xia had been in Hong Kong for more than two months, several sources told Reuters. Xia needed to communicate with foreign banks on loan extensions and repayments, one of the sources said.

Joining a list of property developers reeling from the debt crisis, China Properties Group Ltd (1838.HK) said on Friday it had defaulted on notes worth $226 million.

Another Chinese developer, Xinyuan Real Estate Co's (XIN.N), avoided a default on a maturing dollar bond on Friday, saying in a Singapore Exchange filing that bondholders had agreed to an offer to accept new bonds and cash in exchange for maturing notes. read more

Xinyuan said that holders of more than 90% of the company's $229 million notes due Oct. 15 had agreed to the exchange, which would see it deliver new bonds worth $205.4 million and $19.1 million cash.

Xinyuan's 14.5% September 2023 bond crashed nearly 30% on Friday to trade at 58.35 cents, according to data provider Duration Finance.

The agreement follows warnings from other developers that they could default on their bonds, while still others have taken steps to delay payments in the wake of Evergrande's troubles.

Evergrande, with 1,300 real estate projects in more than 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week.

However, in a separate statement filed to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Evergrande said it would pay interest coming due on Oct. 19 on a yuan-denominated bond it issued in 2020.

PBOC URGES SPEEDY ASSET SALES

At the Friday briefing, Zou said Evergrande should step up asset disposals and the resumption of project building, for which authorities will provide financing support.

Some lenders have had “misunderstandings"" about the central bank’s debt control policies, causing financial strains for some developers, as some new projects were unable to get loans even after repaying existing loans, Zou said.

""This short-term extreme reaction is a normal market phenomenon,” he said.

Chinese developers face more than $500 million in coupon payments on their high-yield bonds before the end of this month. Refinitiv data show coupon payments by Kaisa Group Holdings (1638.HK) and Fantasia Holdings (1777.HK) are due this weekend. read more

""In some cities, the property prices surged too fast, causing the approval and issuance of personal mortgages to be restrained,"" Zou said, referring to the first nine months of this year.

""Once housing prices stabilise, the supply and demand of mortgages in those cities will be normalized too,"" he said.

FRESH SETBACKS

Still, Evergrande suffered fresh setbacks on Friday with sources telling Reuters that Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy the company's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation. read more

Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some assets to repay creditors knocking on its doors and the collapse of the talks shows the difficulties it is facing.

Adding to its woes, Hong Kong's audit regulator said on Friday it was investigating Evergrande's 2020 accounts and their audit by PwC because it had concerns about the adequacy of reporting on whether it could continue operating as a going concern. read more

Evergrande bonds fell following the Reuters report. The company's 8.75% June 2025 bonds slumped more than 6% to trade at a discount of more than 80% from its face value, according to data provider Duration Finance.

BOND SLUMP DEEPENS

Apart from Xinyuan, Duration Finance data showed other developers' bonds deepening their rout. Sinic Holdings Group's 10.5% June 2022 bond dived more than 20% to just 12.25 cents, and Ronshine China Holdings' February 2022 bond fell more than 6% to 68.35 cents.

Moody's downgraded Risesun Real Estate Development Co Ltd (002146.SZ) to B1/B2, with a negative outlook.

Spreads on Chinese high-yield corporate dollar bonds (.MERACYC) touched a fresh record late Thursday evening U.S. time, having nearly tripled since late May, while investment-grade spreads remained near their widest in more than two months (.MERACCG).

Worries of contagion have also hit property developers' shares this week. On Friday, an index tracking A-shares in the sector (.CSI000952) gave up small gains to end down 0.1%, lagging a 0.38% gain in the blue-chip index (.CSI300) and taking losses since Tuesday to 4.5%.

China has been ramping up property market curbs since late 2020, introducing new measures to closely monitor and control developers' debt levels.

But with economic growth cooling and new construction starts slowing, speculation has been rife over whether it will start relaxing those restrictions, as was the case during previous downturns.

US futures edged higher on Tuesday after the benchmark indices climbed the previous day.

A strong earnings season so far has offset fears about inflation, central banks, and Evergrande.

The crypto world was excited as the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund was due to launch.

US futures edged upwards on Monday as investors weighed strong company earnings against worries about rising inflation and distressed Chinese property developer Evergrande.

S&P 500 futures were up 0.26% after the index rose 0.34% the previous day. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.25% higher while Dow Jones futures rose 0.19%.

European stocks also made small gains, with the Stoxx 600 up only slightly. China's CSI 300 rose 0.98% overnight, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.65%.

Stocks have been volatile for the past two months as investors have fretted about strong price rises, the likelihood of less central bank stimulus, and fears of contagion from the looming default of China's Evergrande.

But equities have been supported by a strong third-quarter earnings season so far, with US banks in particular posting solid results.

Data company FactSet said companies' profit margins remained strong in the third quarter and were on track to come in at their third-highest level since 2008.

""More S&P 500 companies are beating [earnings per share] estimates for the third quarter than average, and beating EPS estimates by a wider margin than average,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.

Earnings season continues on Tuesday, with Netflix and Johnson & Johnson set to report their latest figures.

However, investors remain jittery about inflation and its likely effect on central bank policy. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey gave a strong signal over the weekend that the BoE is likely to raise interest rates soon to deal with strong price rises, making it the first major central bank to do so.

Another major worry is the crisis at China's Evergrande, a stressed property developer that owes more than $300 billion. It met a Hong Kong coupon payment on Tuesday, but has missed a number of other recent installments on offshore bonds.

Barclays and UBS downgraded their 2021 growth forecasts for China on Monday, saying the Evergrande crisis was spreading to the broader property market and weighing on investment.

Despite concerns about inflation, the yield on the key 10-year US Treasury note has stayed steady in recent days. It was roughly flat on Tuesday at 1.584%, down from above 1.62% on Monday.

Yet the prospect of higher interest rates has lifted shorter maturity bond yields sharply. The yield on the 3-year Treasury note stood at 0.701% on Tuesday, down slightly from Monday but trading at around its highest since the start of the pandemic.

Elsewhere in markets, oil prices rose again as the global energy crunch pushed users back towards the fossil fuel. Brent crude was up 0.69% to $84.92, its highest level since January 2018. WTI crude was up 0.99% to $82.52 a barrel, its highest since January 2014.

Bitcoin was flat at around $62,100 after rising sharply in recent days in anticipation of the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund, which is due to launch on Tuesday.

""The cryptoverse is about to get a whole lot bigger now that the first US bitcoin-linked ETF will launch on Tuesday,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

China Evergrande paid bondholders interest on a dollar bond due Friday.

It's the real estate giant's second narrow pull away from the brink of default in about a week.

Chinese authorities have publicly chided Evergrande and have reportedly told its founder to use his money to pay company debt.

China Evergrande has managed to avoid a default again - making bond interest payments just before a deadline today, reported the New York Times and Bloomberg, citing bondholders who have been paid.

The real estate behemoth faces a $300 billion debt pile, with $500 million in payments due by the end of this year.

The company owed $45.2 million in bond interest, which was initially due on September 29. Evergrande missed the deadline but had a 30-day grace period before it would be considered a default. It is unclear if the company paid off the total interest amount today.

Evergrande did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

This latest payment comes a week after the company made an $83.5 million bond coupon payment last Friday that was also paid just before a grace period deadline.

Investors worldwide have been roiled by Evergrande's debt woes, fearing contagion across the global economy should the company default. But Chinese officials have sought to calm nerves about the debt crisis, saying the problems would not spiral out of control.

Chinese authorities have publicly chided Evergrande, telling it to resolve its debt problems and instructing the country's real estate developers to pay their overseas bondholders.

Chinese property company faces more imminent debt deadlines

Next 30-day payment grace period expires on Oct. 29

Global financial markets on tenterhooks

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday, buying it another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.

The property developer also announced plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Facing a deadline on Saturday to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, Evergande sent $83.5 million to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, the person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

That brought relief for investors and regulators worried about fallout for global markets and added to reassurances from Chinese officials that creditors would be protected. read more

Still, the world's most indebted property firm - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - needs to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default on Oct. 29.

With little known about its ability to pay and property sales tumbling 30% in the last 12 months, there is deep scepticism over Evergrande's capacity to ride out the crisis.

The company, once China's top-selling property developer, did not respond to a request for comment on debt payment.

Citibank declined to comment.

Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said on Friday the company would aim to make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business instead of property within 10 years.

Property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year by that time, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, he was quoted as saying by the state-backed Securities Times.

Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.

'BIT OF A RELIEF'

Evergrande's overall woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value. read more

Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.

It was not clear how cash-strapped Evergrande was able to raise funds to pay the bondholders or whether any had already received the money. Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Oct. 29 and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December. read more

""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.

""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next."" read more

If it fails to make next week's payment, or any other final deadlines in coming weeks, defaults would be triggered on all $19 billion of its bonds in international capital markets.

That would be the second biggest emerging market corporate default after Venezuela's state-owned oil firm.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each. read more

DISTRESSED LEVELS

Evergrande's dollar bond prices surged on Friday morning after news of the transfer, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of less than a quarter of face value.

Those gains evaporated on Friday afternoon in Asia, however, pushing several of the company's other bonds down more than 6%.

Evergrande's shares rose as much as 7.8% before closing up 4.3%, but still finished a shortened week down 8.8%.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds. read more

Chinese property companies could now be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year. read more

Still, Friday's news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index (.HSMPI) rise 3.3%.

In mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index finished up 2.4%, and an index tracking the broader property sector (.CSI000006) added 2%.

Asked whether it would step in to help its rival ease its liquidity crisis, the chairman of China's third-biggest developer, China Vanke Co Ltd (000002.SZ), said developers needed to ensure their own safety first.

""Everyone feels the chill as 'winter' arrives for the sector,"" Chairman Yu Liang told a company forum.

Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.

A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,"" said Quiddity's Lundy.

NewsApi.org,"Summary Evergrande looks set to miss third round of bond payments

Some offshore bondholders have not had payment - sources

Modern Land asks investors to push back bond payment

Sinic warns it is likely to default next week

SHANGHAI/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chinese property firms' bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande (3333.HK) looked set to miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.

High-yield Chinese bond markets were routed once again as fears about fast-spreading contagion in the $5 trillion sector, which drives a sizable chunk of the Chinese economy, continued to savage sentiment.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping is launching inspections of financial institutions to see if private firms like Evergrande had been too close to state-owned banks, investment firms and financial regulators. Large lenders to Evergrande included financial conglomerate Citic, which is being scrutinized, the WSJ reported. Citic was not immediately available for comment. read more

Weary investors had been holding out little hope that Evergrande would suddenly stump up Monday's near $150 million of coupon payments, but the fact bondholders said they hadn't received anything this time either just bolstered expectations for a full-scale default.

""The key for offshore holders is the next couple of weeks and whether any payment or communication will come from the company in relation to its first missed offshore coupon,"" wrote Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA, at forex trading firm OANDA in a research note on Monday.

Erlam wrote that it was ""highly unlikely"" Evergrande would make the payment ""considering how the last two deadlines have gone"".

A spokesperson for Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment

Once China's largest developer, the firm has more than $300 billion in liabilities that are now at risk. read more

The cash-strapped property developer's troubles and contagion worries have sent shockwaves across global markets and the firm has already missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

CST Group Limited, an investment holding company, said in a statement on Monday that it sold 10.5% China Evergrande Notes and 11.5% China Evergrande Notes for $815,000 and $702,000.

Other signs of stress included smaller developer Modern Land (1107.HK) asking investors to push back by three months a $250 million bond payment due on Oct. 25 in part ""to avoid any potential payment default.""

Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) said it too was likely default next week as it didn't have enough financial resources to make its remaining bond payments this year. It has one at the start of next week, although that bond was already down 75%.

Modern Land's April 2023 bond with a coupon of 9.8% plunged more than 25% to 32.25 cents on the day, according to financial data provider Duration Finance, while the company's shares (1107.HK) have lost a third of their value over the last month.

Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, also saw some of its bonds slump to well under half their face value , . R&F Properties (2777.HK), and Greenland Holdings, which both have prestige projects in global cities like London, New York and Sydney, were also widely sold.

""It's a disastrous day,"" said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, highlighting how even some supposedly safer ""investment grade"" firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds.

An exterior view of the headquarters of China Evergrande Group in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, September 29, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song

""We think it's driven by global fund outflow .... Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.

Analysts at JPMorgan also highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold 'junk'-rated Chinese debt.

There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank's closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as ""onshore"" bonds.

""Evergrande's contagion risk is now spreading across other issuers and sectors,"" JPMorgan's analysts said.

Another London based analyst who asked not to be named said: ""Slowly and gradually we are seeing the rest of the Chinese property sector fall apart"".

Fantasia Group China Co, whose controlling shareholder is Fantasia Holdings, said on Monday it would adjust the trading mechanism of its Shanghai-traded bonds following credit downgrades by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI).

Fantasia (1777.HK) had appointed advisers on Friday after it shocked markets by missing a bond payment earlier in the week. It saw its bonds dive from almost 100 cents on the dollar to just 20 cents, as just a couple of weeks earlier it had said its liquidity was fine.

""We believe policymakers have zero tolerance for systemic risk to emerge and are aiming to maintain a stable property market, and policy support could be forthcoming if the deterioration in property activity levels worsen,"" said Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs.

""That said, we also believe that policymakers do not want to over-stimulate, and their longer term goal is to deleverage the property sector.""

Summary Xia discussing loan extensions, repayments, source says

Offshore investors still in dark about repayment plans

Investors fret about impact of possible collapse

Chinese central bank officials says issue controllable

HONG KONG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) chief executive is holding talks in Hong Kong with investment banks and creditors over a possible restructuring and asset sales, two people said, as the Chinese developer battles against default on more than $300 billion in debts.

CEO Xia Haijun, a confidant of chairman Hui Ka Yan and who runs Evergrande's day-to-day operations including financing, has been in Hong Kong, where the property firm has a major presence, for more than two months, the two sources told Reuters.

A third source said Xia was talking to banks and creditors in Hong Kong, but did not say what was being discussed.

Shenzhen-headquartered Evergrande, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, has left its offshore investors in the dark about repayment plans after already missing three rounds of interest payments on its dollar bonds.

Xia's talks with investment banks and creditors in Hong Kong has not previously been reported.

One of the sources said Xia needed to communicate with foreign banks on loan extensions and repayments. The source declined to disclose the identity of the creditors that Xia had spoken to in recent days.

""Xia also needs to sort out how many off-balance sheet debts the group has offshore, because many were underwritten at subsidiary levels and he himself may not be even aware of (that),"" he said. ""Before that they cannot work on restructuring and talk to bondholders.""

Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some of its assets to raise cash - efforts that have not yet yielded much success - as concerns have grown in recent weeks about a possible collapse and the impact on global markets and China's economy.

Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation, Reuters reported on Friday. read more

A Chinese central bank official said on Friday the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system was controllable and the risk exposures of individual financial institutions were not big. read more

Evergrande and Xia did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The sources, who have direct knowledge of the development, declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

PUBLIC APPEARANCE

Evergrande Chairman Hui has not appeared in public in recent weeks or announced plans to address the group's woes, leaving investors wondering if they would have to book losses when the 30-day grace periods end this month for unpaid bond coupons.

Last month, the developer issued a statement saying Hui had urged company executives to ensure the quality delivery of properties and redemption of wealth management products.

Xia, who is also vice president of the board, joined the company in 2007 and is responsible for Evergrande's capital operation and management, as well as legal affairs and overseas affairs, according to the company's website.

He has been in Hong Kong since July, according to one of the sources. The second source said Xia had been meeting Chinese investment banks in the city to explore possible asset sales.

Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, has said that it is looking to dispose of stakes in assets including its services and electric vehicle units to raise funds.

The developer is finalising details to sell 51% of its Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK) unit to Hopson Development (0754.HK) for HK$20 billion ($2.57 billion). read more

Investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds, demanded last week more information and transparency from Evergrande.

The developer said last month it had appointed Houlihan Lokey and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers to examine its financial options, as it warned of default risks amid plunging property sales. read more

Chinese central bank officials says issue controllable

HONG KONG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Evergrande Group's (3333.HK) chief executive is holding talks in Hong Kong with investment banks and creditors over a possible restructuring and asset sales, two people said, as the Chinese developer battles against default on more than $300 billion in debts.

CEO Xia Haijun, a confidant of chairman Hui Ka Yan and who runs Evergrande's day-to-day operations including financing, has been in Hong Kong, where the property firm has a major presence, for more than two months, the two sources told Reuters.

A third source said Xia was talking to banks and creditors in Hong Kong, but did not say what was being discussed.

Shenzhen-headquartered Evergrande, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, has left its offshore investors in the dark about repayment plans after already missing three rounds of interest payments on its dollar bonds.

Xia's talks with investment banks and creditors in Hong Kong has not previously been reported.

One of the sources said Xia needed to communicate with foreign banks on loan extensions and repayments. The source declined to disclose the identity of the creditors that Xia had spoken to in recent days.

""Xia also needs to sort out how many off-balance sheet debts the group has offshore, because many were underwritten at subsidiary levels and he himself may not be even aware of (that),"" he said. ""Before that they cannot work on restructuring and talk to bondholders.""

Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some of its assets to raise cash - efforts that have not yet yielded much success - as concerns have grown in recent weeks about a possible collapse and the impact on global markets and China's economy.

Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation, Reuters reported on Friday. read more

A Chinese central bank official said on Friday the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system was controllable and the risk exposures of individual financial institutions were not big. read more

Evergrande and Xia did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The sources, who have direct knowledge of the development, declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

PUBLIC APPEARANCE

Evergrande Chairman Hui has not appeared in public in recent weeks or announced plans to address the group's woes, leaving investors wondering if they would have to book losses when the 30-day grace periods end this month for unpaid bond coupons.

Last month, the developer issued a statement saying Hui had urged company executives to ensure the quality delivery of properties and redemption of wealth management products.

Xia, who is also vice president of the board, joined the company in 2007 and is responsible for Evergrande's capital operation and management, as well as legal affairs and overseas affairs, according to the company's website.

He has been in Hong Kong since July, according to one of the sources. The second source said Xia had been meeting Chinese investment banks in the city to explore possible asset sales.

Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, has said that it is looking to dispose of stakes in assets including its services and electric vehicle units to raise funds.

The developer is finalising details to sell 51% of its Evergrande Property Services (6666.HK) unit to Hopson Development (0754.HK) for HK$20 billion ($2.57 billion). read more

Investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds, demanded last week more information and transparency from Evergrande.

The developer said last month it had appointed Houlihan Lokey and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers to examine its financial options, as it warned of default risks amid plunging property sales. read more

Summary Deal to sell 51% in property services unit put on hold -sources

Evergrande paid onshore bond coupon due Tue - sources

Sunac made $27.14 mln offshore coupon payment -source

SHANGHAI/LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China's property sector saw more drama on Tuesday as Evergrande (3333.HK) shelved plans to sell a majority stake in its property services unit, Sinic formally declared default and Kaisa was crunched by another credit rating cut.

Sources told Reuters that Evergrande, teetering on the brink of collapse with more than $300 billion in debt, had been forced to stall its proposed $2.6 billion, 51% stake sale (6666.HK) to smaller rival Hopson Development (0754.HK) after failing to win the blessing of the Guangdong provincial government which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.

When contacted, a Hopson representative asked Reuters to await an announcement. Evergrande and the Guangdong provincial government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, amid expectations it is about to formally default on one of international bonds.

Hengda Real Estate Group Co, Evergrande's flagship unit, has though transferred funds to pay an 'onshore' bond coupon of 121.8 million yuan ($19 million), sources with knowledge of the matter said.

One said Evergrande, China's No. 2 developer, needs to prioritise its limited funds towards the domestic market where the stakes are much higher for the country's financial system.

While, it was not immediately clear why the Guangdong provincial government has not approved the Evergrande Property Services transaction, some of Evergrande's international creditors had also opposed the deal, the person added.

Another source said the announcement of the deal will be delayed, pending China's regulatory approval. The deal has already won Hong Kong Stock Exchange's special approval, he added.

Reuters reported last week Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property (0123.HK) had pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation.

A source said the company had also received guidance from the municipal government of the southern city of Guangzhou to put the purchase on hold at the end of August. read more

MARKETS ROILED

The liquidity crisis at Evergrande has roiled global markets. High-yield bonds issued by Chinese property developers have been hit especially hard although there have been some signs that markets are beginning to differentiate.

An Evergrande bond due March 23, 2022 will officially be in default if the company does not make good after a 30-day grace period for a missed coupon payment that had been due on Sept. 23.

But the wider offshore bond market has responded positively after assuring comments from China central bank's and coupon payments by two other major developers.

An index of China high-yield debt (.MERACYC), which is dominated by property developer issuers, has seen spreads tighten from last week's record levels to around 1,484 points on Tuesday.

Sunac China (1918.HK), which has a $27.14 million payment due Tuesday, has paid its bondholders, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. A Sunac representative also declined to comment.

Kaisa Group (1638.HK), which was the first Chinese firm to default back in 2015 said on Monday it had paid a coupon due Oct. 16 and it plans to transfer funds for a coupon worth $35.85 million due Oct. 22 on Thursday. read more

Its bonds slumped as much as 13 cents on the dollar, or nearly 25%, on Tuesday, after Moody's slashed the firm's credit rating and immediately warned it could be cut again due to default worries.

In the past few days, the People's Bank of China has said spillover effects on the banking system from Evergrande's debt problems were controllable and that China's economy was ""doing well"".

Bonds from other Chinese developers gained on Tuesday including Modern Land's 2022 bonds which bounced over 8% to 40.250 cents on the dollar, Greenland which jumped 6-7 cents and Central China Real Estate's 2024 bonds which climbed 5% to 44.843 cents.

Smaller developer Sinic Holdings (2103.HK) became the latest to have its rating put in ""selective default"" by S&P after it defaulted on $246 million in bonds, having warned it was likely to do so last week.

SHANGHAI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The spillover effect of Chinese real estate companies' debt default risks to the financial industry is generally controllable, state media said on Monday, as concerns continue to loom over China Evergrande Group.

The comment was published in a Xinhua question and answer piece on the Chinese economy, for which the news agency said it had interviewed ""relevant departments"" and ""authoritative people"".

The article, which did not directly name China Evergrande (3333.HK), said property companies were facing debt default issues due to poor management and a failure to adjust their operations to market changes.

""It should be understood that there will be clues if a property is likely to default on its debts, so the risk of spillover to the financial industry can be predicted,"" Xinhua said.

It also said the country will steadily advance real estate taxation reform.

Evergrande, deep in crisis with more than $300 billion in liabilities, last week appeared to avert default with a last-minute bond coupon payment. On Sunday, it said it had resumed work on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen. read more

Its woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.

Its debt crisis is also being widely watched by global financial markets concerned about broader contagion.

SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Friday, led by property shares, as China Evergrande Group unexpectedly supplied funds for a bond interest payment, while comments from the banking regulator also underpinned the property market.

Evergrande has supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default. Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment.

Energy and mining shares, however, fell as coal futures extended losses after Beijing signalled it would intervene to cool surging prices that contributed to the country’s electricity shortage.

China’s blue-chip CSI300 index closed 0.6% higher, while the Shanghai Composite Index erased earlier gains to end the session 0.3% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.4%.

“In the short term, we believe the interest repayment should provide a fillip to Chinese risk assets, including the yuan and Chinese equities,” said Wei Liang Chang, Macro Strategist at DBS Bank, Singapore.

“Evergrande default risks, though not dissipated, have likely been deferred for some time.”

Sentiment in the sector, which had been badly hurt by Evergrande’s debt crisis, also recovered after China’s banking regulator on Thursday urged lenders to fulfil credit needs for basic demand and support mortgage lending to first-home buyers.

“We note regulators have softened tones to prevent over-tightening on property, and witness marginally easing measures on property-related loans,” Citi said in a research note, expecting the mortgage rate in certain regions to fall over time.

The average mortgage rate in China’s major cities declined in October, the first monthly drop this year, Caixin reported on Friday, citing Beike Research Institute.

HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK), a former major shareholder of embattled developer China Evergrande (3333.HK), jumped as much as 32% on Thursday after it announced an offer to be taken private for HK$1.91 billion ($245 million).

The Hong Kong developer said on Wednesday the family of Chinese Estates' biggest shareholder, Joseph Lau, had proposed to take it private by offering minority shareholders a 38% premium to its last traded price.

The offer represents the latest move by Lau and China Estates to emerge from the shadow of Evergrande, which is floundering due to a huge debt load and threatening the Hong Kong company's future.

Formerly Evergrande's second-biggest shareholder, Chinese Estates has already slashed its holding over the past few months to 4.39% from 6.48%. It has flagged a goal to exit the holding completely and estimates a loss of HK$10.41 billion for the current year from the stake disposal. read more

Eugene Law, business development director of China Galaxy International Financial, said as a listed company Chinese Estates would need to keep updating on its position in Evergrande and ""it does not want that trouble"".

Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Chinese Estates' shares rose to HK$3.81 by noon. They resumed trading on Thursday after being suspended on Sept. 29.

Shares of the Hong Kong developer were down 42% this year before the trading suspension, dragged down by unrealized losses in its investment in Evergrande whose stock took a hit due to liquidity crisis and default risks.

Shares of Chinese Estates/Evergrande

In a statement late on Wednesday, Chinese Estates said its stock price may be further affected by Evergrande, as it is ""cautious and concerned"" about recent developments at the Chinese developer.

A delisting would reduce the costs and management resources to maintain the listing status, Chinese Estates added, and it could provide more flexibility to implement long-term business strategies.

Other than Evergrande, Chinese Estates said it also has significant investments in another Chinese developer, Kaisa Group (1638.HK), whose shares have also suffered falls over the past few months on wider liquidity concerns about China's real estate sector.

Chinese Estates' former chairman Lau has been a major backer of Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan and is a member of the so-called ""poker club"" of Hong Kong tycoons that includes Hui. read more

Lau, whose family owns about 75% of Chinese Estates' equity capital, resigned as its chairman and chief executive in 2014 after he was found guilty of bribery and money laundering charges in the gambling hub of Macau.
