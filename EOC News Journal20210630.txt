Copies of the Annual Report and Notice of Annual General Meeting are available to view at www.renewiplc.com/agm2021 and will be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism at  /nsm/nationalstoragemechanism. Hard copies of these documents have also been posted to those shareholders who have elected to continue to receive paper communications. The Renewi 2021 Sustainability Review has also been published on the website at www.renewiplc.com. Following the publication of the notice of Annual General Meeting, Renewi also announces that its Annual General Meeting will be held at 11am on Thursday 15 July 2021 at its Milton Keynes offices in the UK. However, due to remaining uncertainty concerning any ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, shareholders are strongly encouraged to submit their votes by proxy and to appoint the Chair of the AGM as their proxy. We will continue to review our AGM arrangements in light of the latest Government regulations and guidance, and any changes will be communicated to shareholders before the meeting on www.renewiplc.com. Shareholders are invited to ask questions of the Board. These should be sent to: company.secretaryrenewi.com. When submitting your question, please include your Shareholder Reference Number ('SRN') which can be found on your Form of Proxy or Share Certificate. The Board will also seek to respond to all questions and anticipates publishing questions and responses on the Company's website at: www.renewiplc.com/agm2021. Responses to similar questions will be grouped. Responses to questions received by 5.00 p.m. on Monday 5 July 2021 are expected to be published by no later than 11.00 a.m. on Monday 12 July 2021, which will provide shareholders with the opportunity to read the responses before submitting their proxy votes. Share Consolidation As announced on 27 May 2021, the Board is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM for a consolidation of the Company's share capital on the basis of 1 new ordinary share with a nominal value of GBP1.00 each for every 10 existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each held at the record time (the ""Share Consolidation""). The Share Consolidation is expected to address investor feedback and remove index inclusion restrictions, which together enable a more consistent valuation of the Company. The Share Consolidation will reduce the total number of ordinary shares in issue and is expected to result in a share price and nominal value that the Board believes is more appropriate for a company of the Company's size. As all ordinary shareholdings in the Company will be consolidated, shareholders' percentage holdings in the issued share capital of the Company will (save in respect of fractional entitlements) remain unchanged. As further explained in the Notice of Meeting, fractional entitlements arising from the Share Consolidation will be aggregated and sold in the market. The net proceeds of such sale (after deduction of expenses of the sale) will be distributed in due proportion among the relevant shareholders, except that any individual entitlements of GBP5.00 or less will be retained by the Company and donated to charity. It is intended to split any donation between ""Young Minds"" and ""Wijzijnmind/mindyoung"", both being charities championing the wellbeing and mental health of young people in the UK and the Netherlands respectively. The International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) of the New Ordinary Shares will be GB00BNR4T868.

The reason for the board of directors' new proposal is that the theoretical market value for the warrants issued at the annual general meeting, which was determined using the Black & Scholes valuation model, resulted in a significantly higher valuation than in previous incentive programs and that all participants therefore declined to acquire the warrants. Compared to the program resolved by the annual general meeting, the new program will result in a maximum dilution of approx. 1.5 percent (approx. 1 percent) and a price per option corresponding to the quota value of the underlying share. Except for a slightly revised allocation between participants, the terms are in other regards materially identical to the program resolved by the annual general meeting and incurs only insignificantly higher administrative costs for the Company. The board of directors' full proposal for the new incentive program is set out below.EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING IN OXE MARINE AB (PUBL)The shareholders in the Company are convened to an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held on Monday 28 June 2021.In order to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus, the board of directors has resolved, in accordance with the act (2020:198) on temporary exceptions to facilitate the execution of general meetings in companies and other associations, that the general meeting shall be held without the physical presence of shareholders, proxies or any third parties, and that the shareholders' voting rights may only be exercised in advance by postal voting.Right to attend and noticeShareholders who want to participate at the general meeting must:Story continuesbe recorded as a shareholder in the share register prepared by Euroclear Sweden AB ("" Euroclear "") relating to the circumstances on 17 June 2021; andnotify their intention to attend the general meeting no later than 24 June 2021 by submitting their postal vote in accordance with the instructions set forth under the header ""Postal voting"" below.Nominee-registered sharesShareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee must, in addition to notify their intention to attend the general meeting, re register their shares in their own name so that the shareholder is recorded in the share register on 17 June 2021. Such registration may be temporary (so-called voting right registration) and is requested from the nominee in accordance with the nominee's procedures and in such time in advance as the nominee determines. Voting right registrations duly effected by the nominee no later than 21 June 2021 will be regarded in the preparation of the share register.Postal votingThe shareholders may exercise their voting rights at the general meeting only by postal voting in accordance with sections 20 and 22 of the act (2020:198) on temporary exceptions to facilitate the execution of general meetings in companies and other associations. A special form shall be used for the postal voting, which is available on the Company's website. The postal vote will also constitute the shareholder's notification of participation. Shareholders may not provide the postal vote with any special instructions or conditions. If so, the vote (i.e. the postal vote in its entirety) is invalid. Further instructions and conditions are set forth in the postal voting form.The completed postal voting form must have been received by Advokatfirman Lindahl no later than 24 June 2021. The form shall be sent by e-mail to OXEEGM21lindahl.se or by post to Advokatfirman Lindahl KB, att. Maximilian Hansson Wallenberg, Box 11911, 404 39 Göteborg. Shareholders who are legal entities shall enclose a certificate of registration or equivalent authorization document to the postal voting form.A shareholder may request that one or several matters in the proposed agenda is resolved to be postponed until a continued general meeting, which may not be held solely by postal voting. Such a continued general meeting shall be convened should the general meeting so adopt or if shareholders representing of not less than one-tenth of all shares in the Company so request.ProxyShareholders who wish to be represented by a proxy must submit a dated proxy form. If the proxy is executed by a legal person, a copy of the certificate of registration or equivalent authorization document must be enclosed. The proxy form may not be valid for a period longer than five years from its issuance. The original proxy form and certificate of registration shall be enclosed to the postal voting form. The Company provides a form of proxy at request and it is also available at the Company's website, www.oxemarine.com.Proposed agendaOpening of the general meeting and election of chairman of the general meeting Preparation and approval of the voting list Election of one or several persons to verify the minutes of the meeting Determination of whether the meeting has been duly convened Approval of the agenda Resolution to implement a long-term incentive program Close of the general meetingThe Board of Directors' proposalsItem 1 – Election of chairman of the general meetingThe board of directors proposes that attorney-at-law Mikael Mellberg is elected as chairman of the general meeting.Item 2 – Preparation and approval of the voting listThe board of directors proposes that the voting list that shall be approved is the voting list prepared by Advokatfirman Lindahl on behalf of the Company, based on the Company's share register for the general meeting and received postal votes.Item 3 - Election of one or several persons to verify the minutes of the meetingThe board of directors proposes that Arne Andersson is elected to verify the minutes of the general meeting.Item 5 – Approval of the agendaThe board of directors proposes that the agenda set forth under the header ""Proposed agenda"" shall be approved as the agenda of the general meeting.Item 6 – Resolution to implement a long-term incentive programThe annual general meeting of 2021 resolved to implement a long-term incentive program for senior executives by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants to the participants of the incentive program. Since the annual general meeting, all issued warrants have been subscribed for by the Company. Due to the theoretical market value at the time of the intended transfer of the warrants to the participants, which was determined by the use of the Black & Scholes valuation model, resulting in a valuation higher than the valuations of previous incentive warrants in the Company, the participants have chosen not to acquire the warrants and thereby to not participate in the incentive program resolved by the annual general meeting.The board of directors therefore proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement a new long-term incentive program for senior executives comprising of qualified employee stock options on the terms and conditions set out below. The qualified employee stock options shall entitle to subscription of new shares in the Company.To secure the Company's obligations under the new incentive program, the board of directors proposes that the general meeting also resolves on (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants on the terms and conditions set forth below.Background and reasons for the proposalThe reason for the proposal is to reward valuable senior executives and to promote a long term shared interest between senior executives and the Company's shareholders. These objectives are assessed to be in line with all shareholders' interests.The incentive program encompasses senior executives in the Company (the ""Participants"").The Company's existing incentive programsThe Company has previously issued warrants of series 2019:2 to the Company's employees and consultants. According to the terms at the time of issue, those warrants entitle to subscribe for a total of 10,000,000 new shares in the Company, corresponding to a total dilution of approx. 5 percent before utilization of any warrants of series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039 (warrants held by the European Investment Bank) and approx. 4.3 percent assuming full utilization of the warrants of series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039. The warrants of series 2019:2 entitle to subscription for new shares during the period between 1–31 December 2022.The Company has also issued warrants of series 2021/2025 in accordance with the annual general meeting's resolution on 16 April 2021. According to the terms at the time of issue, those warrants entitle to subscribe for a total of 2,100,000 new shares in the Company, corresponding to a total dilution of approx. 1 percent before utilization of any warrants of series 2019:2, series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039 and approx. 0.9 percent assuming full utilization of the warrants of series 2019:2, series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039. The warrants of series 2021/2025 may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the following subscription periods: (i) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the first quarter of 2025, (ii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the second quarter of 2025, and (iii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2025.The warrants of series 2021/2025 have not been transferred to the participants of the incentive program due to the reasons set forth above. Instead, the warrants of series 2021/2025 shall be used as security for the Company's obligations under the now proposed incentive program.Other than the incentive programs described above, there are no equity related incentive programs outstanding in the Company.A. Qualified employee stock optionsThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement an incentive program in accordance with the rules for qualified employee stock options on the following material terms and conditions.The employee stock option program shall comprise of no more than 3,050,000 employee stock options which at full utilization may result in a total dilution of approx. 1.5 percent (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with the terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the options). The employee stock options shall be allotted to the Participants at a premium corresponding to the quotient value of the previous shares. Each employee stock option shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 6 per share. The employee stock options may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the following subscription periods: (i) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the first quarter of 2025, (ii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the second quarter of 2025, and (iii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2025.

The entitlement to participate in the employee stock option program is conditioned upon the Participant entering into a qualified employee stock option agreement with the Company. The agreement shall, inter alia, include the following terms and conditions:The employee stock options may be exercised for subscription of shares at the earliest in accordance with Section 4 above (i.e. later than three years after the Participant signed the qualified employee stock option agreement).The employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the holder.The employee stock options are conditioned upon the Participant's continued employment in the Company and require that the Participant's working hours for a period of three years from the allotment of the employee stock options amount to an average of at least 30 hours per week. If the employment in the Company is terminated before the employee stock options have been exercised for subscription of shares, all of the Participant's unexercised employee stock options shall lapse.If, during the term of the employee stock options, the general meeting resolves to, inter alia , increase or decrease the number of outstanding shares, the employee stock options might have to be recalculated in order to maintain the value of the options. Resolutions on recalculation shall be made by the board of directors of the Company.The board of directors or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make any minor adjustments required to fulfil the purpose of the program.7. The participation in the employee stock option program requires that the participation is legally possible and that the participation, in the board of directors' opinion, can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts.8. The board of directors shall be responsible for the design and management of the employee stock option program within these material terms and conditions.B. Directed issue of warrantsI. Terms and conditions for directed issue of warrants to secure the Company's obligations under the incentive programIn order to secure the Company's delivery of shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the qualified employee stock options as set out in Section A above, it is proposed that the general meeting resolves to issue warrants on the following terms and conditions.The Company shall issue no more than 950,000 warrants.

Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of shares no later than three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2025 shall lapse. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 6 per share (the ""Exercise Price""). The Exercise Price is three times the subscription price for new shares in the Company's latest issue of shares, in which the subscription period ended on 2 October 2020.

It generated the best French fine art auction result since the sale in October 2019 of Cimabue's Christ Mocked. Sotheby's and Mirabaud-Mercier chose Paris to sell this very French canvas of a Parisian street scene that had been kept in a French collection for over a century.France remains one of the primary sources of important art works, as we have again seen with the rediscovery of a superb painting by Jean-Honoré Fragonard – Un philosophe lisant – that will be offered for sale on 26 June 2021 in the French town of Epernay. Maître Antoine Petit and Enchères Champagne have set the estimated price range at $1.8 million - $2.4 million. Nevertheless... so far, the Parisian marketplace for fine art is still not yet markedly benefiting from Brexit.Annual Fine Art auction turnover (1 January 2000 - 10 June 2021)Annual Fine Art auction turnover (1 January 2000 - 10 June 2021)Vincent Van Gogh, Scène de rue à Montmartre (1887): $15.4 million on 25 March 2021 at Sotheby's & Mirabaud-MercierVincent Van Gogh, Scène de rue à Montmartre (1887): $15.4 million on 25 March 2021 at Sotheby’s & Mirabaud-MercierAccording to thierry Ehrmann, President and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""Paris is not really attracting masterpieces from abroad more than before, as London did for many years, and, as it continues to do. Despite Brexit, the English capital is still attracting major works that could have been sold in France: for example, on 23 March 2021, Christie's sold, three key works from the Paris collection of Claude Hersaint (signed Miro, Magritte and Ernst) in London for a total of $31 million.""To date, Brexit therefore does not appear to have benefited France.Sotheby's and Christie's are still France's leading fine art auction houses with market shares of 34% and 17% respectivelyIn 2021 it looks like the Anglo-Saxon giants are still reigning over the French fine art auction market. Sotheby's is currently twice as productive as its rival, but Christie's will be closing out the first semester of the year with a prestige sale of 20th / 21st Century Art (30 June 2021). In market share terms, France's national auction operators are still substantially behind; Artcurial with 5% and Cornette de Saint-Cyr with just 3% are struggling to compete.Story continuesThat said, the Anglo-Saxon auction houses in Paris do not have a monopoly on the high-end market. Cornette de Saint Cyr generated France's second best result of H1 2021 when it hammered $7 million for Wu Guanzhong's painting Hong Kong Night (1987). As regards Zao-Wou-ki, two works are among the Top-5 results of the year (in France). Unfortunately, many of his works are subsequently taken to Asia.Three works by Chinese artists in the Top 5 French auction results so far in 20211.

The reason for the board of directors' new proposal is that the theoretical market value for the warrants issued at the annual general meeting, which was determined using the Black & Scholes valuation model, resulted in a significantly higher valuation than in previous incentive programs and that all participants therefore declined to acquire the warrants. Compared to the program resolved by the annual general meeting, the new program will result in a maximum dilution of approx. 1.5 percent (approx. 1 percent) and a price per option corresponding to the quota value of the underlying share. Except for a slightly revised allocation between participants, the terms are in other regards materially identical to the program resolved by the annual general meeting and incurs only insignificantly higher administrative costs for the Company.

Since the annual general meeting, all issued warrants have been subscribed for by the Company. Due to the theoretical market value at the time of the intended transfer of the warrants to the participants, which was determined by the use of the Black & Scholes valuation model, resulting in a valuation higher than the valuations of previous incentive warrants in the Company, the participants have chosen not to acquire the warrants and thereby to not participate in the incentive program resolved by the annual general meeting.The board of directors therefore proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement a new long-term incentive program for senior executives comprising of qualified employee stock options on the terms and conditions set out below. The qualified employee stock options shall entitle to subscription of new shares in the Company.To secure the Company's obligations under the new incentive program, the board of directors proposes that the general meeting also resolves on (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants on the terms and conditions set forth below.Background and reasons for the proposalThe reason for the proposal is to reward valuable senior executives and to promote a long term shared interest between senior executives and the Company's shareholders. These objectives are assessed to be in line with all shareholders' interests.The incentive program encompasses senior executives in the Company (the ""Participants"").The Company's existing incentive programsThe Company has previously issued warrants of series 2019:2 to the Company's employees and consultants. According to the terms at the time of issue, those warrants entitle to subscribe for a total of 10,000,000 new shares in the Company, corresponding to a total dilution of approx. 5 percent before utilization of any warrants of series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039 (warrants held by the European Investment Bank) and approx. 4.3 percent assuming full utilization of the warrants of series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039. The warrants of series 2019:2 entitle to subscription for new shares during the period between 1–31 December 2022.The Company has also issued warrants of series 2021/2025 in accordance with the annual general meeting's resolution on 16 April 2021. According to the terms at the time of issue, those warrants entitle to subscribe for a total of 2,100,000 new shares in the Company, corresponding to a total dilution of approx. 1 percent before utilization of any warrants of series 2019:2, series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039 and approx. 0.9 percent assuming full utilization of the warrants of series 2019:2, series 2019/2039 and series 2020/2039. The warrants of series 2021/2025 may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the following subscription periods: (i) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the first quarter of 2025, (ii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the second quarter of 2025, and (iii) three weeks after the date of publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2025.The warrants of series 2021/2025 have not been transferred to the participants of the incentive program due to the reasons set forth above. Instead, the warrants of series 2021/2025 shall be used as security for the Company's obligations under the now proposed incentive program.Other than the incentive programs described above, there are no equity related incentive programs outstanding in the Company.A. Qualified employee stock optionsThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement an incentive program in accordance with the rules for qualified employee stock options on the following material terms and conditions.The employee stock option program shall comprise of no more than 3,050,000 employee stock options which at full utilization may result in a total dilution of approx. 1.5 percent (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with the terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the options).

If the employment in the Company is terminated before the employee stock options have been exercised for subscription of shares, all of the Participant's unexercised employee stock options shall lapse.If, during the term of the employee stock options, the general meeting resolves to, inter alia , increase or decrease the number of outstanding shares, the employee stock options might have to be recalculated in order to maintain the value of the options.

What's the explanation for sticking with subscale inhouse third-party funds custody operations when the economic logic for outsourcing is so clear?Platforum, a UK research firm analysing trends in investment distribution, in association with Clearstream performed a study on third-party funds custody and related back-office functions to provide answers to this question.For the whitepaper 'Meeting third-party custody needs of UK platforms and wealth managers', Platforum interviewed a wide range of platforms, wealth managers and technology providers in Q1 & Q2 2021 to establish business models used and their comparative merits.Handling third-party funds custody inhouse can lead to all kinds of challenges for businesses - especially from a regulatory (CASS - UK Client Asset Sourcebook rules) point of view.Custody requires huge scale and administrative focus, relying on economies of scale for processing, security and efficiencies, which smaller organisations can hardly achieve. UK platforms and wealth managers vary in their approach to third-party fund custody. Some do it all in-house, some outsource entirely and others take a hybrid approach.The whitepaper shows why the senior managers of wealth management and platform organisations need to clearly review their current third-party custody arrangements to see if they can cut costs and increase security.New capabilities for outsourcing have fundamentally changed the opportunity for finding efficiencies and increase security.Outsourcing to trusted specialists, such as Clearstream's Vestima suite of fund execution services with the scale and expertise to do the job safely and compliantly is in many cases not just safer, but also less costly.",neutral,0.48,0.5,0.02,mixed,0.51,0.07,0.42,True,English,,"['thirdparty', 'platforms', 'wealth', 'meeting', 'inhouse', 'uk', 'managers', 'whitepaper', 'outsourcing', 'needs', 'funds', 'custody', 'scale']",2021-06-15,marketscreener.com,Euroclear

LuxSE built an API that allows documents created on Origin to be shared with the exchange so that the issuer doesn’t need to do anything except select the exchange as its listing option on the platform.The first fully digital bond to be issued on the platform had come in June 2019 when Citi privately placed a A$30m green bond for Swedish social housing firm Vasakronan. That was followed in October 2019 with the first fully digital certificate of deposit, a HK$100m issue from China Construction Bank placed by Crédit Agricole CIB.But the big breakthrough came last year, when Crédit Agricole issued the first benchmark bond using the platform, a €1bn social bond. The documentation was automatically and digitally drafted, including the term sheet, final terms, subscription agreement, and signing and closing agenda.“The group working on a syndicated transaction is larger within an institution. And so, each time we’ve done one, it creates more buzz within the market simply because there are more people users logged into the platform interacting on the deal to make it happen,” he says.Palaniappan says that’s Origin’s biggest achievement over the last year — although as a founder he can’t help but be proud of completing the company’s $7m Series A funding round which was supported by Clearstream and Luxembourg Stock Exchange.“That was the culmination of probably two years’ discussions and negotiations and it is fantastic validation,” he says. “In the start-up world, funding milestones get a lot of airtime but I think that they should always be viewed as a facilitator, not as the destination. Client traction should be the destination, so for us the first public digital syndicated bond was really important.”The firm now counts more than 90 issuers and 20 dealers as clients. Given the plethora of competing tech platforms that have sprung up over the last couple of years, that client list is helping put it in pole position in the race for critical massThe traction it has got also shows that it has closed what Palaniappan calls the “massive gap” between the identification of a problem and the successful conceptualisation, build, deployment, and adoption of a solution. “When we started out six years ago, we were almost the only ones out there and essentially had to convince the market there was a problem that technology could fix. Now, customers complain of platform fatigue but we’re confident — because we’ve been through the journey — that we can deliver what we promise.”",positive,1.0,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.05,0.55,True,English,,"['platform', 'operations', 'digital', 'markets', 'market', 'funding', 'origin', 'bond', 'trade', 'ssa', 'thats', 'syndicated', 'primary', 'issuers', 'best', 'exchange', 'fintech']",2021-06-13,globalcapital.com,Euroclear

Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Subordinated Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Subordinated Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.U.K. MiFIR product governance - Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Subordinated Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Subordinated Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“U.K. MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Subordinated Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Subordinated Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Subordinated Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.EU PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors – The Subordinated Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Subordinated Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Subordinated Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.U.K. PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to U.K. retail investors - The Subordinated Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).

A reference to the “relevant U.K. resolution authority” is to any authority with the ability to exercise a U.K. bail-in power). According to the principles contained in the Banking Act, we expect that the relevant U.K. resolution authority would exercise its U.K. bail-in power in respect of the Subordinated Notes having regard to the hierarchy of creditor claims and that the holder or beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes would be treated equally in respect of the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power with all other claims that would rank pari passu with the Subordinated Notes upon an insolvency of LBG. No repayment of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes or payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes shall become due and payable after the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority unless, at the time that such repayment or payment, respectively, is scheduled to become due, such repayment or payment would be permitted to be made by us under the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom applicable to us or other members of the Group. LBG’s obligations to indemnify the Trustee in accordance with the Section 6.07 of the Subordinated Indenture shall survive the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Subordinated Notes. By its acquisition of the Subordinated Notes, each holder and each beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), waives any and all claims against the Trustee for, agrees not to initiate a suit against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee shall not be liable for, any action that the Trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Subordinated Notes. By its acquisition of the Subordinated Notes, each holder and each beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes acknowledges and agrees that:S- 3(i) the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Subordinated Notes shall not give rise to a default for purposes of Section 315(b) (Notice of Default) and Section 315(c) (Duties of the Trustee in Case of Default) of the TIA, as amended; (ii) upon the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, the Trustee shall not be required to take any further directions from holders of the Subordinated Notes under Section 5.12 (Control by Holders) of the Subordinated Indenture, which section authorizes holders of a majority in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Notes to direct certain actions relating to the Subordinated Notes. The Indenture shall impose no duties upon the Trustee whatsoever with respect to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the completion of the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, the Subordinated Notes remain outstanding (for example, if the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power results in only a partial write-down of the principal of the Subordinated Notes), then the Trustee’s duties under the Indenture shall remain applicable with respect to the Subordinated Notes following such completion to the extent that LBG and the Trustee agree pursuant to a supplemental indenture, unless LBG and the Trustee agree that a supplemental indenture is not necessary; and (iii) it shall be deemed to have (i) consented to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power as it may be imposed without any prior notice by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of its decision to exercise such power with respect to the Subordinated Notes and (ii) authorized, directed and requested the Clearing Systems to take any and all necessary action, if required, to implement the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power with respect to the Subordinated Notes as it may be imposed, without any further action or direction on the part of such holder or beneficial owner or the Trustee. Upon the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Subordinated Notes, we shall provide a written notice to the Clearing Systems as soon as practicable regarding such exercise of the U.K. bail-in power for purposes of notifying holders and beneficial owners of such occurrence. We shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Trustee for information purposes only. For a discussion of certain risk factors relating to the U.K. bail-in power, see “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Subordinated Notes” in this prospectus supplement. Repayment of Principal and Payment of Interest After Exercise of U.K. Bail-in Power No repayment of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes or payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes shall become due and payable after the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority unless, at the time that such repayment or payment, respectively, is scheduled to become due, such repayment or payment would be permitted to be made by us under the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom applicable to us and the Group.S- 4Additional Issuances We may, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and same interest rate, maturity date, redemption terms and other terms as the Subordinated Notes described in this prospectus supplement except for the price to the public, issue date and first Interest Payment Date, provided however that such additional notes that form part of the same series as the Subordinates Notes must be fungible with the outstanding Subordinated Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Additional Issuances” in this prospectus supplement. Tax Redemption If at any time a Tax Event has occurred, LBG may, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Conditions to Redemption, Purchase, Substitution or Variation”, redeem the Subordinated Notes in whole but not in part at any time at 100% of their principal amount, together with any Accrued Interest to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. A “Tax Event” will be deemed to have occurred if LBG determines that: (1) as a result of a Tax Law Change, in making any payments on the Subordinated Notes, LBG has paid or will or would on the next payment date be required to pay any Additional Amounts to any holder pursuant to “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts” and/or (2) a Tax Law Change would: · result in LBG not being entitled to claim a deduction in respect of any payments (or its corresponding funding costs as recognized in its financial statements) in respect of the Subordinated Notes in computing its taxation liabilities or the amount or value of such deduction to LBG would be materially reduced; · prevent the Subordinated Notes from being treated as loan relationships for United Kingdom tax purposes; · as a result of the Subordinated Notes being in issue, result in LBG not being able to have losses or deductions set against the profits or gains, or profits or gains offset by the losses or deductions, of companies with which it is or would otherwise be so grouped for applicable United Kingdom tax purposes (whether under the group relief system current as of the Issue Date or any similar system or systems having like effect as may from time to time exist); · result in a United Kingdom tax liability, or the receipt of income or profit which would be subject to United Kingdom tax, in respect of a write-down of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes or the conversion of the Subordinated Notes into shares or other obligations of LBG (including, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Subordinated Notes or as a result of the exercise of any regulatory powers under the Banking Act 2009); or · result in a Subordinated Note or any part thereof being treated as a derivative or an embedded derivative for United Kingdom tax purposes,S- 5in each case, provided that, LBG could not avoid the foregoing in connection with the Subordinated Notes by taking measures reasonably available to it. “Tax Law Change” means a change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United Kingdom, or any political subdivision or authority therein or thereof, having the power to tax, including any treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party, or any change in any generally published application or interpretation of such laws, including a decision of any court or tribunal, or any change in the generally published application or interpretation of such laws by any relevant tax authority or any generally published pronouncement by any tax authority, which change, amendment or pronouncement (x) (subject to (y)) becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (as defined herein), or (y) in the case of a change in law, if such change is enacted by United Kingdom Act of Parliament or implemented by statutory instrument, on or after the Issue Date. Capital Disqualification Event Redemption We may redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a Capital Disqualification Event, as defined under “Description of the Subordinated Notes”, that results in the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes being fully excluded from inclusion in LBG’s and/or the Group’s Tier 2 capital, as described under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Redemption due to a Capital Disqualification Event” in this prospectus supplement. Any such right of redemption will be subject to the conditions set forth under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Conditions to Redemption, Purchase, Substitution or Variation” in this prospectus supplement. Substitution or Variation If a Capital Disqualification Event has occurred and is continuing, then LBG may, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, at any time (whether before, on or following the Reset Date) either substitute all (but not some only) of the Subordinated Notes for, or vary the terms of the Subordinated Notes so that they remain or, as appropriate, become, Compliant Securities (as defined herein), and the Trustee shall agree to such substitution or variation. Upon the expiry of such notice, LBG shall either vary the terms of or substitute the Subordinated Notes, as the case may be. See “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Substitution or Variation” in this prospectus supplement). Any such right of substitution or variation will be subject to the conditions set forth under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Conditions to Redemption, Purchase, Substitution or Variation” in this prospectus supplement.S- 6Purchases of the Subordinated Notes We may at any time, and from time to time, purchase Subordinated Notes in the open market or by tender or by private agreement in any manner and at any price or at differing prices. Subordinated Notes purchased or otherwise acquired by us may be (i) held, (ii) resold or (iii) at our sole discretion, surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation (in which case all Subordinated Notes so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled in accordance with applicable law and thereafter may not be re-issued or resold). Any such purchases will be subject to the conditions set forth under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Conditions to Redemption, Purchase, Substitution or Variation” in this prospectus supplement. Book-Entry Issuance, Settlement and Clearance We will issue the Subordinated Notes in fully registered form in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Subordinated Notes will be represented by one or more global certificates in registered form, without coupons attached, which will be deposited with a common depositary for Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear and will be registered in the name of such common depositary or its nominee. Unless and until the Subordinated Notes are exchanged in whole or in part for other securities and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the global certificates are exchanged for definitive securities, the global certificates may not be transferred except as a whole by a Clearing System to a nominee or a successor of such Clearing System. ISIN XS2351166421 Common Code 235116642 CFI DBFXFR FISN LLOYDS BANKING/1.985EUR NT 203011215 Listing and Trading We intend to apply to list the Subordinated Notes on the New York Stock Exchange. Trustee, Paying Agent and Calculation Agent The Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of New York, acting through its London branch, having its corporate trust office at One Canada Square, London E14 5AL, United Kingdom, will act as the Trustee and will act as initial Paying Agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon, acting through its London branch, will act as Calculation Agent for the Subordinated Notes. Registrar The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch will act as registrar for the Subordinated Notes. Timing and Delivery We currently expect delivery of the Subordinated Notes to occur on or about June 15, 2021, which will be the fifth business day following the pricing of the Subordinated Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+6”). Under rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Subordinated Notes on the date of pricing or the next two succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Subordinated Notes initially will settle in T+6, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Subordinated Notes who wish to trade Subordinated Notes on the date of pricing or the next two succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.S- 7Use of Proceeds We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds”. Sole Bookrunner Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc Joint Lead Managers Barclays Bank plc and Goldman Sachs International Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest (as defined by Rule 5121 of FINRA) may exist as Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, an affiliate of the Company, may participate in the distribution of the Subordinated Notes. For further information, see “Underwriting”. Governing Law The Subordinated Indenture (as defined below), the Eighth Supplemental Indenture (as defined below) and the Subordinated Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, except for the subordination and waiver of set-off provisions relating to the Subordinated Notes which are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland.S- 8Risk FactorsProspective investors should consider carefully the risk factors incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and as set out below as well as the other information set out elsewhere in this prospectus supplement (including any other documents incorporated by reference herein) and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Subordinated Notes.Set out below and incorporated by reference herein are certain risk factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition or prospects and cause our future results to be materially different from expected results. Our results could also be affected by competition and other factors. These factors should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties we face. We have described only those risks relating to our operations or an investment in the Subordinated Notes that we consider to be material. There may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below. All of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and we are not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. Investors should note that they bear our solvency risk. Each of the risks highlighted below could have a material adverse effect on the amount of principal and interest which investors will receive in respect of the Subordinated Notes. In addition, each of the highlighted risks could adversely affect the trading price of the Subordinated Notes or the rights of investors under the Subordinated Notes and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investment. You should consult your own financial, tax and legal advisers regarding the risks of an investment in the Subordinated Notes.We believe that the factors described below as relating to the Subordinated Notes represent the principal risks inherent in investing in Subordinated Notes, but we may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Subordinated Notes for other reasons and we do not represent that the statements below regarding the risks of holding the Subordinated Notes are exhaustive. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this prospectus supplement (including any documents deemed to be incorporated by reference herein) and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.Risks relating to LBG and the GroupFor a description of the risks associated with LBG and the Group, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated by reference herein.Risks relating to the Subordinated NotesThere are limitations on the remedies available to you and the Trustee should we fail to pay principal or interest on the Subordinated Notes.The sole remedy in the event of any non-payment of principal or interest on the Subordinated Notes is that the Trustee may, on your behalf, subject to applicable laws, institute proceedings for the winding up of LBG. In the event of a winding up of LBG, whether or not instituted by the Trustee, the Trustee may file proofs of claim with respect to any of our obligations arising under the Subordinated Notes in any such winding up.The Trustee may not, however, declare the principal amount of any outstanding Subordinated Note to be due and payable in the event of such non-payment of principal or interest.See “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Events of Default; Default; Limitation of Remedies” for further details.LBG’s obligations under the Subordinated Notes are subordinated.The obligations of LBG under the Subordinated Notes will be unsecured and subordinated and will, in the event of the winding-up of LBG, rank junior in priority of payment to the current and future claims of LBG’s creditors, other than claims in respect of any liability that is, or is expressed to be, subordinated. In a winding up, all payments on the Subordinated Notes will be subordinated to, and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of, allS- 9claims of all Senior Creditors. We expect from time to time to incur additional indebtedness or other obligations that will constitute senior indebtedness, and the Indenture does not contain any provisions restricting our ability to incur senior indebtedness. Although the Subordinated Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable notes which are not so subordinated, there is a real risk that an investor in such Subordinated Notes will lose all or some of its investment should LBG become insolvent since the assets of LBG would be available to pay such amounts only after all the Senior Creditors of LBG have been paid in full. See also “—Holders of the Subordinated Notes may be required to absorb losses in the event we become subject to recovery and resolution action”.An active trading market may not develop for the Subordinated Notes.Prior to the offering, there was no existing trading market for the Subordinated Notes. We intend to apply for listing of the Subordinated Notes on the New York Stock Exchange. If, however, an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price and liquidity of the Subordinated Notes may be adversely affected. In that case, holders of the Subordinated Notes may not be able to sell Subordinated Notes at a particular time or may not be able to sell Subordinated Notes at a favorable price. The liquidity of any market for the Subordinated Notes will depend on a number of factors including:· the number of holders of the Subordinated Notes;· LBG’s credit ratings published by major credit rating agencies;· our financial performance;· the market for similar securities;· the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Subordinated Notes;· prevailing interest rates; and· the introduction of any financial transaction tax.We cannot assure you that an active market for the Subordinated Notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue. Further, unlike certain bank deposits, holders of the Subordinated Notes have no ability to require repayment of their investment unless a Default or Event of Default occurs and then only in the limited circumstances described in “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Events of Default; Default; Limitation of Remedies”.LBG’s credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Subordinated Notes and a downgrade in credit ratings, including as a result of changes in rating agencies’ views of the level of implicit sovereign support for European banks, could adversely affect the trading prices of the Subordinated Notes.LBG’s credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks relating to the market values of the Subordinated Notes. However, real or anticipated changes in LBG’s credit ratings will generally affect the market values of the Subordinated Notes. Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies that they follow, including LBG, and as such, the credit rating of LBG may be revised, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating organization at their sole discretion. Any ratings downgrade could adversely affect the trading prices of the Subordinated Notes or the trading markets for the Subordinated Notes to the extent trading markets for the Subordinated Notes develop, and any ratings improvement will not necessarily increase the value of the Subordinated Notes and will not reduce market risk and other investment risks related to the Subordinated Notes. Credit ratings (i) do not reflect the risk that interest rates may rise, which may affect the values of the Subordinated Notes, which accrue interest at a fixed rate, (ii) do not address the price, if any, at which the Subordinated Notes may be resold prior to maturity (which may be substantially less than the original offering price of the Subordinated Notes), and (iii) are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Subordinated Notes.The Subordinated Notes have early redemption risk.We retain the option (subject to, if and to the extent then required by the Relevant Regulator or the relevant Applicable Regulations, our giving notice to the Relevant Regulator and the Relevant Regulator granting usS- 10permission) to redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole, but not in part, on the applicable redemption date on at least 15 calendar days’ but no more than 30 calendar days’ prior written notice. It is more likely that we will redeem the Subordinated Notes prior to the respective maturity date to the extent that the interest payable on such notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments of ours of a comparable maturity, of comparable terms and of a comparable credit rating trading in the market. If the Subordinated Notes are redeemed prior to their respective maturity dates, you may have to re-invest the proceeds in a lower interest rate environment.We may redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time for certain tax reasons.We may (subject to, if and to the extent then required by the Relevant Regulator or the relevant Applicable Regulations, our giving notice to the Relevant Regulator and the Relevant Regulator granting us permission) redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time in whole (but not in part) upon the occurrence of certain tax changes as described in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.We may redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time following a Capital Disqualification Event.We may (subject to, if and to the extent then required by the Relevant Regulator or the relevant Applicable Regulations, our giving notice to the Relevant Regulator and the Relevant Regulator granting us permission) redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time in whole (but not in part) upon the occurrence of a Capital Disqualification Event as described in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.We may substitute the Subordinated Notes or vary their terms without holder consent.If a Capital Disqualification Event has occurred, then LBG may, subject to “Description of the Subordinated Notes —Conditions to Redemption, Purchase, Substitution or Variation”, but without any requirement for the consent or approval of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, at any time (whether before or following the Reset Date) either substitute all (but not some only) of the Subordinated Notes for, or vary the terms of the Subordinated Notes so that they remain or, as appropriate, become, Compliant Securities, and the Trustee shall agree to such substitution or variation, as provided in “Description of the Subordinated Notes —Substitution or Variation”. In the case of a substitution or variation of the terms of the Subordinated Notes, while the new substituted or modified securities must have terms that are not materially less favorable to an investor than the Subordinated Notes, there can be no assurance that, whether due to the particular circumstances of each holder of Subordinated Notes or otherwise, such substituted or modified securities will be as favorable to each holder of Subordinated Notes in all respects.Holders cannot require us to redeem the Subordinated Notes early.Holders have no right to require us to redeem the Subordinated Notes prior to the maturity date thereof.Limitation on our gross-up obligation under the Subordinated Notes.Our obligation to pay additional amounts in respect of certain withholding taxes under the terms of the Subordinated Notes applies only to payments of interest due and paid under Subordinated Notes and not to payments of principal. We will not be required to pay any additional amounts under the terms of the Subordinated Notes to the extent any withholding or deduction applied to payments of principal. Accordingly, if any such withholding or deduction were to apply to any payments of principal under the Subordinated Notes, you may receive less than the full amount due under the Subordinated Notes, and the market value of the Subordinated Notes may be adversely affected.Because the Subordinated Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate, the amount of interest payable on the Subordinated Notes on the fixed rate interest payment date may be below market interest rates.Because interest payable on the Subordinated Notes accrues at a fixed rate, there can be no guarantee that the interest you will receive on the relevant interest payment date will be equal to or greater than the market interest rate on such a date. LBG does not have any control over a number of factors that may affect market interest rates, including economic, financial, and political events, such as the tightening of monetary policy, that are important in determining the existence, magnitude, and longevity of these risks and their results. See also “—The interest rate on the Subordinated Notes will reset on the Rest Date”. You should have a view as to the fixed interest rate on the Subordinated Notes and its level relative to market interest rates before investing.S- 11The interest rate on the Subordinated Notes will reset on the Reset Date.The interest rate on the Subordinated Notes will initially be 1.985% per annum from, and including, June 15, 2021 to, but excluding, the Reset Date. From, and including, the Reset Date to, but excluding, December 15, 2031, the interest rate on the Subordinated Notes will be at a rate per annum calculated by the Calculation Agent on the Reset Determination Date as being equal to the sum of the Reset Reference Rate (expressed as a rate per annum) and 1.600%.As a result, the interest rate on the Subordinated Notes following the Reset Date may be less than its initial interest rate, which would affect the amount of any interest payments and, by extension, could affect their market value.The historical Benchmark Gilt rates are not an indication of future Benchmark Gilt rates.In the past, Benchmark Gilt rates have experienced significant fluctuations. You should note that historical levels, fluctuations and trends of Benchmark Gilt rates are not necessarily indicative of future levels. Any historical upward or downward trend in Benchmark Gilt Rates is not an indication that Benchmark Gilt rates are more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time, and you should not take the historical Benchmark rates as an indication of future rates.Under the terms of the Subordinated Notes, you will agree to be bound by and consent to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. See “—Holders of the Subordinated Notes may be required to absorb losses in the event we become subject to recovery and resolution action”.Notwithstanding any other agreements, arrangements, or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes, by purchasing or acquiring the Subordinated Notes, each holder (including each beneficial owner) of the Subordinated Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power (as defined below) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority that may result in (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Subordinated Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Subordinated Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of LBG or another person; and/or (iii) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Subordinated Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest due on the Subordinated Notes, or the dates on which interest becomes payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; any U.K. bail-in power may be exercised by means of variation of the terms of the Subordinated Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. bail-in power. With respect to (i), (ii) and (iii) above, references to principal and interest shall include payments of principal and interest that have become due and payable (including principal that has become due and payable at the maturity date), but which have not been paid, prior to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power. Each holder and each beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes will further be required to acknowledge and agree that the rights of the holders and/or beneficial owners under the Subordinated Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. See “—Holders of the Subordinated Notes may be required to absorb losses in the event we become subject to recovery and resolution action”.For these purposes, a “U.K. bail-in power” is any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification or suspension power existing from time to time under any laws, regulations, rules or requirements relating to the resolution of banks, banking group companies, credit institutions and/or investment firms incorporated in the United Kingdom in effect and applicable in the United Kingdom to us and the Group, including but not limited to any such laws, regulations, rules or requirements which are implemented, adopted or enacted within the context of the U.K. resolution regime under the Banking Act as the same has been or may be amended from time to time (whether pursuant to the Banking Reform Act 2013, secondary legislation or otherwise), pursuant to which obligations of a bank, banking group company, credit institution or investment firm or any of its affiliates can be reduced, cancelled, amended, transferred and/or converted into shares or other securities or obligations of the obligor or any otherS- 12person (and a reference to the “relevant U.K. resolution authority” is to any authority with the ability to exercise a U.K. bail-in power). For more information, see “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Agreement with Respect to the Exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power”.Holders of the Subordinated Notes may be required to absorb losses in the event we become subject to recovery and resolution action.The stated aim of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the “BRRD”) is to provide authorities designated by Member States to apply the resolution tools and exercise the resolution powers set forth in the BRRD (the “resolution authorities”) with common tools and powers to address banking crises pre-emptively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimize taxpayers’ exposure to losses. The BRRD was implemented in the United Kingdom under the Banking Act (as amended) before the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. The powers granted to the U.K. resolution authorities under the Banking Act include (but are not limited to) (i) a “write-down and conversion power” relating to Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments (including the Subordinated Notes) and (ii) a “bail-in” power relating to eligible liabilities (including the Subordinated Notes). Such powers give resolution authorities the ability to write down or write off all or a portion of the claims of certain unsecured creditors of a failing institution or group and/or to convert certain debt claims into another security, including ordinary shares of the surviving Group entity, if any, which ordinary shares may also be subject to write-down or write-off.The write-down and conversion power may be used prior to resolution and for these purposes the point of nonviability will be the point at which the relevant U.K. resolution authority determines that LBG or a member of its group meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the relevant entity will no longer be viable unless the relevant capital instruments are written down or converted or the relevant entity requires extraordinary public support, without which the relevant U.K. resolution authority determines that the relevant entity would no longer be viable. The conditions for use of the bail-in power are, in summary, that (i) the regulator determines that the bank is failing or likely to fail, (ii) having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that (ignoring the stabilization powers) action will be taken by or in respect of the bank to avoid the failure of the bank, (iii) the relevant U.K. resolution authority determines that it is necessary having regard to the public interest to exercise the bail-in power in the advancement of one of the statutory objectives of resolution and (iv) that one or more of those objectives would not be met to the same extent by the winding up of the bank. The Banking Act contains certain other limited safeguards for creditors in specific circumstances which (a) in the case of the write-down and conversion power, may provide compensation to holders of the relevant capital instruments via the issue or transfer of ordinary shares or other equity securities of the bank or its parent undertaking in certain circumstances and (b) in the case of senior creditors, aim to ensure that they do not incur greater losses than they would have incurred had the relevant financial institution been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.As the parent company of U.K. banks, we are subject to the “Special Resolution Regime” under the Banking Act, that gives wide powers in respect of U.K. banks and their parent and other group companies to HM Treasury, the Bank of England (including the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”)), and the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) in circumstances where a U.K. bank has encountered or is likely to encounter financial difficulties.It is possible that the exercise of other powers under the Banking Act, to resolve failing banks in the United Kingdom and give the authorities powers to override events of default or termination rights that might be invoked as a result of the exercise of the resolution powers, could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of the Subordinated Notes and/or a material adverse effect on the price of the Subordinated Notes. The Banking Act also gives the Bank of England the power to override, vary or impose contractual obligations between a U.K. bank, its holding company and its group undertakings for reasonable consideration, in order to enable any transferee or successor bank to operate effectively. There is also power for the U.K. Treasury to amend the law (excluding provisions made by or under the Banking Act) for the purpose of enabling it to use the regime powers effectively, potentially with retrospective effect.In addition, the Banking Act may be further amended and/or other legislation may be introduced in the United Kingdom to amend the resolution regime that would apply in the event of a bank failure or to provide regulators with other resolution powers.S- 13Finally, the determination that all or part of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes will be subject to bail-in is likely to be inherently unpredictable and may depend on a number of factors which may be outside of our control. This determination will also be made by the relevant U.K. resolution authority and there may be many factors, including factors not directly related to us or the Group, which could result in such a determination. Because of this inherent uncertainty, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the exercise of a U.K. bail-in power may occur which would result in a principal write-off or conversion to other securities, including equity. Moreover, as the criteria that the relevant U.K. resolution authority will be obliged to consider in exercising any U.K. bail-in power provide it with considerable discretion, holders of the Subordinated Notes may not be able to refer to publicly available criteria in order to anticipate a potential exercise of any such power and consequently its potential effect on us, the Group and the Subordinated Notes. Potential investors in the Subordinated Notes should consider the risk that a holder may lose all of its investment, including the principal amount plus any accrued interest, if such statutory loss absorption measures are acted upon.Holders of Subordinated Notes may have limited rights or no rights to challenge any decision of the relevant U.K. resolution authority to exercise the U.K. bail-in power or to have that decision reviewed by a judicial or administrative process or otherwise.Accordingly, trading behavior in respect of the Subordinated Notes is not necessarily expected to follow the trading behavior associated with other types of securities that are not subject to such recovery and resolution powers. Potential investors in the Subordinated Notes should consider the risk that a holder of the Subordinated Notes may lose all of its investment, including the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if such statutory loss absorption measures are acted upon or that the Subordinated Notes may be converted into ordinary shares. Further, the introduction or amendment of such recovery and resolution powers, and/or any implication or anticipation that they may be used, may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of the Subordinated Notes, even if such powers are not used.Your rights may be limited in respect of the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.There may be limited protections, if any, that will be available to holders of securities subject to the U.K. bail-in power (including the Subordinated Notes) and to the broader resolution powers of the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For example, although under the Banking Act the Bank of England’s resolution instrument with respect to the exercise of the bail-in tool must set out the provisions allowing for securities to be transferred, cancelled or modified (or any combination of these), the resolution instrument may make any other provision that the Bank of England considers to be appropriate in exercising its specific powers. Such other provisions are expected to be specific and tailored to the circumstances that have led to the exercise of the bail-in tool under the Banking Act and there is uncertainty as to the extent to which usual processes or procedures under English law will be available to holders of securities (including the Subordinated Notes). Accordingly, you may have limited or circumscribed rights to challenge any decision of the Bank of England or other relevant U.K. resolution authority to exercise its U.K. bail-in power.Other powers contemplated by the Banking Act may affect your rights under, and the value of your investment in, the Subordinated Notes.In addition to the capital instruments write-down and conversion power and the bail-in tool, the Banking Act includes powers to (a) transfer all or some of the securities issued by a U.K. bank or its parent, or all or some of the property, rights and liabilities of a U.K. bank or its parent (which would include the Subordinated Notes), to a commercial purchaser or, in the case of securities, into temporary public ownership (to HM Treasury or an HM Treasury nominee), or, in the case of property, rights or liabilities, to a bridge bank (an entity owned by the Bank of England); (b) together with another resolution tool only, transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximizing their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down; (c) override any default provisions, contracts or other agreements, including provisions that would otherwise allow a party to terminate a contract or accelerate the payment of an obligation; (d) commence certain insolvency procedures in relation to a U.K. bank; and (e) override, vary or impose contractual obligations, for reasonable consideration, between a U.K. bank or its parent and its group undertakings (including undertakings which have ceased to be members of the group), in order to enable any transferee or successor bank of the U.K. bank to operate effectively.S- 14The Banking Act also gives power to HM Treasury to make further amendments to the law for the purpose of enabling it to use these powers effectively, potentially with retrospective effect.The powers set out in the Banking Act could affect how credit institutions (and their parent companies) and investment firms are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Accordingly, the taking of any actions contemplated by the Banking Act may affect your rights under the Subordinated Notes, and the value of your Subordinated Notes may be affected by the exercise of any such powers or threat thereof.The circumstances under which the relevant U.K. resolution authority would exercise its U.K. bail-in power or other resolutions tools under the Banking Act or future legislative or regulatory proposals are uncertain, which may affect the value of your Subordinated Notes.There remains significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate nature and scope of the resolution powers under the Banking Act (and such significant uncertainty may exist with respect to any other resolution powers or tools enacted under future legislative or regulatory proposals), as well as the manner in which such powers would affect us and our securities (including the Subordinated Notes) if such powers were exercised. For example, although the exercise of the capital instruments write-down and conversion power and certain other resolution tools under the Banking Act are subject to certain pre-conditions thereunder, there remains uncertainty regarding the specific factors (including, but not limited to, factors outside our control or not directly related to us) which the Bank of England would consider in deciding whether to exercise such powers with respect to us or our securities. In particular, because the Banking Act allows for the Bank of England to exercise its discretion in choosing which resolution tool or tools to apply, it will be difficult to predict whether the exercise of the Bank of England’s resolution powers will result in a principal write-off or conversion to equity. You may not be able to refer to publicly available criteria in order to anticipate a potential exercise of any such resolution powers and consequently its potential effect on us or the Subordinated Notes.Accordingly, it is not yet possible to assess the full impact of the exercise of the U.K. bail-in power pursuant to the Banking Act or otherwise on us, and there can be no assurance that the taking of any actions contemplated therein would not adversely affect your rights, the price or value of your investment in the Subordinated Notes and/or our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Subordinated Notes.The Subordinated Notes may not be a suitable investment for investors.An investor should reach a decision to invest in the Subordinated Notes after carefully considering, in conjunction with his or her advisors, the suitability of the Subordinated Notes in light of his or her investment objectives and the other information set out in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The issue price, interest rate and yield to maturity of the Subordinated Notes are expected to reflect the additional risks borne by investors in the Subordinated Notes when compared to those of Senior Creditors and bank depositors. Neither LBG nor the Underwriters makes any recommendation as to whether the Subordinated Notes are a suitable investment for any person. See “Important Information—MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market,” “Important Information—PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors” and “Important Information— U.K. PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to U.K. retail investors.”There is no limit on the amount or type of further securities or indebtedness that LBG may issue or incur.There is no restriction on the amount of securities or other liabilities that LBG may issue or incur and which rank senior to, or pari passu with, the Subordinated Notes. The issue of any such securities or the incurrence of any such other liabilities may reduce the amount (if any) recoverable by holders of the Subordinated Notes on a winding up of LBG and may limit LBG’s ability to meet its obligations under the Subordinated Notes. In addition, the Subordinated Notes do not contain any restriction on LBG’s ability to issue securities that may have preferential rights similar to those of the Subordinated Notes or securities having similar or different provisions.S- 15The Subordinated Notes are obligations exclusively of LBG and LBG is structurally subordinated to the creditors of its subsidiaries.The Subordinated Notes are obligations exclusively of LBG. LBG is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries. LBG’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and have no obligation to pay any amounts due or to provide LBG with funds to meet any of LBG’s payment obligations. LBG’s rights to participate in the assets of any subsidiary if such subsidiary is liquidated will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary’s creditors and any preference shareholders, except in the limited circumstance where LBG is a creditor with claims that are recognized to be ranked ahead of or pari passu with such claims. Accordingly, if one of LBG’s subsidiaries were to be wound up, liquidated or dissolved, (i) the holders of the Subordinated Notes would have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary, and (ii) the liquidator of such subsidiary would first apply the assets of such subsidiary to settle the claims of the creditors of such subsidiary, including holders (which may include LBG) of any preference shares and other tier 1 capital instruments of such other subsidiary, before LBG, to the extent LBG is an ordinary shareholder of such other subsidiary and would be entitled to receive any distributions from such other subsidiary.The Subordinated Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or any other government agency.The Subordinated Notes are our obligations but are not bank deposits. In the event of our insolvency, the Subordinated Notes will rank equally with our other unsecured, subordinated obligations and will not have the benefit of any insurance or guarantee of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, The Deposit Insurance Fund, the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or any other government agency.Changes in law may adversely affect the rights of holders of the Subordinated Notes or may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial performance and capital plans.Any changes in law or regulations after the date hereof that trigger a Capital Disqualification Event or a Tax Event would entitle LBG, at its option, to redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole but not in part, as described in more detail under “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Redemption due to a Capital Disqualification Event” and “Description of the Subordinated Notes—Tax Redemption”. See also “—We may redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time for certain tax reasons” and “—We may redeem the Subordinated Notes at any time following a Capital Disqualification Event”.Holders of the Subordinated Notes may find it difficult to enforce civil liabilities against LBG or LBG’s directors or officers.LBG is incorporated as a public limited company and is registered in Scotland and LBG’s directors and officers reside outside of the United States. In addition, all or a substantial portion of LBG’s assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of the Subordinated Notes to effect service of process within the United States on such persons or to enforce judgments against them, including in any action based on civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.Investors should be aware that the materialization of any of the above risks (including those risks incorporated herein by reference) may adversely affect the value of the Subordinated Notes.S- 16Use of ProceedsThe net proceeds from the sale of the Subordinated Notes, less the underwriting compensation stated on the cover of this prospectus supplement and expenses payable by us estimated at £186,472 (based on the latest pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of £1.00/U.S. $1.4175, as announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on June 4, 2021), are estimated to be £498,313,528. These proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.Capitalization of the GroupThe Group’s capitalization and indebtedness on a consolidated basis in accordance with IFRS as at March 31, 2021 is set out in the report on Form 6-K dated April 28, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein.S- 17Description of the Subordinated NotesThe following is a summary of certain terms of the Subordinated Notes. It supplements the description of the general terms of the debt securities of any series we may issue contained in the accompanying prospectus under the heading “Description of Debt Securities”. If there is any inconsistency between the following summary and the description in the accompanying prospectus, the following summary governs.The Subordinated Notes will be issued in an aggregate principal amount of £500,000,000 and will mature on December 15, 2031. Interest will accrue on the Subordinated Notes from (and including) the date of issuance to (but excluding) December 15, 2026 (the “Reset Date”), at a rate of 1.985% per annum (the “Initial Interest Rate”), and from (and including) the Reset Date to (but excluding) maturity (the “Reset Period”), at a rate per annum calculated by the Calculation Agent on the Reset Determination Date (as defined below) as being equal to the sum of the Reset Reference Rate (as defined below) (expressed as a rate per annum) and 1.600% (the “Margin”), such sum being converted to a semi-annual rate in accordance with market convention (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 rounded down) (the “Reset Rate of Interest”). Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing on December 15, 2021 to (and including) maturity. Interest will be paid to holders of record of the Subordinated Notes in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding at the close of business of the relevant Clearing System on the Clearing System Business Day immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.Interest on the Subordinated Notes will be calculated on the basis of the number of days in the relevant period, from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue to, but excluding, the date on which it falls due, divided by the actual number of days in the interest period in which the relevant period falls (including the first such day but excluding the last). If any scheduled Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, we will pay interest on the next Business Day, but interest on that payment will not accrue during the period from and after the scheduled Interest Payment Date. If the scheduled maturity date or date of redemption or repayment is not a Business Day, we may pay interest and principal on the next succeeding Business Day, but interest on that payment will not accrue during the period from and after the scheduled maturity date or date of redemption or repayment.All calculations of the Calculation Agent, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on LBG, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and on the holders of the Subordinated Notes.All pounds sterling amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest pence (with one half-pence being rounded upwards).Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reset Rate of Interest in accordance with the foregoing provisions would otherwise be lower than 0% per annum, the Reset Rate of Interest will be 0% per annum.There shall be no Deferred Payment Dates (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) in respect of the Subordinated Notes.In this description of the Subordinated Notes, the following expressions have the following meanings:“Applicable Regulations” means, at any time, the laws, regulations, requirements, guidelines and policies relating to capital adequacy and prudential supervision (including, without limitation, as to leverage) then in effect in the United Kingdom including, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing (and for so long as the same are applicable in the United Kingdom), any delegated or implementing acts (such as regulatory technical standards) adopted by the European Commission and any regulations, requirements, guidelines and policies relating to capital adequacy adopted by the Relevant Regulator, from time to time (whether or not such requirements, guidelines or policies are applied generally or specifically to LBG or the Group (as defined below)).“Business Day” means any day, other than Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in London, England.“Capital Disqualification Event” shall be deemed to have occurred if at any time LBG determines that there is a change (which has occurred or which the Relevant Regulator considers to be sufficiently certain) in the regulatoryS- 18classification of the Subordinated Notes which becomes effective after June 15, 2021 (the “Issue Date”) and that results, or would be likely to result, in the entire principal amount of the Subordinated Notes being excluded from the Tier 2 Capital of LBG and/or the Group (other than as a result of any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital).“Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg is open for business.“Group” means LBG and its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings from time to time.“London Banking Day” means any day (other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday) in which dealings in pounds sterling are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market.“Relevant Regulator” means the Bank of England acting as the Prudential Regulation Authority through its Prudential Regulation Committee or such other governmental authority in the United Kingdom (or if LBG becomes domiciled in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, in such other jurisdiction) having primary supervisory authority with respect to LBG and/or the Group in such circumstances.“Reset Determination Date” means the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the Reset Date.“Reset Reference Banks” means five leading gilt dealers in the principal interbank market relating to sterling selected by LBG.“Reset Reference Rate” means in respect of the Reset Period, the gross redemption yield (as calculated by the Calculation Agent on the basis set out by the United Kingdom Debt Management Office in the paper “Formulae for Calculating Gilt Prices from Yields”, page 5, Section One: Price/Yield Formulae “Conventional Gilts”; Double dated and Undated Gilts with Assumed (or Actual) Redemption on a Quasi-Coupon Date (published 8 June 1998, as amended or updated from time to time) or if such basis is no longer in customary market usage at such time, in accordance with generally accepted market practice at such time) on a semi-annual compounding basis (converted to an annualized yield and rounded up (if necessary) to three decimal places) of the Benchmark Gilt in respect of the Reset Period, with the price of the Benchmark Gilt for the purpose of determining the gross redemption yield being the arithmetic average rounded (if necessary) to the nearest 0.001 per cent. (0.0005 per cent. being rounded upwards)) of the bid and offered prices of such Benchmark Gilt quoted by the Reset Reference Banks at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Reset Determination Date on a dealing basis for settlement on the next following dealing day in London. Such quotations shall be obtained by or on behalf of LBG and provided to the Calculation Agent. If at least four quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Rate will be determined by reference to the rounded arithmetic mean of the quotations provided, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest). If only two or three quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Rate will be determined by reference to the rounded arithmetic mean of the quotations provided. If only one quotation is provided, the Reset Reference Rate will be determined by reference to the rounded quotation provided. If no quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Rate shall be the Initial Interest Rate less the Margin, where:(i) “Benchmark Gilt” means, in respect of the Reset Period, such United Kingdom government security customarily used in the pricing of new issues having a term of five years as LBG (on the advice of an investment bank of international repute) may determine to be appropriate following any guidance published by the International Capital Market Association at the relevant time; and(ii) “dealing day” means a day on which the London Stock Exchange plc (or such other stock exchange on which the Benchmark Gilt is at the relevant time listed) is ordinarily open for the trading of securities.“Senior Creditors” means in respect of LBG (i) creditors of LBG whose claims are admitted to proof in the winding-up or administration of LBG and who are unsubordinated creditors of LBG and (ii) creditors of LBG whose claims are or are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of other creditors of LBG (other than those whose claims constitute, or would, but for any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital, constitute Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital of LBG, or whose claims rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the Subordinated Notes).S- 19“Tier 1 Capital” has the meaning given to it by the Relevant Regulator from time to time.“Tier 2 Capital” has the meaning given to it by the Relevant Regulator from time to time.GeneralThe Subordinated Notes will constitute our direct, unconditional, unsecured, unguaranteed and subordinated obligations ranking pari passu without any preference among themselves and ranking junior in right of payment to the claims of any existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of LBG. In a winding up or in the event that an administrator has been appointed in respect of us and notice has been given that it intends to declare and distribute a dividend, all amounts due in respect of or arising under (including any damages awarded for breach of any obligations under) the Subordinated Notes will be subordinated to, and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of, all claims of all Senior Creditors.The rights and claims of the holders of the Subordinated Notes shall rank at least pari passu with the claims of holders of all obligations of LBG which constitute, or would but for any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital constitute, Tier 2 Capital of LBG and in priority to (1) the claims of holders of all obligations of LBG which constitute Tier 1 Capital of LBG, (2) the claims of holders of all undated or perpetual subordinated obligations of LBG and (3) the claims of holders of all share capital of LBG.In addition, because we are a holding company, our rights to participate in the assets of any subsidiary if it is liquidated will be subject to the prior claims of its creditors, including in the case of bank subsidiaries, their depositors, except to the extent that we may be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.The Subordinated Notes will constitute a separate series of subordinated debt securities issued under the indenture dated as of November 4, 2014 (the “Subordinated Indenture”) between us and The Bank of New York Mellon acting through its London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as amended by an eighth supplemental indenture to be dated as of June 15, 2021 (the “Eighth Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Subordinated Indenture, the “Indenture”) between us and the Trustee. Book-entry interests in the Subordinated Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.The Bank of New York Mellon, acting through its London Branch, is designated as the paying agent. We may at any time designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of paying agents or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts.We will issue the Subordinated Notes in fully registered form. Upon issuance, the Subordinated Notes will be represented by one or more fully registered global certificates (“Global Certificates”). Each such Global Certificate will be deposited with a common depositary for Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear” and, together with Clearstream, Luxembourg, the “Clearing Systems”) and registered in the name of such common depositary or its nominee. You will hold a beneficial interest in the Subordinated Notes through the facilities of Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear. For a more detailed summary of the form of the Subordinated Notes and settlement and clearance arrangements, you should read “Description of Certain Provisions Relating to Debt Securities and Capital Securities—Form of Debt Securities and Capital Securities; Book-Entry System” in the accompanying prospectus.Secondary market trading will occur in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and clearing system operating procedures of Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, as the case may be. Definitive debt securities will only be issued in limited circumstances described under “Description of Certain Provisions Relating to Debt Securities and Capital Securities—Form of Debt Securities and Capital Securities; Book-Entry System” in the accompanying prospectus.Payment of principal of and interest, if any, on the Subordinated Notes, so long as the Subordinated Notes are represented by Global Certificates, will be made in immediately available funds. Beneficial interests in the Global Certificates will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, as the case may be, and secondary market trading activity in such interests will therefore settle in same-day funds.S- 20All payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes by us or our paying agent will be made subject to any deduction or withholding that may be imposed or levied by any jurisdiction. Except as provided under “—Payment of Additional Amounts” in the accompanying prospectus, no additional amounts will be paid on the Subordinated Notes with respect to any such amounts withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if by reason of any agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”), any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction with respect to FATCA, or any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted or issued in any jurisdiction implementing, or relating to, FATCA or any intergovernmental agreement, any of us, the Trustee, our paying agent or another withholding agent deducts and withholds from any amount payable on, or in respect of, the Subordinated Notes, the amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of the Subordinated Notes, and no additional amounts will be paid on account of any such deduction or withholding. Neither we, the Trustee nor our paying agent shall have any liability in connection with our compliance with any such withholding obligation under applicable law.Agreement with Respect to the Exercise of U.K. Bail-in PowerNotwithstanding any other agreements, arrangements, or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes by purchasing or acquiring the Subordinated Notes, each holder (including each beneficial owner) of the Subordinated Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power (as defined below) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority that may result in (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Subordinated Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, the Subordinated Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of LBG or another person (and the issue to or conferral on the holder of such shares, securities or obligations), including by means of amendment, modification or variation of the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and/or (iii) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Subordinated Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest due on the Subordinated Notes, or the dates on which interest becomes payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; any U.K. bail-in power may be exercised by means of variation of the terms of the Subordinated Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. bail-in power. With respect to (i), (ii) and (iii) above, references to principal and interest shall include payments of principal and interest that have become due and payable (including principal that has become due and payable at the maturity date), but which have not been paid, prior to the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power. Each holder and each beneficial owner of the Subordinated Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders and/or beneficial owners under the Subordinated Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. bail-in power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.For these purposes, a “U.K. bail-in power” is any write-down and/or conversion power existing from time to time under any laws, regulations, rules or requirements rela",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.33,0.14,0.53,True,English,,"['banking', '424b2', 'lbg', 'relevant', 'lloyds', 'bailin', 'notes', 'power', 'uk', 'including', 'subordinated', 'resolution', 'group', 'form', 'interest']",2021-06-09,streetinsider.com,Euroclear

Such a late date would leave little room for manoeuvre if the candidate were to fall through.The three said that German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer was the preferred candidate.Mr Weimer, however, has publicly dismissed the idea saying earlier this year that his taking the post was ""not at all a topic of discussion"".

Although the precious metal kicked off the new week on a positive note, market movement remained subdued until midweek, especially across currency markets, as market players anxiously awaited yesterday's news.The day, in fact, held two highlights in store. First, the ECB meeting confirmed the low expectations for dramatic changes in monetary policy, with plans to continue its increased pace of bond purchases into the third quarter of 2021. The statements of ECB President Christine Lagarde were characterised by greater optimism concerning the economic outlook for 2021 and 2022, which in turn might cause the ECB to take stock and curb its monetary policy measures come September.US inflation, on the other hand, exceeded even the loftiest expectations in May, rising from 4.2 per cent in April to 5.0 per cent, a 13-year high. In an initial reaction, the euro weakened against the US dollar, as did gold. Over the course of the afternoon, US capital market interest rates dropped alongside rising inflation expectations. This resulted in negative real interest rates (capital market interest rates minus inflation expectations) which plummeted to levels even lower than before publication of the data, whereupon the gold price recovered. Market participants are obviously expecting the Fed to regard the extremely high inflation rates as a temporary phenomenon and thus tolerate them. The Fed, therefore, is also likely to maintain a course of expansive monetary policy for some time to come.Over the course of this week, the gold price climbed from 1,870 US$ per ounce last Friday morning to 1,903.50 on Tuesday afternoon. The setback immediately after publication of the inflation data took gold back to 1,870; however, it quickly regained the 1,890 mark and traded around 1,900 US$ per ounce this morning.The price of Xetra-Gold also rose moderately. Within regular trading, it initially advanced from 49.65 € per gram last Friday to a weekly high of 50.25 on Tuesday afternoon. It dropped to 49.45 yesterday, but quickly bounced back and traded around 50.10 € per gram this morning.Next week, market participants will keep a close eye on the upcoming Fed meeting on Wednesday, in particular on any comments or indications regarding the high inflation.I wish all our readers a relaxing and sunny weekend.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.1,0.65,True,English,,"['remains', 'hits', 'expectations', 'gold', 'high', 'publication', 'market', 'deutsche', 'rates', 'gmbh', 'börse', 'price', 'commodities', 'week', 'policy', 'inflation', 'demand']",2021-06-11,marketscreener.com,Euroclear

Billions of euros in daily euro stock and derivatives trading have already left London for the EU.Both sides have agreed to start a dialogue via an informal forum for discussing financial rules, but it has yet to go live and Katharine Braddick, director of financial services at Britain's finance ministry, said she hoped it was expedited.""Once that memorandum of understanding is agreed we can get on with establishing our routine ways of engaging,"" Braddick told TheCityUK's annual conference.The forum, which will not decide on financial market access, but it is viewed as critical to mend bridges, would put Britain's EU relationship on a ""reliable, transparent and understandable footing"" to give business certainty, she added.John Berrigan, head of the European Commission's financial services unit, said the EU remains open to the rest of the world. ""This is not about disengaging,"" Berrigan added.The Commission said work on approving the forum was ongoing.A pressing issue for Britain is that EU permission for the London Stock Exchange to keep clearing euros derivatives for EU customers expires in June 2022, potentially fragmenting a major market involving trillions of euros.The Commission is asking banks and asset managers how quickly they can shift this clearing from London to Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) in Frankfurt and if legislation is needed.The EU wants to directly supervise euro clearing and bolster its ""open strategic autonomy"" to avoid reliance on the City.""I think it's critically important for the EU to remain open and to resist the protectionist temptation,"" London Stock Exchange Chief Executive David Schwimmer told a separate European Financial Services conference.""What has made the EU so successful is its openness to the world and being able to embed itself in global ecosystems.""EU firms should be able to access the same liquidity, services, data and technology capabilities as their peers in respect to clearing, Schwimmer said.""I am not arguing for an absence of control by the EU over important strategic areas,"" he said.WASHINGTON WARYWith Britain no longer tied to EU rules, it is reforming how it regulates the City to buttress its global competitiveness.Braddick said this would mean tailoring rules within a framework of global standards, and not ripping up the rulebook.""Any idea there is some vast philosophical gap about risk appetite or financial regulation is really misplaced,"" she said.Britain's finance ministry will make detailed proposals for wholesale financial market reform in the final quarter of 2021.""We have not seen a flood of either talent or capital out of the UK into the European Union,"" Braddick said.U.S. officials sounded a note of caution against the EU fragmenting financial markets after Brexit.""The future of our financial services relationship really needs to be based on principles of openness, financial market integration and of course competition,"" Sharon Yang, deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury, said.Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.02,0.58,0.4,mixed,0.16,0.12,0.72,True,English,,"['finance', 'european', 'services', 'financial', 'urges', 'open', 'talks', 'eu', 'market', 'london', 'stock', 'expedite', 'exchange', 'britain']",2021-06-15,reuters.com,Euroclear

The 64-year-old has survived three shareholder votes on whether to oust him but said he will go next year.With less than a year to go, the bank’s supervisor, the ECB, is still waiting for Deutsche to identify a successor and has ratcheted up pressure on Germany’s biggest bank and its chairman in recent months, the people said.The ECB’s chief supervisor Andrea Enria has addressed this question multiple times in ongoing high-level communication with the bank, said one of the people, who is an official with direct knowledge of the matter.Deutsche Bank declined to comment.Deutsche has recently returned to profit but remains under the close watch of regulators who guard the health of the global financial system, of which the bank, as one of the world’s biggest lenders, is a critical part.In particular, they have been concerned by lapses in Deutsche’s money laundering controls – a problem that extends back throughout Achleitner’s tenure.DemandsIn a major setback for Deutsche, Germany’s financial watchdog BaFin in April ordered it to enact further money laundering safeguards and extended a mandate for a special monitor to keep track of progress.The ECB is making the repeated demands because it wants Achleitner to leave in an orderly fashion, with the central bank having enough time to vet the candidate to replace him, the people said.Three people familiar with the bank’s search for a successor said there was a shortlist of three German men, with one adding that Deutsche would be ready to announce a successor by February or March next year.Such a late date would leave little room for manoeuvre if the candidate were to fall through.The three said that German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer was the preferred candidate.Weimer, however, has publicly dismissed the idea saying earlier this year that his taking the post was “not at all a topic of discussion”.

Merkens, who resigned from his duties for medical reasons as at 30 April 2021. The appointment of Jochen Klösges is still subject to approval of the supervisory authority (ECB). Management Board members Marc Hess and Thomas Ortmanns will continue to perform the CEO's duties until Jochen Klösges assumes office. The future CEO of Aareal Bank AG currently serves as CEO of E.R. Capital Holding GmbH & Cie. KG of Hamburg-based entrepreneur Erck Rickmers. In this function, he has been responsible for a broad range of business activities in the property, renewable energies, asset management, private equity and shipping areas over recent years. Jochen Klösges made a key contribution towards shifting the entrepreneurial focus from shipping to properties and renewable energies. From 2009 until 2013 he was a member of the Management Board of Commerzbank AG, where he held responsibility, among others, for the commercial property financing, asset management & leasing, ship finance and public-sector financing business segments which he restructured successfully. From 2007 until 2009, Jochen Klösges also held the position of Head of Strategy at Commerzbank. Prior to this, he worked at Eurohypo AG for five years, starting out as Head of Risk Management, before assuming the role of Management Board member in 2004. Later, he led the Supervisory Board of the property financer for Commerzbank. Marija Korsch, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Aareal Bank AG, stated: ""We are delighted that we were able to win Jochen Klösges as Chairman of the Management Board. He has a wide range of experience in all key areas of the property financing and banking business, especially in property financing, also showing entrepreneurial spirit, client orientation and strategic thinking. The Supervisory Board is convinced that, under his leadership, the Bank will continue its successful path in the future and that it will be able to provide the right strategic answers in times of fundamental change. Until Jochen Klösges assumes office, we know that management of Aareal Bank Group is in the best hands of our experienced and proven Management Board team, especially Marc Hess and Thomas Ortmanns. On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to them for their great work and willingness to take on additional responsibilities."" Jochen Klösges explained: ""Aareal Bank is one of the leading international institutions in its market segment that enjoys excellent reputation among its clients. The fact that it has the innovative, high-growth software company Aareon in its portfolio is an aspect which other institutions rightfully envy. I am very much looking forward to further expediting profitable growth in all segments of Aareal Bank Group, together with the management team."" In view of the now foreseeable end of the substituting phase for the CEO, Thomas Ortmanns will, at his own request, retire from the Management Board early with effect from 30 September 2021, in accordance with his personal plans for the future. He has been a member of the Management Board since 2005 and is responsible for the Banking & Digital Solutions and Aareon segments. Following Thomas Ortmanns' early retirement, Jochen Klösges will take over his functions for the time being. The Supervisory Board will decide upon the future structure, size and distribution of tasks on the Management Board in due course and with the involvement of the entire Management Board. Marija Korsch commented on the planned early retirement of Thomas Ortmanns: ""We respect the personal request by Thomas Ortmanns, to focus on other priorities in life going forward. He has contributed to shaping Aareal Bank Group through more than fifteen years of successful work on the Management Board. He was instrumental in enabling the Bank to consistently expand its position as a reliable banking partner to the housing industry - and also in ensuring that Aareon in particular has evolved into the true gem that it is today. On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to express our sincere thanks to him and wish him all the best for his future."" Following his retirement, Thomas Ortmanns will continue to be available to Aareal Bank Group in an advisory capacity for a transitional period.

Tolga Akmen/Pool via REUTERS//File PhotoLONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry called on the European Union to open talks on financial services, after the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday urged the bloc to avoid protectionism.Britain left the EU in December, largely cutting off the City of London's financial services centre from many of the markets it had formerly played a central role in.Banks and other financial firms that used London as a gateway to Europe have set up units in the EU to avoid disruption for EU clients. Billions of euros in daily euro stock and derivatives trading have already left London for the EU.Both sides have agreed to start a dialogue via an informal forum for discussing financial rules, but it has yet to go live and Katharine Braddick, director of financial services at Britain's finance ministry, said she hoped it was expedited.""Once that memorandum of understanding is agreed we can get on with establishing our routine ways of engaging,"" Braddick told TheCityUK's annual conference.The forum, which will not decide on financial market access, but it is viewed as critical to mend bridges, would put Britain's EU relationship on a ""reliable, transparent and understandable footing"" to give business certainty, she added.John Berrigan, head of the European Commission's financial services unit, said the EU remains open to the rest of the world. ""This is not about disengaging,"" Berrigan added.The Commission said work on approving the forum was ongoing.A pressing issue for Britain is that EU permission for the London Stock Exchange to keep clearing euros derivatives for EU customers expires in June 2022, potentially fragmenting a major market involving trillions of euros.The Commission is asking banks and asset managers how quickly they can shift this clearing from London to Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) in Frankfurt and if legislation is needed.The EU wants to directly supervise euro clearing and bolster its ""open strategic autonomy"" to avoid reliance on the City.""I think it's critically important for the EU to remain open and to resist the protectionist temptation,"" London Stock Exchange Chief Executive David Schwimmer told a separate European Financial Services conference.""What has made the EU so successful is its openness to the world and being able to embed itself in global ecosystems.""EU firms should be able to access the same liquidity, services, data and technology capabilities as their peers in respect to clearing, Schwimmer said.""I am not arguing for an absence of control by the EU over important strategic areas,"" he said.WASHINGTON WARYWith Britain no longer tied to EU rules, it is reforming how it regulates the City to buttress its global competitiveness.Braddick said this would mean tailoring rules within a framework of global standards, and not ripping up the rulebook.""Any idea there is some vast philosophical gap about risk appetite or financial regulation is really misplaced,"" she said.Britain's finance ministry will make detailed proposals for wholesale financial market reform in the final quarter of 2021.""We have not seen a flood of either talent or capital out of the UK into the European Union,"" Braddick said.U.S. officials sounded a note of caution against the EU fragmenting financial markets after Brexit.""The future of our financial services relationship really needs to be based on principles of openness, financial market integration and of course competition,"" Sharon Yang, deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury, said.Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.03,0.55,0.42,mixed,0.16,0.12,0.72,True,English,,"['finance', 'european', 'services', 'financial', 'urges', 'open', 'talks', 'eu', 'market', 'london', 'stock', 'expedite', 'exchange', 'britain']",2021-06-15,reuters.com,Euroclear

We are looking to extend that network according to our clients’ priorities.”He continued that clearing members run complex businesses, where multiple legal entities are often facing multiple CCPs and acting on behalf of clients, in addition to their own in-house business. Baton allows firms to view all this information in a single dashboard.“We allow firms to see normalised aggregated information on an intra-day basis to allow them to make better decisions,” added Knight.Christopher Giancarlo, Willkie Farr & GallagherBaton was founded in 2016 by technology, payments and capital markets veterans. In April this year J. Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, joined Baton as senior advisor. Giancarlo is currently senior counsel to law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project to advance consideration of a U.S. central bank digital currencyGiancarlo said in a statement: “Baton is enabling a solution that is working today to improve the speed and precision of collateral management.”LCHIn May this year Baton said J.P. Morgan will be the first client to manage their collateral at LCH using its platform. In 2019 Baton and the bank developed a solution that enables the near real-time orchestration of cash and collateral transfers to multiple clearing houses.Baton Systems has integrated with LCH_Clearing to automate the end-to-end collateral workflow for derivatives participants. jpmorgan will be the first of Baton’s clients to manage their collateral at LCH using the Baton platform.  fintech  derivatives — Baton Systems (batonsystems) May 6, 2021Knight said the LCH integration was a really important step in the further development of Baton’s network for automating collateral workflow for cleared derivatives.“Establishing a two-way connection with LCH was very high on the list of requirements from our clearing member clients,” he added.Baton consumes end of day and intra-day data from clearing houses regarding positions, margin requirements and eligibility information. Clearing members’ instructions for the movement of collateral are then integrated back into the CCP by Baton.Anthony Fraser, head of global clearing operations and cost & commission services at J.P. Morgan, said in a statement: “This will bring further efficiency in our collateral management process and will provide greater real-time visibility of our margin and collateral holdings.”Alex Knight, Baton SystemsKnight explained that Baton also allows clearing member firms to see their obligations and the holdings they have at their custodians. In addition, by having up-to-date information on eligibility and concentration limits etc. and data from the CCP on haircuts being applied to assets, the decision making process becomes much more robust.Baton also performs pre-checks with the CCP to determine if the instructions, individually or collectively, will result in a breach and a likely rejection.“By automatically tracking the progress of instructions and collateral movement we provide a huge amount of visibility, flexibility and control to the clearing firm,” Knight added.Clearing firms can also set up automatic alerts or automated collateral movements when certain thresholds are breached so there is straight-through processing for collateral posting with little manual intervention required.MarginsKnight continued that clearing firms often hold excess collateral at CCPs and by having access to better data and being able to respond more quickly, this can be reduced and lead to a material benefit in lowering the cost of funding.“Clearing firms can receive a meaningful uplift in net interest income which has become more important because collateral or margin requirements at the CCPs are now so high,” he said.Clarus Financial Technology, the derivatives analytics provider, said in a blog that initial margin for interest rate swaps remains close to record highs.What’s new in CCP Quant Disclosures – 4Q20?  — Clarus (clarusft) April 14, 2021CCPs publish more than 200 quantitative data fields including margin, default resources, credit risk, collateral, liquidity risk, back-testing under the CPMI-IOSCO public quantitative disclosures.Amir Khwaja, chief executive of Clarus wrote that initial margin for swaps has remained at the record highs from 31 Mar 2020, the Covid-19 crash quarter.“A little surprising that initial margin has not come down given the lower market volatility, but then again the risk position of members at CCPs on 31 December 2020 will not have been the same as on 31March 2020,” added Khwaja.Knight continued that Baton experienced an uplift in interest after the very high volatility last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the operational processes of many firms struggled to keep up because of the manual intervention required. In addition visibility of data was a problem as most firms relied purely on end-of-day reports.“The need to have up-to-date data was really important when firms were scrambling for liquidity,” added Knight. “One clearing member said after the event that they spent many hours cobbling together reports so the benefit of aggregation and seeing data in a consistent, reliable format is huge.”In addition, one of the impediments to scaling a clearing business can be the highly manual processes between the clearing firms and their underlying clients. “That is a space where we can do some great work and we are talking to a couple of our customers,” said Knight.He continued that Baton’s distributed ledger technology means firms can fund their liquidity as efficiently as possible as they can choose to run multiple settlement cycles during the day.“The industry pays hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund liquidity, so trying to help to solve this issue is really key,” Knight added.FXBefore joining Baton Systems, Knight spent 18 years at Citi, where he was most recently global head of sales and client coverage for Citi’s FX Prime Brokerage and had also set up and run the bank’s Asia Pacific FX Prime Brokerage business from Singapore.In January this year 2021 Baton entered into a partnership to combine its payments infrastructure with Cobalt, the foreign exchange and digital asset infrastructure provider, to provide a seamless end-to-end FX settlement solution.Company announcement: Cobalt and Baton Systems partner to streamline post-t…   fintech — Finextra (Finextra) January 19, 2021Arjun Jayaram, chief executive of Baton Systems, said in a statement that the the increased market volatility in 2020 exposed the underlying issues with liquidity, operational infrastructure and settlement that have hindered the industry for decades.“By integrating our real-time payment versus payment FX settlement process with Cobalt we can deliver improved visibility and control over the settlement process to a new segment of the market, eliminating many of the systemic risks currently plaguing the industry,” added Jayaram.",neutral,0.24,0.67,0.09,mixed,0.4,0.08,0.52,True,English,"['Baton Systems', 'LCH', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Baton Systems', 'Markets Media', 'LCH', 'CME', 'Eurex', 'SGX', 'Willkie Farr & Gallagher', 'Baton', 'Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'Willkie Farr & Gallagher', 'Digital', '. central bank', 'Baton', 'LCH', 'LCH', 'Baton Systems', 'LCH', 'Baton', 'Baton Systems', 'batonsystems', 'LCH', 'LCH', 'Baton', 'CCP', 'J.P.

Mr Blythe welcomed new member Boyd Winston (JP Morgan) who will be replacing Jason Flynn, and guest presenters Cameron Lyle (Bank of England), Umang Sinha (Bank of England) and Yvonne Deane (UK Finance).Mr Blythe announced that David Broadway would be stepping down from the Committee.Item 2 - Minutes of the 12 November meetingThe minutes of the 12 November 2020 meeting were agreed. There were no matters arising.Item 3 - FXJSC Turnover Survey ResultsCameron Lyle and Umang Sinha (Bank of England) delivered a presentation on the October 2020 FXJSC Turnover Survey resultsfootnote [1]. Average daily reported UK FX turnover had increased by 7% since April 2020 to $2.6 trillion, but there was a 10% year on year decrease on the all-time high figures reported in October 2019. A positive six month change was seen across almost all products with an 11% increase in FX swap turnover. It was also noted that there was a reversal in the trend of FX spot activity, having declined for the three previous reporting periods, which rose 4%.Record highs were seen in USD/CNY in October, with turnover rising 56% since April 2020 and 43% year-on-year. These increases were largely driven by FX Spot and FX Options trades, with turnover in each up 73% and 266% respectively since April 2020. Members commented that this increase is likely correlated with China's increasing internationalisation, which is expected to continue in the future.Sterling activity rose significantly from April 2020 to October 2020, with GBP/USD overtaking USD/JPY as the second most widely traded currency pair in London. USD/EUR remained the most traded currency pair. Members commented that the end of the UK EU Transition period was likely a key driving factor in high sterling turnover.The proportion of turnover transacted via Interdealer Direct fell from 23% to 21% and this fall was concentrated in FX swaps. Turnover conducted via Electronic Trading systems increased from 22% to 24%. While Customer Direct saw a relatively steep fall, retracing gains seen in the last survey, voice broker turnover increased from 16% to 19%.The number of trades fell 9% relative to April 2020 and average daily trade size increased by 18%. It was noted that one potential driver was seen to be increasing volumes of FX swap trading, given that FX swaps are often traded in relatively large ticket sizes. It was also noted that the gradual decrease in volumes of spot FX may have led to the fall in the average number of trades.In terms of global activity, London accounted for 54% of global turnover, a slight dip since the April 2020 results, down by 1%, with a 4% fall year on year.Item 4 - Brexit Trade DealsYvonne Deane (UK Finance) presented an update on Brexit Trade Deals from a UK Finance perspective. Ms Deane noted that while Brexit was officially 31 January 2020, the transition period muted any immediate changes until 1 January 2021 when the UK access to the European financial regulatory framework for cross-border services ended - and vice versa. Over the last days of December 2020 it was noted there had been a flurry of activity to agree the Trade and Cooperation Agreementfootnote [2] ('the Deal'), although it was noted that this deal was seen to be 'light' on financial services.UK Finance stated members did not report significant market volatility. Ms Deane outlined other impacts identified on markets and trading, specifically Share Trading Obligation (STO) and Derivatives Trading Obligation (DTO), central counterparties and central securities depositories, and Central Securities Depositories Regulation.Members discussed the road ahead post-Brexit and how the UK will shape its future relationship with the European Union as well as strengthen its relationship with other key markets.Members also discussed how, from an operational perspective, the UK's exit from the European Union and the subsequent transition period was a smooth process; it was noted that this was likely a result of extensive preparations by the market.Item 5 - FX Settlement Crisis Playbook UpdateJon Goddard (BNY Mellon) provided an update on the progress of the FX Settlement Crisis Playbook ('the Playbook'). Mr Goddard recapped on the origins of the Playbook, noting that it was produced in response to the Sector Desktop Exercise held by the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group (CMORG) in January 2015. The Playbook sets out various strategies, trigger points, operating principles as well as common and unilateral options for recovery and re-start of FX settlements following a FX settlement crisis caused by the unavailability of a critical vendor. It was noted that while the Playbook provides a range of relevant options in crisis, underpinned by core planning details, rather than a set of prescriptive rules, it could still be used by firms and supplement existing risk management procedures. Mr Goddard explained that the Playbook has undergone a number of reviews and an overview of it was recently presented to the FXJSC Legal Sub Committee.Mr Goddard highlighted that there was still an outstanding question regarding the future of the Playbook, how it is used, shared and published. Members discussed how relevant the Playbook would be in current times, being created before the implementation of the FX Global Code ('the Code') and the Covid-19 pandemic. It was noted that the Playbook may be a good foundation to build on, as members discussed whether it could be further linked to the principles of the Code or upcoming regulation on operational resilience which includes the planning of severe but plausible scenarios.Item 6 - GFXC UpdateDavid Edmunds (FXJSC Secretariat, Bank of England) updated members on key topics discussed at the GFXC meeting on 8 December 2020 and the progress of the three-year review. Discussion at the meeting focused on the GFXC's three-year review of the FX Global Code and centred on initial feedback on proposals from the GFXC's working groups, across five areas: Disclosures; Anonymous Trading; Algos & TCA; Execution Principles; and Settlement Risk.Mr Edmunds noted that feedback on the working group proposals had been incorporated into the final draft of the papers, which are due to be discussed at the March GFXC meeting. There will be a final opportunity for Committee members to comment on the proposals and provide feedback ahead of the proposals being publicised for public feedback in April - May, with a view for the GFXC to conclude the 3-year review at its June meeting.Committee members were invited to provide written comments on the GFXC papers. An aggregated summary would be provided to the GFXC Secretariat ahead of the 29 March meeting.Item 7 - Deutsche Bank Operations OverviewAdam Jukes (Deutsche Bank) provided committee members with an overview of Deutsche Bank's operational structure from an educational perspective.Mr Jukes noted that Deutsche Bank's Chief Operating Office (COO) divisional structure is broken down into six primary areas which correlate with the company's executive committee: 1. CB, IB & CRU Operations (Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Capital Release Unit); 2. CB IB & CRU KYC Operations and DBIS (DB Investment Services); 3. Corporate Services; 4. Divisional Control and Risk Office; 5. Central Functions; and 6. COO Americas.Mr Jukes presented an overview of Deutsche Bank's Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) Operations team, which is part of CB, IB & CRU Operations, which covers products including foreign exchange, rates derivatives credit derivatives, listed derivatives, and e-commerce. It was highlighted that this area covers functions including Derivatives Settlement & Confirmations, Middle Office and Fixed Income Securities processing. It was noted that there is a three-way matrix from a Management & Oversight perspective:: 1: Global Product Leads, generally based in London, with responsibility for ensuring front-to-back oversight for the product area and maintaining primary relationships with Trading & Sales and other infrastructure functions for that business; 2: Cross-Asset Functional Leads in offshore teams, who are responsible for the teams managing the day-to-day processing of the Operations functions; and 3) Regional Cross-Product Leads around the globe providing benefits from a local Business and Regulatory standpoint. Regional coverage included the Americas, Asia-Pacific, India, Germany and UK & Ireland. These Product, Functional and Regional Leads all report into the Global Head of FIC Operations.It was noted that Deutsche Bank Operations has a large overseas presence, particularly in India and Manila. Mr Jukes explained that one benefit from having distributed locations is the increased resiliency that comes with it and noted that, while there were some initial challenges, he believes this setup has worked well for DB FIC Operations throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.Item 8 - CLS UpdateJohn Hagon (CLS) updated members on CLS Convergence Project progress, highlighting that most members should have completed or be going through regression and scripted testing with an expectation that CLS will migrate its settlement service to the new platform in the first half of 2021, subject to board and regulatory approval.Mr Hagon noted in relation to ClearedFX, that Eurex plans to go-live on 22 March with three clearing members, subject to an internal and regulatory approval process. CLSNow activity has been low and banks have been slow to adopt the service, likely due to reprioritisation. CLSNet was migrated to the cloud over the weekend, now segmented from the rest of the CLS settlement estate.CLS had recently undertaken an exercise in collaboration with a global bank Settlement Member (SM), to get a better understanding of how FX trades are settled in CLS eligible currencies and a deeper understanding of what is influencing non-PvP (Payment Versus Payment) settlement. CLS plans to share the preliminary results at the upcoming GFXC meeting and to complete analysis with an additional two members in 2021.Item 9 - SWIFT UpdateJoe Halberstadt (SWIFT) noted that the SWIFT board had recently met to approve six changes for 2021, two of which were new changes and four which were originally postponed from 2020. The most significant change noted was tightened party fields of MT300 series messages for options and commodities, as well as the addition of a new UTI reference code for derivative trades executed in the UK.Mr Halberstadt highlighted that the industry would need to consider the impact of trades using digital coins and to what extent these trades need to be confirmed, and whether these coins will need to be treated as currency or commodities.Item 10 - Education & Outreachi. UK Finance UpdateAndrew Rogan (UK Finance) updated members on recent discussions with the Bank of England on the operational resilience policy statements due to be released at the end of March. It was stated that while firms will be expected to evidence that work is underway to implement the policy outlined in the statements at the end of the first 12 months, they will be taking a more liberal view in allowing firms time to build their processes and learn from the statements, giving them additional time to deal with issues.Mr Rogan noted that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had requested UK Finance to organise a webinar on these statements closer to the publication date. Mr Rogan will forward the details of this webinar and any additional information to the FXJSC Secretariat to share with committee members.ii. ECB OMGSteve Forrest (UBS) provided members with an overview of the topics discussed by the European Central Bank (ECB) Operations Managers Group (OMG) at the December meeting. Agenda items included: update on the T2S consolidation project; discussion on the Target2 payment outage on 23 November 2020; update on regulatory changes on benchmarks; draft revisions to the FX Global Code; update from members on current Covid-19 impacts; and a review of the 2021 work program.iii. GFXD UpdateMr Forrest provided an overview of topics discussed by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) Global Foreign Exchange Division (GFXD) February meeting. Topics on the agenda included: an update from the settlements working group on types of transactions not covered by CLS; and an update on the confirmations working group looking at vendor outreach on platforms and where matching can be improved.Mr Forrest also noted a discussion related to liquidity management in emerging market currencies was had, and what could be learnt from the Turkish Lira incident.Item 11 - Any Other BusinessThe FXJSC Secretariat noted that a 2021 forward agenda had been drafted for the Committee, based on feedback received by members, and would circulate to members for additional comments after the meeting.Next FXJSC Meeting: 9 June 2021",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.15,0.2,0.65,True,English,"['FXJSC', 'Goldman Sachs', 'FXJSC Operations Sub-committee', 'JP Morgan', 'Bank of England', 'Bank of England', 'UK Finance', 'FXJSC', 'Bank of England', 'EU', 'Interdealer Direct', 'Customer Direct', 'UK Finance', 'Finance', 'European Union', 'European Union', 'BNY Mellon', 'Cross Market Operational Resilience Group', 'CMORG']","['London FXJSC Operations Sub-Committee Meeting', 'Minutes', '3 March', 'Cross Market Operational Resilience Group', 'October 2020 FXJSC Turnover Survey resultsfootnote', 'new member Boyd Winston', 'positive six month change', 'three previous reporting periods', 'existing risk management pro', 'FXJSC Operations Sub-committee meeting', 'FX Settlement Crisis Playbook Update', 'Central Securities Depositories Regulation', 'European financial regulatory framework', 'UK EU Transition period', 'average daily trade size', 'UK Finance stated members', 'key driving factor', 'one potential driver', 'large ticket sizes', 'significant market volatility', 'subsequent transition period', 'Sector Desktop Exercise', 'core planning details', 'Electronic Trading systems', 'Share Trading Obligation', 'Derivatives Trading Obligation', 'voice broker turnover', 'FX swap trading', 'FX swap turnover', 'time high figures', 'high sterling turnover', 'Brexit Trade Deals', 'UK FX turnover', 'UK Finance perspective', 'other key markets', 'FX spot activity', 'FX Options trades', 'operational perspective', 'last survey', 'spot FX', 'financial services', 'central counterparties', 'FX swaps', 'FX settlements', '12 November meeting', '12 November 2020 meeting', 'European Union', 'Sterling activity', 'other impacts', 'global turnover', 'UK access', 'The Playbook', 'unilateral options', 'relevant options', 'April 2020 results', 'average number', 'John Blythe', 'Goldman Sachs', 'conference call', 'Mr Blythe', 'JP Morgan', 'Jason Flynn', 'guest presenters', 'Umang Sinha', 'Yvonne Deane', 'David Broadway', 'Record highs', 'increasing internationalisation', 'currency pair', 'Interdealer Direct', 'Customer Direct', 'retracing gains', 'global activity', 'slight dip', 'Ms Deane', 'immediate changes', 'cross-border services', 'last days', 'Cooperation Agreementfootnote', 'smooth process', 'extensive preparations', 'Jon Goddard', 'BNY Mellon', 'Mr Goddard', 'various strategies', 'operating principles', 'critical vendor', 'prescriptive rules', 'increasing volumes', 'gradual decrease', 'Cameron Lyle', 'future relationship', 'Minutes', '2pm', '5pm', 'March', 'Location', 'Teleconference', 'Item', 'Welcome', 'Apologies', 'Chair', 'Bank', 'England', 'matters', 'presentation', 'year', 'products', '11% increase', 'reversal', 'trend', 'USD/CNY', 'increases', 'China', 'GBP/USD', 'USD/JPY', 'London', 'proportion', 'fall', 'terms', '1 January', 'December', 'flurry', 'DTO', 'progress', 'origins', 'response', 'CMORG', 'points', 'common', 'recovery', 'unavailability', 'range', 'firms']",2021-06-15,marketscreener.com,EUREX

Meng has said she is innocent.Lawyers for Huawei and HSBC in Hong Kong agreed to a release of the documents in April to Meng’s legal team on the condition that they “use reasonable effort” to keep confidential information concealed from the public, according to submissions filed by the defense on Friday.Prosecutors representing the Canadian government argued against the ban, saying in submissions filed the same day that ""to be consistent with the open court principle, a ban must be tailored"" and details should be selectively redacted from the public, rather than the whole documents.A consortium of media outlets, including Reuters News, also opposes the ban.The open court principle requires that court proceedings be open and accessible to the public and to the media.It is unclear what documents Huawei obtained from HSBC, but defense lawyers argue they are relevant to Meng's case.Meng’s hearing was initially set to wrap up in May but Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes granted an extension to allow the defense to read through the new documents.Hearings in the extradition case are scheduled to finish in late August.Reporting by Moira Warburton in Vancouver; Editing by Howard GollerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.0,0.61,0.39,mixed,0.07,0.08,0.85,True,English,,"['extradition', 'case', 'huawei', 'team', 'court', 'seeks', 'open', 'publication', 'meng', 'ban', 'public', 'documents', 'cfo', 'legal', 'vancouver', 'hsbc']",2021-06-14,reuters.com,EUREX

Punitive new proposals from the standard-setting body may ensure bitcoin remains in the fringes of regulated finance. Yet safer areas of the blockchain and crypto world are still accessible to JPMorgan (JPM.N), HSBC (HSBA.L) and others. It’s a good balance between prudence and progress.The Switzerland-based team of bank supervisors, chaired by Spanish rate-setter Pablo Hernández de Cos, designs international standards which local watchdogs implement. Thursday’s consultation paper comes down hard on high-profile assets like bitcoin and ethereum.The two most popular cryptocurrencies fall into the Basel Committee’s Group 2 designation, reserved for assets whose value fluctuates wildly or whose key participants could be untraceable and unregulated. That means a trading position or loan denominated in bitcoin would be subject to a 1,250% risk weighting. So, a $100 million asset would appear as $1.25 billion on the bank’s balance sheet, forcing a lender with an 8% capital ratio to hold $100 million of corresponding equity.Such a harsh treatment will make it uneconomic for big banks to facilitate bitcoin trades in the way they handle bonds or currencies. Lending to clients who want to buy or sell short the asset would face similar penalties. Hedge funds, companies and other crypto-curious counterparties will have to stick with industry specialists like $47 billion Coinbase Global (COIN.O).The proposals go easier on more humdrum areas of crypto. Basel’s Group 1 designation covers tokenised assets, such as a conventional bond where ownership is recorded on a decentralised register. As long as the underlying risks and ownership rights are the same, the standard-setters see no reason to massively increase capital requirements. The treatment of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a steadier asset like the U.S. dollar, depends on the strength of the underlying claims.That gives lenders permission to experiment with crypto’s underlying innovations without piling into volatile bitcoin. Bankers may fear missing out, but the sector is still young. The combined value of the 10 biggest cryptocurrencies is $1.3 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. JPMorgan’s balance sheet alone is about three times as large. Supervisors are wisely ensuring that cryptocurrencies will remain largely outside the regulated banking system, at least in their current form.Follow liamwardproud on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- Banks must set aside enough capital to cover losses on any bitcoin holdings in full, global regulators at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed on June 10.- The Switzerland-based body, which sets international standards that are then implemented by local watchdogs, advocated a twin approach to capital requirements for crypto assets.- The first part covers so-called tokenised assets, where the ownership of traditional securities like bonds is recorded through a distributed network of computers or secured through cryptography and other similar techniques.- Those assets could be subject to a similar capital requirement as the underlying financial products, with “add-ons” to account for the risk of unanticipated technological problems.- The second group includes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which would be subject to a new ""conservative prudential treatment"" with a risk-weighting of 1,250% for the purposes of calculating capital requirements because of their ""unique risks"".- The consultation concludes on Sept. 10.SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href="""" target=""_blank""></a> | Editing by Peter Thal Larsen and Karen Kwok",neutral,0.02,0.86,0.12,mixed,0.28,0.08,0.64,True,English,,"['subject', 'blockchain', 'push', 'assets', 'fringe', 'cryptocurrencies', 'bitcoin', 'similar', 'underlying', 'requirements', 'rules', 'value', 'bank', 'capital', 'treatment']",2021-06-10,reuters.com,EUREX

Photograph: The Scout AssociationContactless, digital and mobile banking – plus more than a year of lockdowns and online shopping – mean some children have little or no experience of seeing money physically change hands.The badge is designed to help them understand “in-app” purchases, and the way money works online and in shops, and to make decisions about their spending.Amy Butterworth, programme design manager at the Scout Association, says: “When people think about the scouts, they often think about camping and hiking … but in order to get there, we need to have the budget to do it.”She says these skills are particularly important following the pandemic, when “young people are going to be hit in a way we [can’t] yet predict”.Activities that cubs and beavers can take part in include budgeting for a camp meal. As well learning how much items cost, and considering how to divide up their money, the members are also encouraged to think about the impact of their spending, and what happens if they buy Fairtrade or organic foods.In another activity, beavers have to imagine they are packing their bag for a hike – while they might have lots of things they want to take, they have limited space and have to decide between them what they need and want, just like when there’s limited cash.20th Edmonton Beavers learn about traditional money Photograph: Dave Bird/The Scout AssociationLouise Azavedo of 20th Edmonton has been setting the tasks for the cubs, who are aged between eight and 10-and-a-half, and beavers, who are younger, at six to eight years old.The beavers have sorted plastic coins and tried to identify notes from around the world.“They’re going to design their own coins and banknotes which they will present next week – it’s called the scout pound, and they’ll be able to use it to buy things as part of a game,” she says.The badge, which is sponsored by HSBC, was developed with young people, parents and scout volunteers, and has been designed to be accessible even to children who are still grappling to grasp maths.Stuart Haire, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UK, says: “The Covid-19 crisis has tested the financial resilience of many families as well as disrupted in-classroom learning, elevating the need for more flexible and effective financial education resources to help young people build financial capabilities for a changing world.“Creating new and interesting ways for young people to engage with financial literacy is key, and we’re thrilled to be working with the scouts to launch their money skills activity badge – the first financial skill-building programme of its kind.”The badge, which shows a world with a piggy-bank-style slot together with cash and a card, is one of many activity badges that beavers and cubs can earn by learning skills and completing tasks, either at meetings or at home.Guides can earn a similar Saver badge.",neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,mixed,0.25,0.18,0.57,True,English,,"['cubs', 'savings', 'financial', 'beavers', 'badge', 'skills', 'money', 'bitcoin', 'scout', 'activity', 'edmonton', 'young', 'launch']",2021-06-16,amp.theguardian.com,EUREX

Photo by VnExpress/Quynh Tran.HSBC has advised Vietnam to be cautious about provision of credits for its property market, considering it fraught with risk.The bank says caution is needed despite the sector making an important contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).In its regular June report, the HSBC notes that property prices, especially in the luxury segment in Vietnam’s big cities, have increased over the past two years.Last year, prices of luxury apartments climbed up 9 percent year-on-year, while those in the affordable and mid-end segments rose 4-5 percent.The market share of high-end and luxury segments, meanwhile, surged to over 70 percent in 2020 from below 30 percent in 2019.Although foreign direct investment in Vietnam’s real estate market in May soared by over 200 percent against the same period last year, most of the capital was still focused on production. The HSBC deduced that property prices rose mainly due to domestic investors.As it had happened in many other nations, this was the result of loosened monetary policies that created favorable conditions for lowering interest rates and increasing liquidity.Credit growth in the Vietnamese property sector rose 15 percent in January and February over the same period last year, surpassing the target of 12 percent set by the State Bank of Vietnam, the country’s central bank. As of mid-April, the credit growth stood at more than 15 percent.In mid-April, the central bank called on commercial banks to strengthen risk control, announcing that it would tighten control over credit for sectors with potential risks, including the property sector.According to the HSBC report, the central bank can take stricter control measures if needed.

NOT sure what switching could do for you? Here's what you need to know: Switching is easy. Under the switching service, swapping banks should take seven working days. That includes all your payments, direct debits and standing orders being moved too. Just open your new account and then ask your new provider to close your old account using the switch service. Make sure you are eligible. Most accounts have certain requirements, such as paying in a minimum amount of cash each month. Watch your overdraft. Check your new bank will offer you the same limit — and does not have higher costs for using it.Payments like direct debits are transferred too. You won't have to arrange them all again.You just need to tell the new bank you want to open an account and close your old one using the switching service.Beware that if you just open the account and close the old one yourself, you won't be eligible for the bonus - you need to use the switching service.Halifax was until recently offering £100 to switch, but that ended in May.And First Direct has previously pulled the bonus for a period of time before its availability now.It's always worth keeping an eye out for the bonuses that are on offer as they can come and go as well as increase, just like this First Direct one.Virgin Money is offering a bonus too, and it's perfect for wine-lovers -instead of cash, you'll get 12 bottles of the tipple worth £138.Most read in Money HOUSE THAT Martin Lewis warns homeowners to check mortgage deals NOW as rates plummet FAN OF IT What’s cheaper to run a fan or air con as millions of Brits face 28C heat IN OUR PRIME Amazon Prime Day 2021: When is it and what deals will be on?

Overall though, the short-term outlook will likely continue to be that spot remains in the recent range of 1.20-1.24 and measures of volatility are also coming lower too. The next focus for spot will turn to FOMC and PMIs which do have the scope to take spot to end-point of these intervals (in both directions). Looking ahead, we continue to expect EUR/USD to move towards 1.15 in 12m.”“President Lagarde presented a more optimistic economic outlook given the progress on the vaccination campaign and substantial additional fiscal policy measures (NGEU and US packages). Both the growth and inflation projections for 2021 and 2022 were revised up significantly, accompanied by higher core inflation forecasts. ECB expects a further acceleration in economic activity in H2 21 on the back of a pick-up in consumer spending, strong global demand and accommodative fiscal and monetary policies.

We had many who would like to have participated, but the complexity involved in doing this for the first time was a bit too much for a first-time investor in a social bond,” he said.Alecta revealed yesterday that it was investing $100m in the new blended finance social bond called “Financing For Healthier Lives”, with proceeds aimed at health, financial inclusion and renewable energy and other types of project in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.Swedish company AFA Insurance is taking up the remaining $52.5m of the listed issue.The asset manager is responsAbility, and Sida, Sweden’s government agency for development cooperation, has guaranteed the first 25% of any losses.Hökfelt said he believed it was the first time the agency had guaranteed in a bond packaged in this way.“We needed something that was investable, a solid investment where you get a good risk-adjusted return,” he said.“The interest for that is huge in Sweden, but you also need to be able to package it in ways so it fits the investors’ policy, and their mandate also has to be configured so that it suits, and there also needs to be a portfolio where it fits in,” he said.Normally, Hökfelt said, this kind of financial structure would be higher risk but also higher return.Danske Bank wants to make this type of bond investable for a broader range of investors, according to Hökfelt. While this bond was specifically targeted at Swedish investors, he said that in its next steps, the bank would be going to Nordic investors more broadly.“It’s a question of finding the right place for the investors for this, and that might take a little bit of time for them,” he said.Impact investment was “a necessity” these days, he said, with the world in the state it was.“Whether you look at poverty or health – it is impact investments that the world needs, so of course that is what we need to look at,” he said.The two investors in the bond had contributed a lot to its creation, Hökfelt said.“AFA and Alecta have throughout the process, with their expertise and knowledge, been able to guide us to some extent in finding the format where they get the risk-adjusted return they want.“Sida has enabled the risk to be manageable for the investors, and then responsAbility has been vital, having the impact expertise that they do,” he said.Looking for IPE’s latest magazine?

That kicks off a program of issuance that could top 80 billion euros this year and end up posing as a rival haven asset to U.S. Treasuries.“International investors are very happy with these bonds coming out of Europe,” Klaus Regling, managing director at the European Stability Mechanism, told Bloomberg TV. “People are happy with how Europe has reacted to the crisis and how the euro area is developing.”The sale is one of the most highly-anticipated in recent times, given the huge amount of debt that the EU plans to issue. Before the pandemic, pooling European debt would have been a near-impossible feat as it faced resistance from the region’s richer countries, with the move now creating greater investor confidence in the bloc’s integration.Its social-bond program in the past year has already proved a big hit with investors, though demand slowed for later sales. The prospect of the NextGenerationEU program has itself been a boon for borrowing costs across the region, narrowing the premium faced by riskier debt issuers like Greece and Italy.Two more sales are set to come by the end of July, and the first green bonds may start as early as autumn. The EU also plans to issue bonds via auction, as well as sell short-dated bills as part of its plans to become a fully-fledged debt issuer.“The Commission took advantage of the huge demand,” said ABN strategist Floortje Merten. “Two more syndicated deals to follow before August, they don’t have so much time before demand becomes more muted due to summer holidays, so perhaps that also explains the big size issued today.”The lead managers for the sale were Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA, with bookrunners including BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley. The EU excluded 10 of the heaviest-hitting banks in the debt market, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., over historic breaches of antitrust rules, according to the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter.Europe is emerging from the pandemic as the speed of vaccine distribution ramps up. That’s seen bets mount for a rapid economic recovery this year, but also inflation, a scourge for bond investors. The European Central Bank is expected to announce a winding down of its pandemic purchase program in September, having held off from making the decision last week.Banks highlighted the relative cheapness of the bond when the EU opened orderbooks on Monday, which is often used as a way for issuers to entice investors into buying up a new security. The pricing was set at two basis points below midswaps, a tightening from the initial price thoughts Monday.“It is just flying,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. “They have done the safe choice of doing a 10-year bond and giving a decent new issue premium.”EuropeEight issuers have brought eight tranches to market so far today, giving a minimum volume of 23 billion euros including the EU sale.In sovereigns, Germany sold 4.068 billion euros of bonds due Jun 16, 2023 in an auction, with order books covered 1.19 timesPublic sector issuer AfDB is also marketing a GBP benchmark 5Y, while a flurry of financials -- including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and La Banque Postale -- are readying fresh dealsElsewhere, Deutsche Bank is set to rake in $1 billion on trader Mark Spehn’s shipping bet The distressed-debt trader wagered under $100 million on bonds and bank loans of Zim Integrated Shipping Services that were trading at a heavy discount; those investments have now surged and could effectively hand Deutsche Bank a win that would be equal to about a quarter of its 2020 investment banking profit Read more: Deutsche Bank Set to Reap $1 Billion on Trader’s Freight Bet (1)AsiaTwo Australian banks and a Chinese real estate firm kept activity in Asia’s primary dollar bond market ticking ahead of this week’s Fed meeting.Macquarie Group starts building books for its three-part bond Tuesday, while ANZ Banking Group’s unit in New Zealand looks to price a dollar offering.

That kicks off a programme of issuance that could top €80 billion this year and end up posing as a rival haven asset to US Treasuries.""International investors are very happy with these bonds coming out of Europe,"" Klaus Regling, managing director at the European Stability Mechanism, told Bloomberg TV. ""People are happy with how Europe has reacted to the crisis and how the euro area is developing.""The sale is one of the most highly anticipated in recent times, given the huge amount of debt that the EU plans to issue.

The EU also plans to issue bonds via auction, as well as sell short-dated bills as part of its plans to become a fully fledged debt issuer.""The Commission took advantage of the huge demand,"" said ABN strategist Floortje Merten. ""Two more syndicated deals to follow before August, they don't have so much time before demand becomes more muted due to summer holidays, so perhaps that also explains the big size issued today.""The lead managers for the sale were Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA, with bookrunners including BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings plc, and Morgan Stanley.

Danske Bank,2,PyNews API,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/biden-spending-china-price-controls-inflation-by-isabella-m-weber-2021-06,Will China Save the US from Inflation Fears? by Isabella M. Weber,"And, in 2021, commodity prices have soared, triggered by supply-side bottlenecks and the global economic recovery.These commodity price rises have stoked fear of inflation.During WWII the US had reverted to comprehensive price controls after the initial attempts to contain inflation with partial controls failed.So, when economists warned in the 1980s that sudden withdrawal of price controls in China would lead to runaway inflation, China’s leaders listened.In the urban economy, China repurposed the existing institutions of the planned economy into market creators and participants in core sectors.","The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta warned last month that the US might be headed toward an inflationary episode on par with the period following World War II, when the release of pent-up demand fueled a 20% surge in prices. But China's efforts to stabilize commodity prices should help to avoid a worst-case scenario.AMHERST – The fiscal expansion in the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is like nothing seen outside of wartime. Further large-scale public spending will be needed to rebuild needed infrastructure, tackle climate change, and create jobs. But some prominent economists are warning that government spending on such an extraordinary scale could fuel accelerating price growth and cause inflation expectations to become unanchored.For more than three decades, expectations of moderate price growth in the US and other advanced economies have been sustained – not least by China’s integration into the global economy. Might China come to the rescue as the Biden administration seeks to open the fiscal floodgates?There are certainly reasons to be wary of price risks. At the core of Biden’s initiative are infrastructure investments, which require materials such as steel and copper. And, in 2021, commodity prices have soared, triggered by supply-side bottlenecks and the global economic recovery.These commodity price rises have stoked fear of inflation. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, for example, warned last month that the US might be headed toward an inflationary episode on par with the years after World War II, when the release of pent-up demand fueled a 20% surge in prices.Enter China. Late last month, the country’s government announced that it would strengthen targeted efforts to bring down the prices of iron ore, copper, steel, and other major commodities that had pushed China’s consumer prices to a 12-year high. The government’s initiative to halt the rise in commodity prices is bound to also help contain the prices of a wide range of durable consumer goods that countries like the US import from China. As Keith Bradsher put it, China’s attempt to tame inflation matters for the globe. As Danske Bank Chief Economist Michael Grahn observed, this puts a “dent” in the “‘inflation is coming’ narrative.”In fact, stabilization of prices of strategic commodities has played a major role in enabling China to achieve rapid economic growth without inflation. And yet, it was not always clear that China’s government would take such a hands-on approach to economic management.Back to Health: Making Up for Lost Time Back to Health: Making Up for Lost Time The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare systemic inequities that will have to be addressed if we are ever going to build more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive societies. Join us on June 23, 2021, for our latest live virtual event, Back to Health: Making Up for Lost Time, where leading experts will examine the immediate legacy of the pandemic and explore solutions for bringing all communities and societies back to health. REGISTER NOWAs I show in How China Escaped Shock Therapy, during the early years of Deng Xiaoping’s policy of “reform and opening up,” many argued that China should embrace “shock therapy” – kicked off by abrupt and comprehensive price deregulation (in order to reset relative prices) followed by large-scale privatization and total trade liberalization. After all, they noted, West Germany implemented overnight price liberalizations after WWII, to great success. Western free-market economists, such as Milton Friedman, strongly supported this approach.China took this advice seriously. On two separate occasions in the 1980s, it nearly implemented the first step of shock therapy. In 1988, China came to the brink of a Big Bang, unleashing a short inflationary spurt that helped prepare the ground for the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Ultimately, the Chinese leadership refrained from a sudden price liberalization. It did not want to make the same mistake the US had after WWII.During WWII the US had reverted to comprehensive price controls after the initial attempts to contain inflation with partial controls failed. After the war, the question was, what to do about prices.In 1946, 54 economists – including 11 former presidents of the American Economic Association and distinguished figures like Paul Samuelson and Irving Fisher – published an open letter advocating the gradual release of price controls. With “unprecedented” levels of demand, they cautioned, “the supply of raw materials and consumer goods” would be “inadequate to stave off a serious inflation in the next year, unless price control is continued without crippling amendments.” Such controls should be removed only when “supply and demand of any important commodity” are “more in balance at ceiling prices.”President Harry S. Truman withdrew price controls anyway. And, as the Atlanta Fed’s recent report reminded us, inflation soared, devaluing savings. So, when economists warned in the 1980s that sudden withdrawal of price controls in China would lead to runaway inflation, China’s leaders listened.The approach they pursued instead emerged from China’s agricultural reforms. Initially, output quotas and prices were left unchanged, but responsibility for production was shifted from communes to households. If households managed to produce more than their designated share, they could sell the excess at market prices.In the urban economy, China repurposed the existing institutions of the planned economy into market creators and participants in core sectors. This allowed the Chinese state to continue to steer individual sectors, even as it largely relinquished its direct control over the economy in the 1980s and 1990s and engaged in wide-ranging privatizations.Today, China has largely withdrawn direct price controls. But the government continues to intervene in goods markets when it deems it necessary to stabilize specific prices, mainly through policies that increase supply or by cracking down on hoarding and speculation. A Price Department exists to this day at the National Development and Reform Commission. In the current context, it has assumed renewed relevance.The Biden administration is working toward a New Deal-type reconstruction, and some rightly advocate a National Investment Authority, modeled after the Reconstruction Finance Corporation established in 1932. But when it comes to the lessons of the past, the price stabilization policies that accompanied war-scale spending have so far received little consideration in the US policy debate. China’s initiative to crack down on the prices that have fueled inflation fears in the US might help counter hawkish sentiment and prepare the ground for Biden’s public investment push.",positive,0.55,0.02,0.43,mixed,0.11,0.03,0.86,True,English,,"['health', 'chinas', 'isabella', 'economists', 'weber', 'm', 'controls', 'economy', 'prices', 'fears', 'china', 'save', 'price', 'commodity', 'inflation']",2021-06-10,project-syndicate.org,EUREX

That is equivalent to a yield of about 0.10% according to Reuters calculations.The bond will raise 10 billion euros, France's junior minister for European affairs said on May 31.The EU has said it expects to issue 80 billion euros of long-term debt this year.After the inaugural deal, the EU will sell two more bonds via syndication - where a borrower hires banks to sell the debt directly to end investors - by the end of July.The EU will then launch a bill programme for short-dated borrowing that will be placed from September via auction, the more common way governments raise debt.The bloc hired BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo and Morgan Stanley as joint lead managers for the debut deal earlier on Monday, while Danske Bank and Santander will act as co-lead managers, according to an earlier memo.(Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe, Steve Orlofsky and Mark Heinrich)",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.04,0.14,0.82,True,English,,"['european', 'deal', 'backing', 'billion', 'eu', 'euros', 'bond', 'according', 'starts', 'lead', 'sale', 'recovery', 'investors', 'fund', 'debt']",2021-06-14,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

Such a late date would leave little room for manoeuvre should the candidate fall through.Story continuesIf the men remain the frontrunners, it may also spark questions about lack of diversity as Deutsche seeks to install more female leaders. [nL2N2NJ0F6]German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer was the preferred candidate, the three people said.Weimer, however, has publicly dismissed the idea saying earlier this year that his taking the post was ""not at all a topic of discussion"". A spokesperson for Weimer declined to comment further.It is unclear whether Weimer could change his mind. His contract as CEO of Deutsche Boerse was extended last year to 2024. Regulators would not approve his keeping both posts, the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.Furthermore, accepting the position at Deutsche Bank would require him to resign from a job that paid him 6 million euros last year - a multiple of Achleitner's earnings.Also in the running, the three people said, are Norbert Winkeljohann, an accountant and chair of Bayer, and Frank Witter, a new board member who was until recently Volkswagen's finance chief.Winkeljohann did not respond to a request for comment and Witter declined to comment.Achleitner has privately sought to reassure investors that the search is underway. In recent weeks, he told investors that the new chair's name will very likely begin with the letter 'W', according to one person with knowledge of the matter.But the vague nature of his plans has left regulators, and some investors, frustrated.""The quicker we have clarity over a successor the better,"" said Vanda Rothacker of Union Investment, a shareholder in the group.Regulators have struggled for years to rein in Deutsche Bank following numerous scandals and governance issues.The U.S. Department of Justice has investigated the lender's role -deutsche-bank-money-laundering-exclus-idUSKBN1Y60ED in the 200 billion euro ($220 billion) Danske Bank money laundering scandal, people familiar with the inquiry have told Reuters.Deutsche has also had to pay nearly $700 million in fines by U.S. and British regulators in a separate money laundering case involving $10 billion in so-called mirror trades from Russia.The bank has said it has significantly improved controls in recent years.Earlier this year, the ECB clashed with CEO Christian Sewing, demanding he relinquish day-to-day oversight of Deutsche's sprawling investment bank, fearing he had too much on his plate.Sewing, who eventually complied, for his part has sharply criticised the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy that has required lenders to pay to deposit money with the central bank and eroded profits.(Editing by John O'Donnell, Kirsten Donovan)",neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,mixed,0.11,0.09,0.8,True,English,,"['ecb', 'knowledge', 'lenders', 'chairman', 'regulators', 'recent', 'sources', 'deutsche', 'tells', 'fast', 'successor', 'money', 'laundering', 'bank', 'exclusive', 'weimer']",2021-06-11,news.yahoo.com,EUREX

The central bank in Oslo will probably keep its deposit rate at zero on Thursday, but economists are awaiting signals for an increase on Sept. 23, or even sooner.Norwegian officials already hinted a year ago that they would begin withdrawing stimulus sooner than in other major currency jurisdictions. With the government using the country’s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund -- the world’s biggest -- to aid the economy, the central bank hasn’t had to resort to unconventional tools such as negative rates.Anticipation of a September rate increase means that speculation for a second hike in December is already building, stoked by an improvement in Norges Bank’s Regional Network report, a key quarterly gauge of economic activity.Registered unemployment rate fell to 3.5% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, below the central bank’s forecast, bolstering views of two hikes by year-end at Danske Bank and Nordea Bank, among others. Governor Oystein Olsen said in March it would take 2-3 years to achieve a “normal” policy rate level of between 1.25-1.5%.While core inflation dropped more than analysts expected last month, the central bank is expected to look through weak price growth driven by the appreciation of the krone.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“We previously forecast liftoff in December, but we have now brought that forward to September. A decline in infections and progress on the government’s vaccination program has allowed for two easing steps in virus measures since mid-April.”--Johanna Jeansson, economist. Click here for the full previewWhile Norway has ceased offering AstraZeneca Plc vaccinations and has effectively sidelined Johnson & Johnson inoculations, increased shipment plans for other shots have kept on track a plan by health officials to offer jabs to all adults by the end of July.Story continuesThe economy contracted in the first quarter as virus-related restrictions dented spending, but the government last month moved to the second of a four-stage reopening plan, largely in line with the Norges Bank’s outlook.Still, some last-minute headwinds may be emerging. Some economists say doubts about the path of the pandemic will force the central bank to strike a more reserved tone about the outlook for rate increases.Norway’s health authorities on Tuesday revised the national vaccination schedule, meaning that second shots may now be administered as much as nine weeks later than Norges Bank assumes, according to DNB Bank’s analysts Oddmund Berg and Kjersti Haugland.“The new vaccination scenarios are a reminder that there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding vaccinations, infection control measures, and activity development.,” they said in a research report on Wednesday. “This uncertainty does not seem to be well reflected in market pricing.”(Updates with revised vaccine schedule in final two paragraphs)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.18,0.14,0.68,True,English,,"['start', 'poised', 'countdown', 'vaccination', 'guide', 'month', 'banks', 'increase', 'economy', 'decision', 'second', 'rate', 'liftoff', 'norway', 'bank', 'norges', 'central']",2021-06-16,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

And they’re particularity popular when there’s less risk for volatility, which only underscores the room for a rally now that the ECB has made its backstop so explicit.“The ECB has done whatever they can to influence bond markets for a calm summer,” said Piet Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank A/S.At more than 100 basis points, the extra yield on Italian and Greek 10-year debt over equivalent German bunds is almost triple the average across other euro area peers. German bondholders would have made a loss of nearly 1% over the past year, while those holding Italian or Greek debt would have netted returns of over 6%, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.“The ECB’s finger is nowhere near the trigger,” said Vuk Magdelinic, chief executive officer of fixed income analytics firm Overbond. “In fact, the safety catch is still firmly on and there’s still no sign of it changing course.”The ECB’s next policy meeting is on July 22, but the Sept. 9 session is the most likely one for any shift. The Governing Council will have another round of updated economic projections to consider, the European Union should be close to its vaccination target, and the disbursements under the bloc’s recovery fund should have started.Story continuesHeated DebateThat could make for a more heated debate over the pace of emergency bond buying and potentially encourage more-hawkish policy makers to try to start talks on how to phase out the program. The current end-date is set at March 2022.Until then, though, the region’s bond markets can rely the ECB’s purchases. That’s a windfall for countries like Italy, where the debt load has spiraled toward 160% of economic output amid the coronavirus pandemic, yet bond yields have still plummeted to record lows .“The ECB was wanting to avoid the impression that securities purchases could be scaled back, i.e. that the monetary policy stance could become less expansionary,” said Joerg Angele, senior economist of Bantleon Bank AG.Italian bonds extended gains for a fourth day on Friday as the 10-year yield fell as much as five basis points to 0.75%. Greek bonds also advanced, with the 30-year yield sliding to an all-time low. The euro was broadly steady, with currency markets largely reacting to a faster-than-expected pickup in U.S. consumer prices.While inflationary pressures the other side of the Atlantic could spur the Federal Reserve into tapering its own asset-purchase program, Lagarde warned of any undue tightening of financial conditions in Europe. She also said that inflationary pressures in the euro area were largely transitory.Traders in money markets aren’t pricing in any rate hike from the current record-low of minus 0.5% until 2023 at the earliest, with only around one basis point of decreases priced in over the next year.“It does set us up for a more hawkish turn, come September,” said Jacqui Douglas, chief European macro strategist for TD Securities in London. “The doves have won the summer.”(Updates prices throughout.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",negative,0.45,0.02,0.53,mixed,0.22,0.08,0.7,True,English,,"['ecb', 'greek', 'ecbs', 'riskiest', 'markets', 'boost', 'europes', 'bond', 'yield', 'program', 'policy', 'bank', 'securities', 'debt']",2021-06-11,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

The prospect of the NextGenerationEU program has itself been a boon for borrowing costs across the region, narrowing the premium faced by riskier debt issuers like Greece and Italy.Two more sales are set to come by the end of July, and the first green bonds may start as early as autumn. The EU also plans to issue bonds via auction, as well as sell short-dated bills as part of its plans to become a fully-fledged debt issuer.“The Commission took advantage of the huge demand,” said ABN strategist Floortje Merten. “Two more syndicated deals to follow before August, they don’t have so much time before demand becomes more muted due to summer holidays, so perhaps that also explains the big size issued today.”Story continuesThe lead managers for the sale were Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA, with bookrunners including BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley. The EU excluded 10 of the heaviest-hitting banks in the debt market, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., over historic breaches of antitrust rules, according to the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter.Europe is emerging from the pandemic as the speed of vaccine distribution ramps up. That’s seen bets mount for a rapid economic recovery this year, but also inflation, a scourge for bond investors. The European Central Bank is expected to announce a winding down of its pandemic purchase program in September, having held off from making the decision last week.Banks highlighted the relative cheapness of the bond when the EU opened orderbooks on Monday, which is often used as a way for issuers to entice investors into buying up a new security. The pricing was set at two basis points below midswaps, a tightening from the initial price thoughts Monday.“It is just flying,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. “They have done the safe choice of doing a 10-year bond and giving a decent new issue premium.”EuropeEight issuers have brought eight tranches to market so far today, giving a minimum volume of 23 billion euros including the EU sale.In sovereigns, Germany sold 4.068 billion euros of bonds due Jun 16, 2023 in an auction, with order books covered 1.19 timesPublic sector issuer AfDB is also marketing a GBP benchmark 5Y, while a flurry of financials -- including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and La Banque Postale -- are readying fresh dealsElsewhere, Deutsche Bank is set to rake in $1 billion on trader Mark Spehn’s shipping betThe distressed-debt trader wagered under $100 million on bonds and bank loans of Zim Integrated Shipping Services that were trading at a heavy discount; those investments have now surged and could effectively hand Deutsche Bank a win that would be equal to about a quarter of its 2020 investment banking profitRead more: Deutsche Bank Set to Reap $1 Billion on Trader’s Freight Bet (1)AsiaTwo Australian banks and a Chinese real estate firm kept activity in Asia’s primary dollar bond market ticking ahead of this week’s Fed meeting.Macquarie Group starts building books for its three-part bond Tuesday, while ANZ Banking Group’s unit in New Zealand looks to price a dollar offering.

The banks have been temporarily barred from the lucrative trades as the bloc assesses whether they’ve done enough to fix previous breaches of antitrust rules.The move has the potential to reshape debt league tables for the region, hand hefty fees to smaller competitors and even weigh on bankers’ bonuses. Tuesday’s 20-billion euro issuance by the bloc -- the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction -- may have generated more than $20 million in fees, according to estimates by Bloomberg.Syndications are a “cash cow,” said Liam O’Donnell, head of nominal rates at Aberdeen Standard Investments. It “certainly would have been a profitable environment recently with multiple syndications.”The banks affected are a Who’s Who of global banking with Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UniCredit SpA, NatWest Group Plc, Natixis SA and Credit Agricole SA also barred. Spokespeople for the 10 banks declined or didn’t respond to requests for comment. IFR reported the news earlier.“These banks have to demonstrate and to prove that they have taken all the necessary remedial actions which have been demanded by the Commission when deciding about these cases,” budget commissioner Johannes Hahn told reporters Tuesday. “We now expect the submission of the necessary information and then of course we have to analyze and assess it. I cannot predict how long it takes.”While the exclusion is unlikely to make or break the trading year for most desks, the scale of the missed fees could snowball. Another two syndications are due before the end of July.Story continuesThe EU’s big-ticket transactions account for a large part of banks’ business in the European market for new bond issues this year. The amount of EU bonds that dealer banks have sold this year typically amounts to more than 10% of their transactions in other European bonds, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.This makes it hard to effectively replace the EU as a source of fee revenue in Europe. Even though other issuers may offer a higher fee than the EU’s 0.1% for this maturity, they are nowhere near as prolific in terms of issuance volume.Primary DealersThe 10 banks barred from the syndications are among a list of 39 so-called “primary dealers,” which have a responsibility to bid for bonds during regular debt auctions. The EU is expected to begin those in September.Stopping banks from participating in bond sales is rare, and a first for the EU since it started selling debt in meaningful sizes under its social program last year. Morgan Stanley temporarily lost its status as a primary dealer of French government bonds in August as a result of transactions that took place in 2015.In April this year, Bank of America was among banks fined about 28.5 million euros by European Union regulators for colluding in chatrooms on trading of U.S. supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds. And in May, Nomura and UniCredit were among those fined for colluding on euro government bond trading during the region’s sovereign debt crisis.Investor DemandThe missing banks didn’t seem to dent demand Tuesday with around 142 billion euros of investor orders for the offering. The lead managers for Tuesday’s sale were BNP Paribas SA, DZ Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Morgan Stanley, with Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA hired as co-leads.Despite its hardline stance, the EU offered some hope of a swift resolution to the banks it has excluded -- assuming they satisfy its requirements.It is in the EU’s “interest to include all the key players and banks which have qualified themselves for the primary dealer network,” Hahn, the commissioner, said. “But of course the legal aspects have to be respected.”(Adds superlative in third paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.15,0.13,0.72,True,English,,"['losing', 'european', 'cow', 'bonds', 'trillion', 'banks', 'eu', 'transactions', 'bond', 'ban', 'cash', 'trading', 'primary', 'sale', 'risk', 'bank', 'debt']",2021-06-15,finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

We successfully conducted the first funding operation for NextGenerationEU,” she told reporters.The first syndicated issuance saw a demand of €142 billion for the EU’s 10-year bond offer. The Commission had to pay interest below 1%.Investors’ appetite was inferior to the €230 billion record volume demanded last October during the first bond sale to finance the SURE mechanism aimed at supporting workers in the EU, including 10-year and 20-year bonds.EU makes bond market history with record €233 bln demand for SURE issue The European Union attracted the highest demand ever for a bond sale on Tuesday (20 October) at over €233 billion, bankers involved in the deal said, as it kicked off fund raising for its SURE unemployment scheme.The Commissioner for Budget, Johannes Hahn said the successful issuance represented the largest amount raised by the EU or any other supranational organisation at once.The €20 billion obtained is also above the amount of around €12.5 billion the Commission expected to raise per month to finance the recovery fund.More than 50% of the buyers, Hahn explained, were based in the EU. Among them, some 25% were central banks, 37% pension funds and 11% insurance funds. The Austrian commissioner said he was happy with the attraction of long-term investors.A total of seven banks participated in the syndicated sale, in which financial institutions are paid to attract big buyers.The joint lead managers were BNP Paribas, DZ BANK, HSBC, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo, and Morgan Stanley. Co-leads were Danske Bank and Santander.The Commission, however, decided to exclude 10 banks due to outstanding issues related to their involvement in past anti-trust cases.The list of banned banks included JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America, among others.Hahn said the Commission is assessing the remedial measures that these banks proposed in each case and would act “as fast as possible”, given the interest in getting large banks on board for the unprecedented bond sale over the coming years.The €800 billion needed to finance the recovery fund by 2026, together with the €90 billion already raised in the markets for SURE, will turn the EU into the largest supranational borrower, at par with the debt issuance of Germany or Spain.Some 30% of the recovery fund will be funded by green bonds, once the bloc publishes its green bond framework, expected by September.The Commission will go to the markets again twice before the summer break. In total, the EU executive expects to issue €80 billion in bonds by the end of the year, and an additional amount of treasury bills.With these initial sales, the Commission expects to cover the first transfers of recovery funds to member states – 13% of their corresponding amount in prefinancing once the plans are approved.The Commission is expected to give the first positive assessments to the Spanish and Portuguese plans on Wednesday, as von der Leyen will travel to Madrid and Lisbon to deliver the Commission’s opinions on the national investment and reform proposals.On Thursday, she will visit Denmark and Greece, and Luxembourg on Friday. More trips are expected to come in the next few days, as part of the approval of the first batch of national plans.The Commission is expected to approve by the end of June twelve plans submitted by 30 April, including those from Italy, France, and Germany, an EU official told EURACTIV.Once the EU executive validates the national recovery plans, the Council is expected to give its opinion during the Ecofin Council of 27 EU finance and economy ministers on 13 July.

Weber is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of “How China Escaped Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate.” ©Project Syndicate, 2021","The fiscal expansion in the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is like nothing seen outside of wartime. Further large-scale public spending will be required to rebuild needed infrastructure, tackle climate change and create jobs.But some prominent economists are warning that government spending on such an extraordinary scale could fuel accelerating price growth and cause inflation expectations to become unanchored.For more than three decades, expectations of moderate price growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies have been sustained — not least by China’s integration into the global economy. Might China come to the rescue as the Biden administration seeks to open the fiscal floodgates?There are certainly reasons to be wary of price risks. At the core of Biden’s initiative are infrastructure investments, which require materials such as steel and copper. And, in 2021, commodity prices have soared, triggered by supply-side bottlenecks and the global economic recovery.These commodity price rises have stoked fear of inflation. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, for example, warned last month that the U.S. might be headed toward an inflationary episode on par with the years after World War II, when the release of pent-up demand fueled a 20% surge in prices.Enter China. Late last month, the country’s government announced that it would strengthen targeted efforts to bring down the prices of iron ore, copper, steel and other major commodities that had pushed China’s consumer prices to a 12-year high. The government’s initiative to halt the rise in commodity prices is bound to also help contain the prices of a wide range of durable consumer goods that countries like the U.S. import from China.As Keith Bradsher put it, China’s attempt to tame inflation matters for the globe. As Danske Bank Chief Economist Michael Grahn observed, this puts a “dent” in the “‘inflation is coming’ narrative.”In fact, stabilization of prices of strategic commodities has played a major role in enabling China to achieve rapid economic growth without inflation. And yet, it was not always clear that China’s government would take such a hands-on approach to economic management.As I show in “How China Escaped Shock Therapy,” during the early years of Deng Xiaoping’s policy of “reform and opening up,” many argued that China should embrace “shock therapy” — kicked off by abrupt and comprehensive price deregulation (in order to reset relative prices) followed by large-scale privatization and total trade liberalization. After all, they noted, West Germany implemented overnight price liberalizations after WWII, to great success. Western free-market economists, such as Milton Friedman, strongly supported this approach.China took this advice seriously. On two separate occasions in the 1980s, it nearly implemented the first step of shock therapy. In 1988, China came to the brink of a big bang, unleashing a short inflationary spurt that helped prepare the ground for the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Ultimately, the Chinese leadership refrained from a sudden price liberalization. It did not want to make the same mistake the U.S. had after WWII.During WWII the U.S. had reverted to comprehensive price controls after the initial attempts to contain inflation with partial controls failed. After the war, the question was, what to do about prices.In 1946, 54 economists — including 11 former presidents of the American Economic Association and distinguished figures like Paul Samuelson and Irving Fisher — published an open letter advocating the gradual release of price controls. With “unprecedented” levels of demand, they cautioned, “the supply of raw materials and consumer goods” would be “inadequate to stave off a serious inflation in the next year, unless price control is continued without crippling amendments.” Such controls should be removed only when “supply and demand of any important commodity” are “more in balance at ceiling prices.”President Harry S. Truman withdrew price controls anyway. And, as the Atlanta Fed’s recent report reminded us, inflation soared, devaluing savings. So, when economists warned in the 1980s that sudden withdrawal of price controls in China would lead to runaway inflation, China’s leaders listened.The approach they pursued instead emerged from China’s agricultural reforms. Initially, output quotas and prices were left unchanged, but responsibility for production was shifted from communes to households. If households managed to produce more than their designated share, they could sell the excess at market prices.In the urban economy, China repurposed the existing institutions of the planned economy into market creators and participants in core sectors. This allowed the Chinese state to continue to steer individual sectors, even as it largely relinquished its direct control over the economy in the 1980s and 1990s and engaged in wide-ranging privatizations.Today, China has largely withdrawn direct price controls. But the government continues to intervene in goods markets when it deems it necessary to stabilize specific prices, mainly through policies that increase supply or by cracking down on hoarding and speculation. A Price Department exists to this day at the National Development and Reform Commission. In the current context, it has assumed renewed relevance.The Biden administration is working toward a New Deal-type reconstruction, and some rightly advocate a National Investment Authority, modeled after the Reconstruction Finance Corporation established in 1932. But when it comes to the lessons of the past, the price stabilization policies that accompanied war-scale spending have so far received little consideration in the U.S. policy debate. China’s initiative to crack down on the prices that have fueled inflation fears in the U.S. might help counter hawkish sentiment and prepare the ground for Biden’s public investment push.Isabella M.

The Irish unit’s balance sheet more than doubled in 2020 to just shy of €135 billion - knocking Bank of Ireland, with assets of €134 billion, off the top spot.“It was a huge undertaking, but has been extremely successful,” says Ceccato. “Establishing the entity in Ireland and expanding our presence here has also presented more opportunities for senior roles to be based in Dublin.”Dublin has emerged as the most popular choice for UK banks, insurers and asset managers to move activities since the Brexit referendum in 2016, with 36 out of 222 top financial services firms monitored by EY having confirmed or said they are considering the Irish capital. These include: nine universal banks, investment banks and brokerages, including TD Securities and Bank of America and Numis Securities; 18 wealth and asset managers, ranging from Legal & General and Morgan Stanley to Legg Mason; and six insurers or insurance brokers, such as Standard Life, XL Reinsurance and Beazley.Luxembourg holds second place, at 29, with Frankfurt coming in third, at 23, and Paris, fourth, at 14. However, Dublin ranks third in job announcements, at 1,200 - less than half of those that have been shifting to Paris and some 500 fewer than Frankfurt.Bank of America established the Republic as the hub of its EU banking arm in 2018, merging its existing Irish unit - inherited from its rescue takeover of Merrill Lynch a decade earlier - with its London arm to create a bank with €50 billion of assets. Still, the unit is far off its heyday, when Merrill Lynch International Bank in Dublin had $593 billion (€488 billion) of assets, by far the largest bank in the State, before it moved a massive derivatives book to the UK in the first half of the last decade.OverseasCitigroup, one of the first major overseas banks to enter the State when it set up a base on Dawson Street in 1965, had, by good fortune, established its Irish unit as its main European arm months before the Brexit vote. The group employs about 2,500 in the Republic. Citibank Europe chief executive Cecilia Ronan signaled in an interview in April that she sees further growth in the unit in the coming years as more business transfers from London.“Brexit has contributed to the expansion of the financial services landscape in Ireland which is now recognised as an emerging financial centre within and beyond Europe. Many financial services firms have had operations in Ireland since the 1980s so it made sense for them to leverage their well-established Irish entities in their strategic response to Brexit,” says Fidelma Clarke, EY Ireland’s financial services Brexit lead.Peter Oakes, a former Central Bank enforcement director and founder of Fintech Ireland, which reports the country’s financial technology scene, says that some firms that have delayed making Brexit moves are increasingly looking at Dublin.“Companies that moved activities in 2019 or 2020 are now part of the narrative, and offer an example, when you are talking to firms still considering their options,” he said. “We’re going to see a divergence between the UK and EU on financial services laws and regulations over time. If you want to be in both jurisdictions, you’ll have to staff up entities in both. What stands in Ireland’s favour for many financial institutions is that it’s a common law jurisdiction, as opposed to the codified law you see on the continent, which is piecemeal at best.”But it hasn’t been one-way traffic. A number of European banks that set up operations in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in the 1990s - including DZ Bank, Helaba and Commerzbank - have handed back their Irish licences since the financial crisis as their parents seek to release capital that is “trapped” in various subsidiaries and streamline their own organisations.Italian financial services giant UniCredit confirmed in May it is to close its IFSC operation after more than quarter of a century and transfer its operations and €12.9 billion balance sheet back to Milan.EconomyMeanwhile, a slew of overseas lenders into the domestic Irish economy, including Danske Bank, Bank of Scotland and Rabobank, have retrenched from the retail market since the financial crisis.Ulster Bank and KBC Bank Ireland have also signaled in recent months that they plan to exit the Republic as the level of expensive capital Irish lenders must hold against loans, a legacy of the crash, has made it more difficult to generate acceptable returns for their head offices. The remaining three high-street banks, Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB, are in talks to buy parts of the departing banks’ assets. Bank of Ireland chief executive Francesca McDonagh is hoping to conclude a deal to acquire KBC Ireland’s €9 billion of performing loans by early 2022.Barclays Bank Ireland’s time as the largest bank in the State could prove short lived.",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.45,0.14,0.41,True,English,,"['services', 'dublin', 'financial', 'billion', 'ireland', 'banks', 'irelands', 'barclays', 'unit', 'brexit', 'irish', 'bank', 'rose', 'biggest']",2021-06-11,irishtimes.com,EUREX

Equinor announces that it will accelerate its ambitions to reach zero emissions by 2050, now targeting 40% reduction by 2035. This will be met by dedicating over 50% of its capex towards renewables by 2030 (excl. project finance). We see this as a step in the right direction, but also note the long lead time before renewable capex is stepped up, and also flag that this only relates to Equinor’s own emissions. I.e. not the emissions coming from the usage of its products. Equinor is also updating its financial guidance, pointing to a free cash flow (excl. shareholder distributions) of USD5.8bn a year in 2021-2026 (an implicit upgrade compared to the USD3.5bn realised in 20). The new FCF forecast is based on an oil price of USD60/bbl). Finally, Equinor raises its quarterly dividend payment to USD568m from USD489m. In addition, Equinor announced a USD500m share buy back program for 2021 and annual USD1.2bn from 2022. This program will be contingent on an oil price above USD50/bbl and Equinor keeping net debt to capital employed below 30% (was 32% at end 2020).

The banks have been temporarily barred from the lucrative trades as the bloc assesses whether they’ve done enough to fix previous breaches of antitrust rules.The move has the potential to reshape debt league tables for the region, hand hefty fees to smaller competitors and even weigh on bankers’ bonuses. Tuesday’s 20-billion euro issuance by the bloc -- the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction -- may have generated more than $20 million in fees, according to estimates by Bloomberg.Syndications are a “cash cow,” said Liam O’Donnell, head of nominal rates at Aberdeen Standard Investments. It “certainly would have been a profitable environment recently with multiple syndications.”The banks affected are a Who’s Who of global banking with Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UniCredit SpA, NatWest Group Plc, Natixis SA and Credit Agricole SA also barred. Spokespeople for the 10 banks declined or didn’t respond to requests for comment. IFR reported the news earlier.“These banks have to demonstrate and to prove that they have taken all the necessary remedial actions which have been demanded by the Commission when deciding about these cases,” budget commissioner Johannes Hahn told reporters Tuesday. “We now expect the submission of the necessary information and then of course we have to analyze and assess it. I cannot predict how long it takes.”While the exclusion is unlikely to make or break the trading year for most desks, the scale of the missed fees could snowball. Another two syndications are due before the end of July.Story continuesThe EU’s big-ticket transactions account for a large part of banks’ business in the European market for new bond issues this year. The amount of EU bonds that dealer banks have sold this year typically amounts to more than 10% of their transactions in other European bonds, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.This makes it hard to effectively replace the EU as a source of fee revenue in Europe. Even though other issuers may offer a higher fee than the EU’s 0.1% for this maturity, they are nowhere near as prolific in terms of issuance volume.Primary DealersThe 10 banks barred from the syndications are among a list of 39 so-called “primary dealers,” which have a responsibility to bid for bonds during regular debt auctions. The EU is expected to begin those in September.Stopping banks from participating in bond sales is rare, and a first for the EU since it started selling debt in meaningful sizes under its social program last year. Morgan Stanley temporarily lost its status as a primary dealer of French government bonds in August as a result of transactions that took place in 2015.In April this year, Bank of America was among banks fined about 28.5 million euros by European Union regulators for colluding in chatrooms on trading of U.S. supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds. And in May, Nomura and UniCredit were among those fined for colluding on euro government bond trading during the region’s sovereign debt crisis.Investor DemandThe missing banks didn’t seem to dent demand Tuesday with around 142 billion euros of investor orders for the offering. The lead managers for Tuesday’s sale were BNP Paribas SA, DZ Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Morgan Stanley, with Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA hired as co-leads.Despite its hardline stance, the EU offered some hope of a swift resolution to the banks it has excluded -- assuming they satisfy its requirements.It is in the EU’s “interest to include all the key players and banks which have qualified themselves for the primary dealer network,” Hahn, the commissioner, said. “But of course the legal aspects have to be respected.”(Adds superlative in third paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.15,0.13,0.72,True,English,,"['losing', 'european', 'cow', 'bonds', 'trillion', 'banks', 'eu', 'transactions', 'bond', 'ban', 'cash', 'trading', 'primary', 'sale', 'risk', 'bank', 'debt']",2021-06-16,ca.finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

Yet, even as the Covid-19 pandemic persisted, Gujarat Gas saw a sharp recovery with record volumes in Q3/Q4, leading to year-on-year flat volumes for FY21.”While the second wave of Covid-19 infections was more intense, lockdowns were less strict. And due to Gujarat Gas’ higher industrial share, its volume revival was the sharpest in FY21 among peers, Nomura said. “We expect a similar trend in FY22.”Besides, Gujarat Gas’ margin expansion in FY21 was a reflection of its stronger pricing power, the research firm said. “In our earlier report, we noted that city gas distributors are effectively monopolies with strong pricing power. FY21 reinforces our belief as Gujarat Gas’ unit gas costs fell nearly 15% but its price cuts were modest. It reported record gross margin of Rs 8.4 per standard cubic meter, a 19% year-on-year rise; and Ebitda margin of Rs 6.1 per standard cubic metre, a 29% jump over the year earlier.”Improving OutlookNomura, in its January report, had indicated that the National Green Tribunal’s order to curb pollution in Morbi, a hub for ceramic production, has changed fortunes for Gujarat Gas.That, it said, is evident as:The NGT’s order has resulted in nearly a threefold jump in average gas consumption in Morbi area. Morbi now accounts for more than 60% of Gujarat Gas’ total volumes, and 75% of its industrial/commercial volumes (excluding CNG and domestic gas).Nearly all incremental gas to meet the higher demand was sourced from spot LNG markets.As spot LNG prices were relatively softer in 2019 and 2020, Gujarat Gas’ average gas cost also declined. Lower gas prices resulted in robust volume growth in industrial demand in areas outside Morbi as well.Nomura raised its earnings per share forecast for Gujarat Gas by 35% and 42%, respectively, for FY22 and FY23. “We expect a 26% EPS CAGR over FY21-23F.”Downside RisksKey risks, according to Nomura, include:A sharp increase in spot/long-term LNG pricesThe company’s inability to increase industrial/commercial PNG pricesLower-than-expected pickup in CNG/PNG volumes and lower Ebitda margin.If there is a cut in lower-priced domestic gas allocation to city gas distributors and/or the regulator decides low tariffs for open access to third-party marketers.Shares of Gujarat Gas rose as much as 8.61%, the most since March 1, to trade at Rs 653.40 apiece before paring gains. Of the 32 analysts tracking the company, 23 have a ‘buy’ rating, six suggest a ‘hold’ and three recommend a ‘sell’, according to Bloomberg data.

REUTERS/Stringer/File PhotoTOKYO, June 10 (Reuters) - Despite growing local opposition amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Tokyo Olympic Games that were postponed last year will get under way in less than two months - barring ""Armageddon"", as one International Olympic Committee member said.But the delay so far has been expensive in various ways. Here are some areas where costs have grown, and where income that had been expected will not materialise.OLYMPIC COSTSOrganisers said last December that the entire cost of holding the Games would come to about $15.4 billion, including $2.8 billion in costs for the unprecedented postponement from 2020. Since then, the projected bill for postponement has risen to $3 billion.Figures released in December estimated that ticket sales would contribute $800 million for the Tokyo organising committee. But much of this could be lost given that foreign spectators are banned, and domestic fans may be sharply limited in number at best, or even absent - a decision on whether to admit Japanese fans is expected later in June.Local ticket sales have typically accounted for 70-80% of the total at past Olympic Games. Organisers said in March, when foreign fans were banned, that they planned to refund around 600,000 tickets but did not say how much this would cost.SPONSORSMore than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3 billion to sponsor the Games. Sponsors paid another $200 million to extend contracts after the Olympics were postponed.That does not include partnerships with Japanese companies Toyota, Bridgestone, and Panasonic, and others such as South Korea's Samsung, who through a separate programme for top-tier sponsors have separate deals with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) worth hundreds of millions of dollars.INSURANCEAlthough the cancellation scenario is looking less likely by the day, global insurers would face a hefty bill should that happen, with estimates running to a loss of $2-3 billion.The IOC takes out about $800 million of protection for each Summer Games, which covers most of the roughly $1 billion investment it makes in each host city.Local organisers in Tokyo will have taken out a further policy, estimated at around $650 million.Analysts with the financial services firm Jefferies estimate the insured cost of the 2020 Olympics at $2 billion, including TV rights and sponsorship, plus $600 million for hospitality.MEDIABroadcaster NBCUniversal had reaped a record $1.25 billion in U.S. national advertising spending for the Games before they were postponed in 2020 and has spent the past year trying to get sponsors to support them again this year, entertainment business magazine Variety reported.NBCUniversal's parent company, Comcast (CMCSA.O), agreed to pay $4.38 billion for U.S. media rights to four Olympics from 2014 to 2020, it added.Discovery Communications, the parent of television channel Eurosport, has agreed to pay 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to screen the Olympics from 2018 to 2024 across Europe.HIT TO THE ECONOMYThe Olympics were originally expected to be a huge tourist draw, but banning foreign spectators put paid to hopes of an early recovery in inbound tourism, frozen since last year.In 2019, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent nearly 4.81 trillion yen ($44 bln). Numbers plunged 87% in 2020 to just 4.1 million, a 22-year low.Though highly unlikely at this point, a full cancellation would mean lost stimulus of 1.8 trillion yen ($16.4 bln), or 0.33% of GDP, the Nomura Research Institute said in a recent report.But Nomura Research Institute executive economist Takahide Kiuchi said that loss would pale in comparison to the economic hit from emergency curbs if the Games turned into a super-spreader event.""If the (Olympic Games) trigger the spread of infections and necessitates another emergency declaration, then the economic loss would be much greater,"" Kiuchi said.($1 = 109.4800 yen)Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Kenneth MaxwellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.06,0.16,0.78,True,English,,"['cost', 'games', 'billion', 'pandemicdelayed', 'tokyos', 'million', 'foreign', 'money', 'factbox', '2020', 'sponsors', 'paid', 'olympics', 'tokyo', 'olympic']",2021-06-10,reuters.com,EUREX

In a nutshell, we can see the economic rebound is peaking,"" said Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia, Commerzbank.""The extent of the slowdown in the second half is key. So far, it's still normal and there's still room for the fiscal policy to play a part later in the year.""Most analysts had expected some moderation in May output due to softer export orders, higher input costs for factories and tighter environmental restrictions on heavy industry.Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Pearl River Delta since late May also have brought some key ports to a standstill, economists at Nomura said in a note to clients, though it believes the current spate of infections can be contained in a relatively short period of time.Fu Linghui, an NBS official, said external risks also remain, such as still rising global COVID-19 infections, an uneven recovery in the world economy and spill-over effects from large stimulus programmes from some countries.BRIGHT SPOTSRetail sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in May, weaker than 13.6% growth expected by analysts and down from the 17.7% jump seen in April.Chinese consumer and business confidence has been picking up thanks to pent-up demand and quickening vaccine rollouts, which are also reviving domestic tourism.Two-year average growth for retail sales stood at 4.5% in May, faster than the 4.3% in April, in a sign that sales are gradually rebounding, Fu from NBS told reporters.Fixed asset investment increased 15.4% in the first five months from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 16.9% rise, slowing from January-April's 19.9% increase.Notably, two-year average growth in manufacturing investment turned positive in May.""What is gratifying is some weak indicators such as consumption and manufacturing investments are showing some improvement,"" Li Huiyong, deputy general manager at Hwabao WP Fund Management Co., adding that he expects the trend to continue.China's unemployment rate also continued to drop.

In a nutshell, we can see the economic rebound is peaking,"" said Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia, Commerzbank.""The extent of the slowdown in the second half is key. So far, it's still normal and there's still room for the fiscal policy to play a part later in the year.""Most analysts had expected some moderation in May output due to softer export orders, higher input costs for factories and tighter environmental restrictions on heavy industry.Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Pearl River Delta since late May also have brought some key ports to a standstill, economists at Nomura said in a note to clients, though it believes the current spate of infections can be contained in a relatively short period of time.Fu Linghui, an NBS official, said external risks also remain, such as still rising global COVID-19 infections, an uneven recovery in the world economy and spill-over effects from large stimulus programmes from some countries.BRIGHT SPOTSRetail sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in May, weaker than 13.6% growth expected by analysts and down from the 17.7% jump seen in April.Chinese consumer and business confidence has been picking up thanks to pent-up demand and quickening vaccine rollouts, which are also reviving domestic tourism.Two-year average growth for retail sales stood at 4.5% in May, faster than the 4.3% in April, in a sign that sales are gradually rebounding, Fu from NBS told reporters.Fixed asset investment increased 15.4% in the first five months from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 16.9% rise, slowing from January-April's 19.9% increase.Notably, two-year average growth in manufacturing investment turned positive in May.""What is gratifying is some weak indicators such as consumption and manufacturing investments are showing some improvement,"" Li Huiyong, deputy general manager at Hwabao WP Fund Management Co., adding that he expects the trend to continue.China's unemployment rate also continued to drop.

It will be approved by the cabinet on June 18 after deliberations by the ruling bloc.""We will aim to achieve our fiscal target including the goal to bring a primary budget surplus,"" Suga told a panel meeting, adding the government also will strive to bring nationwide average minimum wage to 1,000 yen ($9.13) per hour to fix disparities. read moreFor next year's budget, the blueprint urged directing more resources to four areas: digital transformation, a greener society, the revival of regions and childcare support to cope with the fast-ageing population.""We must accelerate investment that will lead to sustainable growth in a post-coronavirus era,"" the blueprint showed.

Major support is not far away at the June low of $0.7646 and a breach would risk a retreat to $0.7580.The kiwi was looking vulnerable at $0.7136, after briefly breaking support at $0.7116 overnight. It risks a return to $0.7070 or even $0.7000.Much depends on whether Fed members lift forecasts for rates and inflation, and whether Chair Jerome Powell stays dovish in his post-meeting news conference.“From a market perspective, the key will be whether the FOMC began ‘talking about talking’ about tapering its asset purchases,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “We think that is a strong likelihood.”“However, we think Fed Chair Powell will strongly emphasise that this is just the beginning of an extended discussion,” he added. “Indeed, we suspect that he will reiterate that the recent jump in inflation is ‘transitory’.”Market thinking on domestic policy could also change when Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe gives a speech on the economy on Thursday.Minutes of its June meeting showed it would consider a number of possible revisions to its bond buying campaign at its July policy meeting. “Given the sharp V-shaped recovery that is now evident, we think it appropriate to pull back a little on unusually aggressive policy accommodation, and we think the governor should set out a carefully crafted case for doing so,” argued Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst.He expects the RBA will not extend its yield target to November 2024, but will set another round of bond buying albeit at a slower pace than the present A$5 billion s week.Expectations that the yield target will remain tied to the April 2024 bond led to a sharp shift in three-year bond futures when the June contract expired on Tuesday.The September contract is trading at 99.660, implying a yield of 0.34%, while the June contract had ended at 99.846 for a yield of 0.154%.The move in 10-year bond futures was more modest, with the September contract at 98.4500 compared to the June close at 98.5510.

The Monetary Policy Committee needs to shift focus from growth to inflation, and a reverse-repo rate hike is possible in the second half of this fiscal, she added.Nomura expects half of India’s population to be fully vaccinated by December 2021, but to get there, the country needs to accelerate inoculation, which is important as it would drive monetary policy, fiscal policy and the economic outlook, she said.Edited excerpts:COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more ShowThe pandemic has widened the wealth gap between India’s rich and its poor. Many stakeholders, including industry bodies and economists, are calling for an income support scheme. What are your views?I think we essentially do need a two-pronged strategy. The reality is that India has the limited fiscal space, we need to spend on infrastructure, health education. So we need to focus on these investments. But at the same time, we have to also ensure that there is a mechanism in place to support households who have been affected during the lockdown, so a mechanism needs to be in place, but I would make it more temporary, rather than making it permanent.Cash transfer may be actually a better way to do this, where you're distributing cash transfers to a pocket of population during periods of economic distress, but you're not making it permanent, because then that opens a Pandora's box, which in turn will have macro and political implications.Your FY2021-22 GDP growth forecast is around 10.4 percent. What are your assumptions behind the forecast, and what makes you more optimistic than Reserve Bank of India?I'll say that our forecast of 10.4 versus RBI’s forecast of 9.5 per cent, in this pandemic, one percentage point is within margin of error. But that's on a lighter note. More seriously speaking, I think the key question is, what is the impact of the second wave going to be in the April-June quarter GDP? And our analysis essentially shows that the economic hit will be quite small. On the whole for this quarter, we are looking at around 4 per cent contraction in GDP compared to January-March quarter, seasonally adjusted.If you compare this to first wave impact, which was close to minus 25 per cent, it's actually a fraction. I think this assumption is essentially what sets our forecasts apart from the RBI numbers, which are assuming more of an economic damage. And the reason we have a more optimistic view is because of multiple things. First of all, unlike last year, the lockdowns were not as severe this time. We've already seen the impact on activity in April in general was not as severe. May is when the peak impact will be seen. And in June, with the reopening underway, sequentially we are already seeing high-frequency data pick up So on average in this quarter, it's not going to be as bad as whatever estimates were made based on the assumption that lockdowns will continue for much longer or people will not step out.What is your year-on-year estimate for April-June quarter?On a year-on-year basis, our estimate is 29 percent GDP growth.I think the other aspect is that unlike the first wave where global growth had tanked, this time around global growth is essentially a tailwind. So the export side is definitely supportive. So when you have a mix of more nuanced lockdown where certain goods and construction activities are being allowed, and global growth and exports, which are much stronger, what comes out is that the consumption and your services side is where the impact will be majorly seen, but it's not going to be, but there will be offsets from industry and exports. Also, businesses and consumers have adapted to the new normal.For this financial year, I think clearly the resurgence of virus remains a risk and it's really hard to predict that. But based on the analysis we've done in terms of availability of vaccines, particularly after July, plus our view that global growth will be quite strong on the whole, our view is that consumer sentiment, which is extremely depressed right now, will see a gradual recovery, and financial conditions are quite accommodative. So on the whole, we think these factors will support growth.As you said, a lot depends on the pace of vaccination, and I think you expect at least 50 percent of the population to be vaccinated by the end of the current calendar year. We are right now at 3.5 percent of the population fully vaccinated. Is that good enough? Do you think that the central and state governments and the private sector need to pick up the pace of vaccinations?There is no doubt that we need to pick up the pace of vaccinations. Whether it is monetary policy, fiscal policy, economic outlook, everything right now is hostage to health policy. So the only thing that we need to get right is our health policy, and everything else will follow. So this definitely is the high priority right now.What are the biggest downside risks to your GDP estimate for the current financial year? And what is your worst-case scenario? Do you have a number in mind?We don't have a worst-case scenario in terms of numbers. Because you never know what the worst case will be. But in terms of the risk factors clearly the pandemic resurgence and pace of vaccination are the biggest factors. I would say the other risk is also inflation, because that really is squeezing profitability for firms. And it's squeezing the real incomes for consumers. So that's definitely a risk that we are monitoring.You mentioned inflation. Retail inflation was at its highest in 6 months, while wholesale inflation touched record highs. How much of a concern is it for policymakers, going ahead, and what are your expectations from the Monetary Policy Committee?The steep jump in inflation in May, is an across the board increase, particularly core inflation. Unlike last year first wave where it was a statistical reason, this time around these are actual price quotation collections. So, things have moved up and this is clearly surprising. And I think the crucial question is whether this is one off and whether should the unlocking lead to a reversal of some of these price increases? The answer will actually vary across categories. Typically, what we've observed in India is prices tend to be more rigid on the downside. And specifically for a number of core categories, we may not see a full reversal. So, our assumption is it's going to be more of a partial reversal of the increase we've seen. Looking beyond right now, there are a few factors that do suggest the inflationary pressures will remain elevated.To our mind risks are very much to the upside. We have raised our inflation projections. For FY 22, we are now looking at close to 6 percent on headline inflation and core CPI between 6-6.5 percent. So, nearly a one percentage points upward revision.On the MPC, our view is that the second wave impact is not going to be as bad as is being expected. And clearly growth needs support, but the strategy has to be on the health policy side. Rightfully the MPC has overlooked inflation so far and prioritized growth, but I think the macro conditions going forward will require inflation to get a priority. This is not imminent, we're not expecting things to change in August. But come October and beyond our view is policy normalization in India will have to essentially start because we have rates which are extremely low, we have excess liquidity that is there and monetary policy works with long lags.Our forecast is for the reverse repo rate to be increased by 40 basis point, end of this calendar year. And we are in for a total of 75 basis point in rapid rate hike next calendar year.",neutral,0.29,0.65,0.06,mixed,0.39,0.09,0.52,True,English,,"['support', 'growth', 'policy', 'inflation', 'temporary', 'impact', 'sonal', 'view', 'think', 'needs', 'right', 'interview', 'vaccine', 'plan', 'need', 'going', 'likely', 'varma', 'rate', 'nomuras']",2021-06-16,moneycontrol.com,EUREX

Or 11 months late, depending on how you look at it.The bean crunchers are running the numbers on what it means if the Games are still cancelled, which now seems unlikely, or go ahead with limited or no spectators. The organizers have given themselves until the end of the month to decide whether to hold the Games at full capacity, half capacity or with no fans at all.There's a total economic benefit of ¥1.8 trillion (US$16.5 billion) if the Olympics go ahead, according to Takahide Kiuchi, the executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute. The organizers would take a ¥147 billion (US$1.3 billion) direct hit to their bottom line without any fans. There is a US$16.5 billion direct hit if they don't take place.We already know that no international travelers will be allowed in. Japan essentially has maintained closed borders since the start of the pandemic, and it has been hard even for permanent residents with foreign passports to get back home.That has already caused a ¥151.1 billion (US$1.4 billion) impairment to the bottom line, Kiuchi figures. International travelers would directly benefit Japan's economy with every yen they spend. Domestic fans may generate an economic benefit to Tokyo and the venue locations, but it is spending that comes at the cost of their hometowns.There are qualitative calculations that are harder to quantify. Sponsors are questioning how publicly they want to support the Games at a time when surveys show that they are incredibly unpopular with the Japanese public.What is the risk to your reputation of going big with publicity around your sponsorship? There are 47 major sponsors of the Games, contributing to the US$3 billion raised in sponsorship, and more than a handful have called in brand consulting companies such as Kantar, 60% owned by Boston-based Bain Capital, to answer that question.An advertising executive working with one of the 14 global sponsors told the Financial Times that some companies have developed two advertising campaigns, one with heavy Olympic symbolism and the other without. They will decide at the last minute which to use, depending on sentiment at the time.The athletic shoe company Asics ASCCY has been running an advertising campaign featuring athletes expected to compete at the Olympics. But there is scant reference to the actual event, with only a small rendition of the Olympic rings in a corner of the screen at the end of the commercial.The electronics maker NEC (NIPNF) has been caught up in crosscurrents that shine yet another unwelcome spotlight on the behavior of senior Japanese government officials. Technology minister Takuya Hirai is heard on a leaked tape telling subordinates to use ""threats"" to the chairman of NEC.At issue is the ¥7.3 billion (US$66.7 million) contract awarded to an NEC-led consortium to develop a facial recognition app for the Olympics in order to keep tabs on the health of foreign tourists and people staffing the Games.After the government said it would not allow foreign visitors into the Games, it reneged on the contract. Instead, it forced the consortium to accept a ¥3.8 billion fee. NEC had already completed almost all the work on the app.""I would die before placing orders with NEC"" after the Olympics, Hirai said on the tape, according to The Asahi Shimbun. He said the company would be left out to dry if it complained.The revelations of corporate coercion within government ranks come after a damning investigation into events at Toshiba TOSYY, which I covered on Monday. The trade ministry colluded with Toshiba executives to pressure investors not to vote alongside an activist fund demanding change at the electronics company.That investigation uncovered a meeting between Toshiba's CEO and Yoshihide Suga, who is now Japan's prime minister but was its No. 2 official at the time. Suga recommended ""aggressive"" action against the activist investors and said ""we can get them"" by using the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act.A poll in mid-May by The Asahi Shimbun showed that 83% of the Japanese public believes the Games should be postponed again or canceled. Only 14% of people said the Olympics should be held this summer and only 3% backed having stadiums at full capacity.I don't believe the Japanese public is so hell-bent against the Games. There has been almost no public demonstration of this supposedly staunch opposition to the Olympics, no marching in the streets, no lobbying of the Japanese government or petitions. Indeed, the opposition only seems to come to light in public polls.The opposition is also waning. A poll in early June by the Yomiuri Shimbun shows that 50% of respondents think the Games will go ahead, with 26% predicting they would take place in empty stadiums. Another 48% predict the Games will be cancelled.How you ask the survey question seems highly likely to provoke a response. It may be that the hosting of the Olympics is somehow already associated with the causation of the COVID-19 pandemic, when instead the Olympics were one of the disease's earliest victims.Let's not forget that Japan will continue to have COVID outbreaks, infections and deaths whether the Olympics go ahead or not. Canceling the Olympics does not mean you cancel the virus. And if the Olympics are not held this summer, what's to say the situation is going to be any better after yet another delay?Japan experienced a second wave of infection in April and May, which has just eased. Peak infections were just as high in January, but the spring wave was thicker and more sustained. Thankfully, the second curve has now come back to pre-spike levels. This second wave had nothing to do with the Olympics but shares air time during media coverage, which links the two in our minds.There's potential for a third wave whether the Olympics take place or not. Our ""availability bias"" encourages us to attribute any future increase in COVID cases to the Olympics, if they go ahead, but the virus is already knocking around in Japan. It is not as if the Olympics would be introducing the disease into virgin territory.The job, and it's a serious one, is to control the Olympics so that they can occur in as much a COVID bubble as possible. The Euro 2020 soccer tournament is currently going ahead, even with the occasional positive test from a player, who is sent home. Wimbledon will hold its final in front of a full center court, according to current plans.Japan, for a country with a 125 million population that is the same size as Mexico, has done an excellent job of curbing COVID-19. Its total infections are on par with Hungary or Jordan, nations that are a fraction of the size. It has kept infections per capita commendably low, at 616 cases per 100,000 people; the rate is 16 times higher in the United States, at 10,082 per 100,000.The thing Japan has not done so well with is vaccination. It is well behind the curve for a nation with one of the world's strongest pharmaceuticals industries. Japan has administered only 20 doses per 100 people, which is below the global average of 31. Only 5.2% of the population is fully vaccinated, compared with 44% full coverage in the United States.That also does not have anything to do with the Games and is a result of slow government rollout. Speed up the vaccination program and the threat of a third wave in Japan will recede. And the Games can go ahead, as the great cultural spectacle and celebration of human achievement that we could surely use right now.",positive,0.91,0.07,0.02,mixed,0.11,0.07,0.82,True,English,,"['ahead', 'cost', 'games', 'infections', 'japan', 'wave', 'billion', 'count', 'japanese', 'supporting', 'foreign', 'public', 'sponsors', 'olympics', 'tokyo']",2021-06-16,realmoney.thestreet.com,EUREX

(Picture: Nomura)The Nomura rooftop garden is home to many species and flowers. (Picture: Nomura)Experts are divided on how the flowers might have arrived there.One theory is that seedlings from the plant were flown in from Saharan dust storms, as the seedlings can reportedly travel great distances by wind.The plants are more commonly found in the Mediterranean basin and Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Portugal, so the ‘Saharan dust’ theory could be an explanation – but it would still be highly improbable.‘The plants could have originated on the continent and been brought over the Channel on southerly winds, which frequently bring Saharan dust deposits to the capital,’ said ecologist Mark Patterson.‘Once settled on the Nomura roof the seeds would have formed a symbiosis with a mycorrhizal fungus enabling them to germinate and grow.’But, Patterson added, ‘while possible, the odds are astronomical.’Another explanation is that the seeds were hiding in the soil brought in to create the garden roof 10 years ago.The small-flowered tongue-orchids haven’t been spotted in the UK for more than a decade (Picture: Getty)Serapias parviflora can take many years to grow and mature when in poor soil conditions, so the seedlings could have been lying dormant until the conditions were right for growth.A factor that might have also contributed to the flowers’ blossoming is the higher temperatures found in London, called the ‘urban heat island’ effect.The tall high-rise buildings found in the City of London ‘trap’ heat, and the climate on top of London’s high-rises can be particularly dry and arid.The flowers, which bloom from March to the beginning of May, is named after the Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis.Strangely, the Nomura roof garden is no stranger to unexpected orchids, as well as being a remarkably biodiverse space.Mark Patterson found London’s largest colony of green-winged orchids in the Nomura garden three years ago, which now form a group of 10 plants.

However, Nomura’s vision was clear from the beginning, when he planned to have an “angry man” as the protagonist.Square Enix Presents debuted our first look at Stranger of Paradise during E3 weekend, and while the project is still in development, it didn’t quite manage to win viewers over.In order to explain the stern-looking lead, the rougher environment in contrast to Final Fantasy’s ethereal past, and the apparent obsession to kill Chaos, Nomura and scenarist Kazushige Nojima shared their thought process.More Stranger of Paradise: Why Fans are Skeptical Towards the FF OriginSTRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN | Announcement Teaser Trailer BridTV 2506 STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN | Announcement Teaser Trailer -utIdWWE/hqdefault.jpg 802612 802612 center 26546Tetsuya Nomura’s Vision of an “Angry Man”Once Stranger of Paradise had been unveiled, Square Enix sent the official Japanese website live, where developers, including Nomura and Nojima, dissected the title’s origin.Nomura explained how Stranger of Paradise was inspired by Dissidia 012 Duodecim, and the savage nature of the fighting game.

In a nutshell, we can see the economic rebound is peaking,"" said Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia, Commerzbank.""The extent of the slowdown in the second half is key. So far, it's still normal and there's still room for the fiscal policy to play a part later in the year.""Most analysts had expected some moderation in May output due to softer export orders, higher input costs for factories and tighter environmental restrictions on heavy industry.Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Pearl River Delta since late May also have brought some key ports to a standstill, economists at Nomura said in a note to clients, though it believes the current spate of infections can be contained in a relatively short period of time.Story continuesFu Linghui, an NBS official, said external risks also remain, such as still rising global COVID-19 infections, an uneven recovery in the world economy and spill-over effects from large stimulus programmes from some countries.BRIGHT SPOTSRetail sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in May, weaker than 13.6% growth expected by analysts and down from the 17.7% jump seen in April.Chinese consumer and business confidence has been picking up thanks to pent-up demand and quickening vaccine rollouts, which are also reviving domestic tourism.Two-year average growth for retail sales stood at 4.5% in May, faster than the 4.3% in April, in a sign that sales are gradually rebounding, Fu from NBS told reporters.Fixed asset investment increased 15.4% in the first five months from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 16.9% rise, slowing from January-April's 19.9% increase.Notably, two-year average growth in manufacturing investment turned positive in May.""What is gratifying is some weak indicators such as consumption and manufacturing investments are showing some improvement,"" Li Huiyong, deputy general manager at Hwabao WP Fund Management Co., adding that he expects the trend to continue.China's unemployment rate also continued to drop. Nationwide urban jobless rate fell to 5.0% in May, the lowest since May 2019, from 5.1% in April.On a month-on-month basis, Capital Economics estimated industrial output growth was unchanged at 0.5%, the pace of investment spending eased slightly and retail sales picked up.However, Reuters calculations showed real estate investmentin May rose at its slowest pace this year as more smaller towns joined bigger cities in trying to curb red-hot housing prices. New construction starts fell for a second month.MIXED BAG?Earlier data for May painted a somewhat mixed picture, with export growth easing but imports picking up, fuelled by surging demand and prices for raw materials.Surging commodities prices pushed China's producer inflation to its highest level in over 12 years, squeezing profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.Bank lending unexpectedly rose but broader credit growth continued to slow, a trend analysts said could start to weigh on activity in the second half of the year.(Reporting by Gabriel Crossley, Stella Qiu; Additional reporting by Roxanne Liu, Editing by Kim Coghill)",negative,0.05,0.38,0.57,mixed,0.2,0.17,0.63,True,English,,"['miss', 'chinas', 'expectations', 'factory', 'retail', 'analysts', 'prices', 'export', 'investment', 'sales', 'growth', 'recovery', 'second', 'rose', 'output']",2021-06-16,in.finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

The banks have been temporarily barred from the lucrative trades as the bloc assesses whether they’ve done enough to fix previous breaches of antitrust rules.The move has the potential to reshape debt league tables for the region, hand hefty fees to smaller competitors and even weigh on bankers’ bonuses. Tuesday’s 20-billion euro issuance by the bloc -- the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction -- may have generated more than $20 million in fees, according to estimates by Bloomberg.Syndications are a “cash cow,” said Liam O’Donnell, head of nominal rates at Aberdeen Standard Investments. It “certainly would have been a profitable environment recently with multiple syndications.”The banks affected are a Who’s Who of global banking with Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UniCredit SpA, NatWest Group Plc, Natixis SA and Credit Agricole SA also barred. Spokespeople for the 10 banks declined or didn’t respond to requests for comment. IFR reported the news earlier.“These banks have to demonstrate and to prove that they have taken all the necessary remedial actions which have been demanded by the Commission when deciding about these cases,” budget commissioner Johannes Hahn told reporters Tuesday. “We now expect the submission of the necessary information and then of course we have to analyze and assess it. I cannot predict how long it takes.”While the exclusion is unlikely to make or break the trading year for most desks, the scale of the missed fees could snowball. Another two syndications are due before the end of July.Story continuesThe EU’s big-ticket transactions account for a large part of banks’ business in the European market for new bond issues this year. The amount of EU bonds that dealer banks have sold this year typically amounts to more than 10% of their transactions in other European bonds, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.This makes it hard to effectively replace the EU as a source of fee revenue in Europe. Even though other issuers may offer a higher fee than the EU’s 0.1% for this maturity, they are nowhere near as prolific in terms of issuance volume.Primary DealersThe 10 banks barred from the syndications are among a list of 39 so-called “primary dealers,” which have a responsibility to bid for bonds during regular debt auctions. The EU is expected to begin those in September.Stopping banks from participating in bond sales is rare, and a first for the EU since it started selling debt in meaningful sizes under its social program last year. Morgan Stanley temporarily lost its status as a primary dealer of French government bonds in August as a result of transactions that took place in 2015.In April this year, Bank of America was among banks fined about 28.5 million euros by European Union regulators for colluding in chatrooms on trading of U.S. supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds. And in May, Nomura and UniCredit were among those fined for colluding on euro government bond trading during the region’s sovereign debt crisis.Investor DemandThe missing banks didn’t seem to dent demand Tuesday with around 142 billion euros of investor orders for the offering. The lead managers for Tuesday’s sale were BNP Paribas SA, DZ Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Morgan Stanley, with Danske Bank A/S and Banco Santander SA hired as co-leads.Despite its hardline stance, the EU offered some hope of a swift resolution to the banks it has excluded -- assuming they satisfy its requirements.It is in the EU’s “interest to include all the key players and banks which have qualified themselves for the primary dealer network,” Hahn, the commissioner, said. “But of course the legal aspects have to be respected.”(Adds superlative in third paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.15,0.13,0.72,True,English,,"['losing', 'european', 'cow', 'bonds', 'trillion', 'banks', 'eu', 'transactions', 'bond', 'ban', 'cash', 'trading', 'primary', 'sale', 'risk', 'bank', 'debt']",2021-06-16,ca.finance.yahoo.com,EUREX

We are looking to extend that network according to our clients’ priorities.”He continued that clearing members run complex businesses, where multiple legal entities are often facing multiple CCPs and acting on behalf of clients, in addition to their own in-house business. Baton allows firms to view all this information in a single dashboard.“We allow firms to see normalised aggregated information on an intra-day basis to allow them to make better decisions,” added Knight.Christopher Giancarlo, Willkie Farr & GallagherBaton was founded in 2016 by technology, payments and capital markets veterans. In April this year J. Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, joined Baton as senior advisor. Giancarlo is currently senior counsel to law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project to advance consideration of a U.S. central bank digital currencyGiancarlo said in a statement: “Baton is enabling a solution that is working today to improve the speed and precision of collateral management.”LCHIn May this year Baton said J.P. Morgan will be the first client to manage their collateral at LCH using its platform. In 2019 Baton and the bank developed a solution that enables the near real-time orchestration of cash and collateral transfers to multiple clearing houses.Baton Systems has integrated with LCH_Clearing to automate the end-to-end collateral workflow for derivatives participants. jpmorgan will be the first of Baton’s clients to manage their collateral at LCH using the Baton platform.  fintech  derivatives — Baton Systems (batonsystems) May 6, 2021Knight said the LCH integration was a really important step in the further development of Baton’s network for automating collateral workflow for cleared derivatives.“Establishing a two-way connection with LCH was very high on the list of requirements from our clearing member clients,” he added.Baton consumes end of day and intra-day data from clearing houses regarding positions, margin requirements and eligibility information. Clearing members’ instructions for the movement of collateral are then integrated back into the CCP by Baton.Anthony Fraser, head of global clearing operations and cost & commission services at J.P. Morgan, said in a statement: “This will bring further efficiency in our collateral management process and will provide greater real-time visibility of our margin and collateral holdings.”Alex Knight, Baton SystemsKnight explained that Baton also allows clearing member firms to see their obligations and the holdings they have at their custodians. In addition, by having up-to-date information on eligibility and concentration limits etc. and data from the CCP on haircuts being applied to assets, the decision making process becomes much more robust.Baton also performs pre-checks with the CCP to determine if the instructions, individually or collectively, will result in a breach and a likely rejection.“By automatically tracking the progress of instructions and collateral movement we provide a huge amount of visibility, flexibility and control to the clearing firm,” Knight added.Clearing firms can also set up automatic alerts or automated collateral movements when certain thresholds are breached so there is straight-through processing for collateral posting with little manual intervention required.MarginsKnight continued that clearing firms often hold excess collateral at CCPs and by having access to better data and being able to respond more quickly, this can be reduced and lead to a material benefit in lowering the cost of funding.“Clearing firms can receive a meaningful uplift in net interest income which has become more important because collateral or margin requirements at the CCPs are now so high,” he said.Clarus Financial Technology, the derivatives analytics provider, said in a blog that initial margin for interest rate swaps remains close to record highs.What’s new in CCP Quant Disclosures – 4Q20?  — Clarus (clarusft) April 14, 2021CCPs publish more than 200 quantitative data fields including margin, default resources, credit risk, collateral, liquidity risk, back-testing under the CPMI-IOSCO public quantitative disclosures.Amir Khwaja, chief executive of Clarus wrote that initial margin for swaps has remained at the record highs from 31 Mar 2020, the Covid-19 crash quarter.“A little surprising that initial margin has not come down given the lower market volatility, but then again the risk position of members at CCPs on 31 December 2020 will not have been the same as on 31March 2020,” added Khwaja.Knight continued that Baton experienced an uplift in interest after the very high volatility last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the operational processes of many firms struggled to keep up because of the manual intervention required. In addition visibility of data was a problem as most firms relied purely on end-of-day reports.“The need to have up-to-date data was really important when firms were scrambling for liquidity,” added Knight. “One clearing member said after the event that they spent many hours cobbling together reports so the benefit of aggregation and seeing data in a consistent, reliable format is huge.”In addition, one of the impediments to scaling a clearing business can be the highly manual processes between the clearing firms and their underlying clients. “That is a space where we can do some great work and we are talking to a couple of our customers,” said Knight.He continued that Baton’s distributed ledger technology means firms can fund their liquidity as efficiently as possible as they can choose to run multiple settlement cycles during the day.“The industry pays hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund liquidity, so trying to help to solve this issue is really key,” Knight added.FXBefore joining Baton Systems, Knight spent 18 years at Citi, where he was most recently global head of sales and client coverage for Citi’s FX Prime Brokerage and had also set up and run the bank’s Asia Pacific FX Prime Brokerage business from Singapore.In January this year 2021 Baton entered into a partnership to combine its payments infrastructure with Cobalt, the foreign exchange and digital asset infrastructure provider, to provide a seamless end-to-end FX settlement solution.Company announcement: Cobalt and Baton Systems partner to streamline post-t…   fintech — Finextra (Finextra) January 19, 2021Arjun Jayaram, chief executive of Baton Systems, said in a statement that the the increased market volatility in 2020 exposed the underlying issues with liquidity, operational infrastructure and settlement that have hindered the industry for decades.“By integrating our real-time payment versus payment FX settlement process with Cobalt we can deliver improved visibility and control over the settlement process to a new segment of the market, eliminating many of the systemic risks currently plaguing the industry,” added Jayaram.",neutral,0.24,0.67,0.09,mixed,0.4,0.08,0.52,True,English,"['Baton Systems', 'LCH', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Baton Systems', 'Markets Media', 'LCH', 'CME', 'Eurex', 'SGX', 'Willkie Farr & Gallagher', 'Baton', 'Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'Willkie Farr & Gallagher', 'Digital', '. central bank', 'Baton', 'LCH', 'LCH', 'Baton Systems', 'LCH', 'Baton', 'Baton Systems', 'batonsystems', 'LCH', 'LCH', 'Baton', 'CCP', 'J.P.

In that context, it is important to assess that EU CCPs, but also Third Country CCPs of systematic relevance to the EU, are resilient as key infrastructures for EU financial stability.”The 2021 exercise will be applied to the 13 CCPs authorised to operate in the EU, along with two UK CCPs classified as Tier 2, notably LCH Ltd and Ice Clear Europe Ltd.With the addition of operational risk, the stress test will now focus on four elements. Credit stress is a measure of a CCP’s ability to absorb losses through a combination of market price shocks and member default. Concentration risk considers the effect of liquidation costs emanating from concentrated positions.ESMA’s reverse credit stress methodology progressively increases the number of defaulting entities, and the degree of shock or liquidation costs, to identify when CCPs resources are exhausted.Finally, its operational risk criteria evaluate risks deriving from shared service provision in the clearing segment and interconnectivity between CCPs.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.03,0.06,0.91,True,English,"['ESMA', 'ESMA', 'ESMA', 'European Markets', 'EU', 'EU', 'ESMA', 'CCP', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'LCH Ltd', 'Ice Clear Europe Ltd', 'CCP', 'ESMA']","['new stress test framework', 'ESMA', 'CCPs', 'European securities markets watchdog', 'Ice Clear Europe Ltd', 'European Markets Infrastructure Regulation', 'new operational risk analysis', 'new stress test framework', 'European Economic Area', 'Klaus Löber', 'market price shocks', 'The 2021 Stress Test', 'previous evaluation exercises', 'shared service provision', 'operational risk criteria', 'CCP supervisory committee', 'Third Country CCPs', 'two UK CCPs', 'credit stress methodology', 'EU financial stability', 'LCH Ltd', 'stress tests', 'risk assessment', 'service providers', 'financial systems', 'evaluation framework', 'Concentration risk', 'central counterparties', 'fourth iteration', 'credit assessment', 'defaulting portfolio', 'first time', 'aggregated view', 'systematic relevance', 'key infrastructures', 'four elements', 'concentrated positions', 'defaulting entities', 'clearing segment', 'third-country CCPs', 'CCPs resources', 'intraday exercise', 'last exercise', 'credit losses', 'EU CCPs', 'concentration costs', 'Tier 2 CCPs', 'ESMA chair', 'liquidation costs', '13 CCPs', '2021 exercise', 'EMIR', 'safety', 'resilience', 'services', 'experience', 'example', 'combination', 'components', 'risks', 'objective', 'disruptions', 'COVID-19', 'Brexit', 'context', 'addition', 'measure', 'member', 'effect', 'reverse', 'number', 'degree', 'interconnectivity']",2021-06-10,assetservicingtimes.com,LCH Ltd

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoNEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - When Brian Moynihan took the reins at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) in 2010, the U.S. bank was reeling.Its former CEO suddenly left as scandals and probes related to a major acquisition unfurled. Its stock price was tanking, and the global financial crisis was still going strong.Since then, Moynihan, 61, has not just righted the ship, but transformed Bank of America, leaving analysts, industry people and some investors wondering what - and who - comes next.Moynihan has no imminent plans to leave, but as his tenure continues, so does the mystery of who will replace him. Candidates who were clear front-runners have grown too old, while those recently promoted to Bank of America's management committee are too fresh-faced.That leaves Moynihan with a new challenge over the next few years: determining who would best replace him, and marketing that person to the world without alienating other senior executives.""Who becomes CEO is not a minor thing,"" said Sydney Finkelstein, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.Moynihan's predecessor, Ken Lewis, left after months of public drama and decisions that resulted in criticism from lawmakers, regulators and investors, Finkelstein noted. Although Moynihan has the bank on much steadier footing, he has been there long enough for constituents to want a road map for the future, Finkelstein said.""You're not going to leave the bank in that same mess,"" he said. ""OK, well, what are you going to do?”Moynihan was not available for an interview, said a spokesperson, who declined to comment for this story.LAST ONE STANDINGIt is not unusual to have leadership voids at companies with relatively fresh CEOs who want to groom deputies over 5-10 years. The situation is less common at companies with CEOs who have been in place for a long time, and have effectively executed their visions, sources said.Of the six biggest U.S. banks, Bank of America is the only one not to have changed CEOs in recent years or outlined a relatively clear succession plan lately. read moreCircumstances are different at each institution. Yet it leaves Moynihan as the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street who has not offered a crisp idea of who is next, analysts said.""Up until now, Brian Moynihan has wanted to see through the changes that he spearheaded,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte. ""But now he has done that.""The perfect successor would be about 45-50 years old now, have experience leading different parts of Bank of America's eight businesses, be comfortable with regulators and understand the bank's social-purpose agenda, said several recruiters.That leaves no obvious internal candidate to succeed him.""Now that he has four or five years of runway left, investors should be rightfully saying, 'Hmmm,'"" said one former bank employee.Bank of America's board takes succession planning seriously and has the topic on its agenda, said a different person who was familiar with the board's thinking. The board met twice last year to discuss the topic.They both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters or avoid professional consequences for speaking to the press.Headhunters mentioned seven Bank of America executives as contenders: Raul Anaya, Dean Athanasia, Cathy Bessant, Steve Boland, Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare and Andy Seig. PNC’s (PNC.N) Mike Lyons and former SunTrust executive Mark Chancy are also possibilities, they said. read moreMoynihan’s No. 2, Tom Montag, could take charge if his boss had to leave immediately. But at 64, Montag is not viewed as a long-term CEO candidate.'RESPONSIBLE GROWTH'Few expect Bank of America to outline a detailed succession plan any time soon, but a prolonged search can be risky because the best people may grow impatient and leave, sources said.Moynihan won his own succession battle partly because of his legal expertise. He spent years resolving hairy regulatory probes and lawsuits, including a $17 billion settlement with the Justice Department in 2014.He also set his sights on cost-cutting and integrating a tangle of businesses that created Bank of America from deals spanning two decades.Moynihan’s strategy helped Bank of America produce a $16.5 billion profit and 6.8% return on equity last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, compared with a $6.8 billion profit and 0.3% return on equity in 2009. Its share price is now about $43, compared with $16 when Moynihan took charge.As the global economy heals from COVID-19 and business picks up, analysts expect the bank to do even better.Investors like Warren Buffett have embraced Moynihan's mantra of ""responsible growth.""

In the runup, Goldman required U.S. employees to inform the company of their vaccination status.Companies across Wall Street and corporate America more broadly have adopted various approaches — some more strict than others — to bringing staff back to the office after the coronavirus pandemic last year prompted an unprecedented adoption of remote work.Some have decided to embrace a so-called hybrid model permanently, requiring workers to come into the office a few days per week. Other companies have gone further, allowing most employees to work remotely full-time even after the pandemic ends.Moynihan noted that certain Bank of America employees such as those at bank branches have long been working in person during the pandemic and ""done a spectacular job.""

Some links on this page — clearly marked — may take you to a partner website and may result in us earning a referral commission. For more information, see How We Make Money.As one of the world’s leading financial institutions, Bank of America has branches located in 38 states but originates mortgage loans across all 50 states in the U.S. It offers a number of different mortgage loans, including refinance, home equity, conventional, jumbo, FHA and VA loans.Customers can begin the mortgage application process by applying online, over the phone, or in person at one of the bank’s branch locations. What makes this lender stand out is its Preferred Rewards program. Preferred rewards members see perks such as discounted mortgage origination fees and discounted home equity interest rates. The price of membership, though, is high. The lowest tier with the lowest rewards starts with a balance of $20,000 in combined Bank of America accounts. This perk makes the company a competitive mortgage lender for those who have high cash flow balances.While the bank’s website does provide a good amount of basic information about the mortgage process, customers who have questions may find it difficult to get a clear answer from lending specialists. Here are a few things you should know about Bank of America before applying.Pros and Cons of Bank of AmericaPros Originates mortgage loans in all 50 statesReduced fees for Preferred Rewards clientsEstimates for rates and fees for mortgage loans available onlineOffers a variety of products, including low down-payment options and housing assistance programs Cons Offices are only located in 38 statesNo fee estimates available online for refinance loansDifficult to get answers to questions if not listed on the websiteBank of America: Loan Types and ProductsBank of America offers a variety of loans for anyone looking to purchase or refinance a home. In addition to conventional and jumbo loans, the bank also offers low down payment programs, FHA and VA government loans, and home equity loans.Here is a list of the mortgage products offered by Bank of America:Customers looking for a loan amount that exceeds conforming limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency may be placed into a jumbo loan program. Conforming loan limits can change each year and are also dependent factors such as property location and property type. Jumbo loans typically have higher interest rates and stricter underwriting rules, so this is something you should consider when thinking about a down payment and loan amount.In addition to offering fixed-rate mortgage loans, Bank of America also offers customers the choice of several adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Available options include a 5y/6m, 7y/6m, and a 10y/6m term. Compared to fixed-rate mortgages, ARMs generally offer a lower interest rate for the first several years, after which the interest rate may be adjusted up or down. For example, with the bank’s 5y/6m ARM, the interest rate remains fixed for the first five years, after which it can adjust every six months.Homebuyers who do not have a large down payment may benefit from the bank’s Affordable Loan Solution and Freddie Mac Home Possible mortgages. Both programs allow for a down payment as low as 3%, and in the case of the Affordable Loan Solution mortgage, it may not require the added cost of mortgage insurance. Qualifying buyers will be subject to certain income and loan limits, which vary based on location.In addition to offering resources for down payment assistance through state and other local agencies, Bank of America also offers its own programs. The America’s Home Grant program offers a lender credit of up to $7,500 that can be used towards certain closing costs and fees, with no repayment required. The Down Payment Grant program offers a grant of up to 3% of the home purchase price (not to exceed $10,000) that can be used as part of the down payment.Government programs, such as FHA and VA loans, are another option for those having difficulty qualifying for a conventional loan. That’s because these government programs offer more flexible qualification guidelines. VA loans require a military affiliation, but for those who are eligible, it is possible to qualify for a $0 down payment loan.Customers looking to borrow against the equity they have built-in their home can take advantage of Bank of America’s home equity line of credit (HELOC) product, which has no application fees, no closing costs, and no annual fee. The interest rate on the HELOC is not fixed, although the bank is currently offering a special introductory fixed rate for the first six months. Interest rate discounts are also available for setting up automatic monthly payments, Preferred Rewards clients, and for making an initial withdrawal when the account is opened. Customers looking for more predictable payments also have the option to convert their variable-rate balance to a fixed-rate loan option.Bank of America TransparencyBank of America allows customers to easily view interest rates online based on a loan amount, down payment, and zip code. The bank’s intuitive website also has basic information about the mortgage loan process. However, getting a clear answer to anything not listed on the website proved to be challenging.Although the bank provides an online calculator to estimate closing expenses for those purchasing a home, customers looking to refinance their home must call a lending specialist during regular operating hours to get a loan estimate. A lending specialist told us that this process requires a hard pull of your credit, as rates and fees can depend on your credit score.Pro Tip Lending officers have varying levels of experience and knowledge. To ensure you are being given the right information to your questions, it’s a good idea to speak with different individuals to see if they provide you with the same answers.The bank does not list the minimum credit scores needed for each loan program. We called the bank multiple times and received ranges from 620 to 660 for conventional loans. It was difficult to get minimum credit score requirements for loan programs other than conventional loans.Bank of America: Rates and FeesCustomers looking to purchase or refinance a home can find interest rates listed on Bank of America’s website for 15-year fixed, 20-year fixed, 30-year fixed, 10y/6m ARM, 7y/6m ARM, 5y/6m ARM, jumbo, and home equity loans. Interest rates may change daily and vary based on a variety of factors, such as your credit score or down payment amount.Fees for refinancing a mortgage are not listed. Instead, customers are instructed to call or submit a formal loan application to get a loan estimate. However, homebuyers can use the bank’s online closing cost calculator to view an estimate of closing costs based on a purchase price, down payment, loan type, and zip code of the property.These closing costs include:Discount pointsLender origination feeAppraisal feeCredit report feeTax service feeFlood certification feeLife of loan flood monitoringTitle endorsementClosing/escrow feeLender’s title insuranceMortgage recording feeOwner’s title insurance (optional)Bank of America states there are no application fees, closing costs, annual fees for its home equity loans. However, an early closure fee may be charged if the HELOC is closed within 36 months. This fee can be as much as $450 plus any closing agent or attorney fees the bank may have paid on your behalf. Otherwise, Bank of America does not charge any prepayment penalty for its FHA, VA, Jumbo, or Conventional mortgage loans.Refinancing With Bank of AmericaExisting homeowners can refinance their current mortgage loan to lower the interest rate, monthly payment, or to take advantage of the equity they’ve built up in their home. Bank of America offers the following refinance options:Rate and term refinanceCash-out refinanceFixed-rate refinanceAdjustable-rate refinanceFHA & VA refinance (only available for existing Bank of America home loan clients)The bank’s website provides information on what to expect during the mortgage refinance process. Customers can read about what steps are involved, what mortgage terms mean, and what documents they should be prepared to provide. Bank of America does not provide an estimate for how long the process can take as they state every home loan situation is different.Preferred Rewards members with Bank of America can qualify for a reduction of $200-$600 in the mortgage origination fee. The amount you qualify for will be based on eligible balances at the time of application. Bank of America does not list what fees are associated with refinancing. To get this information, customers are directed to call one of the bank’s lending specialists during normal operating hours.Bank of America Compared to Other Mortgage LendersBank of America Wells Fargo Loan Depot Minimum credit score Conventional: 620Jumbo: 720FHA: 620VA: 620 620 Conventional: 620Jumbo: 700FHA: 580VA: 620 Minimum down payment Conventional: 5%Jumbo: 20%FHA: 3.5%VA: 0% 0% to 3.5%, depending on the loan program 0% to 5%, depending on the loan program Where does the lender operate?

This may require you to submit a loan application and agree to a hard credit pull, but it also means the lender is committing to a written estimate of loan fees. It can also be useful to consider different types of lenders, such as credit unions, local and regional banks, and online lenders.You’ll also want to make sure that the loan applications you submit contain the same information. This is because rates and fees can vary based on loan amounts, property types, occupancy type, and the down payment. By submitting the same information to each lender, you’ll be able to more easily compare loan estimates.Bottom LineCustomers who have questions will likely need to be very persistent with this bank. Given that we received conflicting information after having called several times, you may want to make sure you get the same answer from multiple lending specialists to be sure you have the right answers to your questions.However, Bank of America can be a good option for wealthy Preferred Rewards clients because of the reduction in the mortgage origination fee charged. Customers with strong credit and few questions about the mortgage process could also do well with this bank. Regardless of what you decide to do, it’s always a good idea to shop interest rates and fees with other lenders before reaching a final decision.",positive,0.92,0.08,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.15,0.37,True,English,,"['preferred', 'refinance', 'fees', 'review', 'payment', 'loans', 'big', 'america', 'rewards', 'mortgage', 'interest', 'conventional', 'bank', 'members', 'lender', 'loan', 'great']",2021-06-10,time.com,LCH Ltd

""This is not ideal for us and it’s not a new normal,"" he said. Faced with the prospect that a second set of summer interns would work virtually, Solomon called the process ""an aberration that we are going to correct as quickly as possible.""At the other end of the spectrum, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in late March that most of her bank’s employees, after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, would work a hybrid schedule to include at least three days a week from the office and as many as two days remote.""This is not just a scheduling exercise; we will be thoughtful about when we ask colleagues to be in the office together,"" Fraser wrote in a memo. ""The pandemic has stretched our capacity for innovative thinking, for solving problems. It has opened doors to new ways of working and shown that we are able to adapt to and even flourish amid adversity.""Other executives have been less bullish toward either end but nonetheless cautiously optimistic.Upon laying out the expectation in late March for a September return, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell told employees: ""We know you have many questions about what this means for you. We will be candid: We don’t have the answers yet. We will spend the next several weeks and months developing them, and we will share our progress along the way.""In the background, the industry heard a steady drumbeat of impatience from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He told wealth-management clients in an April webinar that corporate America may be ""overdoing it a bit"" in its reluctance to return.""A lot of people say, 'I'm not going to go back to work.' Look at their Instagrams,"" Dimon said. ""They didn't get sick from coming into the office. They got sick partying.""He followed that up weeks later, asserting that working exclusively from home ""doesn't work for those who want to hustle. It doesn't work for spontaneous idea generation. It doesn't work for culture.""""Yes, people don't like commuting, but so what?"" Dimon said. ""We want people back at work, and my view is, some time in September, October, it will look just like it did before, and everyone's going to be happy with it.""In the time since those comments, 43.7% of the country has become fully vaccinated, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have both asked employees to come back to work, and Goldman and Wells Fargo have asked staff to report their vaccination status.And the CEOs of the U.S.’s other two largest banks — Bank of America and Morgan Stanley — have broken their relative silence on office returns.""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office and we want you in the office,"" Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman said Monday at a financial services conference organized by the bank.He said the bank had not yet started ""dictating"" when staff should return. Rather, he said, he sent a ""directionally very strong"" message.""[By] Labor Day, I’ll be very disappointed if people haven’t found their way into the office and then we’ll have a different kind of conversation,"" he said.Wells Fargo, incidentally, is also using Sept. 6 as its benchmark for office returns. As is Bank of America.""The idea is the vaccinated teammates should be back to work after Labor Day,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNBC. ""The basic concept is from now to Labor Day or mid-September, you’re kind of in that transition mode.""The bank began asking staff their vaccination status months ago, Moynihan said.""About 60,000 people in the U.S. ... have told us that status,"" he said. ""Now we’re in the process of inviting those people back to work. We give them 30 days-plus notice.""Moynihan said, in his experience, people want to get back to the office. ""I was at this wedding over the weekend and a bunch of young kids working in our industry for a competitor [are] all ... tired of working out of their rooms,"" he said.At his conference, Gorman stressed the importance of the office environment.""[It’s] where we teach, where our interns learn. That’s how we develop people. Where you build all the soft cues that go with having a successful career that aren’t just about Zoom presentations,"" he said, later calling out employees who, after the pandemic, want to work remotely out of state.""If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York,"" he said.Moynihan noted that asking unvaccinated employees to return to the office remains a potentially thorny issue, adding that’s why the focus is first on vaccinated staff.""The key is not to lose track of the virus vaccine path and the virus infection path,"" he said. ""The No. 1 risk to our economy still is that question.""Disclosing vaccination status is voluntary at Morgan Stanley, Gorman emphasized, adding that more than 90% of employees working from the bank’s offices are vaccinated. Gorman said he expects that figure to jump to 98%.",neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,mixed,0.22,0.12,0.66,True,English,,"['relative', 'gorman', 'working', 'silence', 'office', 'employees', 'vaccinated', 'work', 'america', 'told', 'return', 'morgan', 'ceo', 'break', 'stanley', 'ceos', 'bank', 'returns']",2021-06-15,bankingdive.com,LCH Ltd

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoNEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - When Brian Moynihan took the reins at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) in 2010, the U.S. bank was reeling.Its former CEO suddenly left as scandals and probes related to a major acquisition unfurled. Its stock price was tanking, and the global financial crisis was still going strong.Since then, Moynihan, 61, has not just righted the ship, but transformed Bank of America, leaving analysts, industry people and some investors wondering what - and who - comes next.Moynihan has no imminent plans to leave, but as his tenure continues, so does the mystery of who will replace him. Candidates who were clear front-runners have grown too old, while those recently promoted to Bank of America's management committee are too fresh-faced.That leaves Moynihan with a new challenge over the next few years: determining who would best replace him, and marketing that person to the world without alienating other senior executives.""Who becomes CEO is not a minor thing,"" said Sydney Finkelstein, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.Moynihan's predecessor, Ken Lewis, left after months of public drama and decisions that resulted in criticism from lawmakers, regulators and investors, Finkelstein noted. Although Moynihan has the bank on much steadier footing, he has been there long enough for constituents to want a road map for the future, Finkelstein said.""You're not going to leave the bank in that same mess,"" he said. ""OK, well, what are you going to do?”Moynihan was not available for an interview, said a spokesperson, who declined to comment for this story.LAST ONE STANDINGIt is not unusual to have leadership voids at companies with relatively fresh CEOs who want to groom deputies over 5-10 years. The situation is less common at companies with CEOs who have been in place for a long time, and have effectively executed their visions, sources said.Of the six biggest U.S. banks, Bank of America is the only one not to have changed CEOs in recent years or outlined a relatively clear succession plan lately. read moreCircumstances are different at each institution. Yet it leaves Moynihan as the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street who has not offered a crisp idea of who is next, analysts said.""Up until now, Brian Moynihan has wanted to see through the changes that he spearheaded,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte. ""But now he has done that.""The perfect successor would be about 45-50 years old now, have experience leading different parts of Bank of America's eight businesses, be comfortable with regulators and understand the bank's social-purpose agenda, said several recruiters.That leaves no obvious internal candidate to succeed him.""Now that he has four or five years of runway left, investors should be rightfully saying, 'Hmmm,'"" said one former bank employee.Bank of America's board takes succession planning seriously and has the topic on its agenda, said a different person who was familiar with the board's thinking. The board met twice last year to discuss the topic.They both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters or avoid professional consequences for speaking to the press.Headhunters mentioned seven Bank of America executives as contenders: Raul Anaya, Dean Athanasia, Cathy Bessant, Steve Boland, Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare and Andy Seig. PNC’s (PNC.N) Mike Lyons and former SunTrust executive Mark Chancy are also possibilities, they said. read moreMoynihan’s No. 2, Tom Montag, could take charge if his boss had to leave immediately. But at 64, Montag is not viewed as a long-term CEO candidate.'RESPONSIBLE GROWTH'Few expect Bank of America to outline a detailed succession plan any time soon, but a prolonged search can be risky because the best people may grow impatient and leave, sources said.Moynihan won his own succession battle partly because of his legal expertise. He spent years resolving hairy regulatory probes and lawsuits, including a $17 billion settlement with the Justice Department in 2014.He also set his sights on cost-cutting and integrating a tangle of businesses that created Bank of America from deals spanning two decades.Moynihan’s strategy helped Bank of America produce a $16.5 billion profit and 6.8% return on equity last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, compared with a $6.8 billion profit and 0.3% return on equity in 2009. Its share price is now about $43, compared with $16 when Moynihan took charge.As the global economy heals from COVID-19 and business picks up, analysts expect the bank to do even better.Investors like Warren Buffett have embraced Moynihan's mantra of ""responsible growth.""

Learn more about becoming a client.Bank of America customer spending on credit and debit cards and over the Zelle network is 20% higher than the same period in 2019, CEO Brian Moynihan said on CNBC's Squawk Box. All spending categories with the exception of travel—which still remains as much as 15% lower than 2019—have recovered from the spending declines experienced last year, according to Moynihan.Retail sales will reach $6 trillion this year. Insider IntelligenceStimulus payments and improving employment helped kick-start recent growth. Aside from spending on essentials like food and bills, a large portion of funds from the third stimulus payments —which began rolling out in March—went toward paying down personal debt (38%) and savings (25%).This likely helped prime consumers to spend with their cards in the following months. Improving pandemic conditions in the US, propped up by COVID-19 vaccines , also contributed to jobs growth: In April, the US unemployment rate stood at 6.1%—a major recovery from April 2020's 14.8% peak but a far cry from the 3.5% reported before the start of the pandemic. These market factors contributed to the recent volume boost for Bank of America and potentially other issuers—though they'll need to find other avenues to maintain this growth going forward.Opportunities like back-to-school shopping and pent-up older adult spending will likely build on recent growth and help drive issuers' revenues.Back-to-school spending is expected to make a comeback this year. US retail back-to-school sales are projected to climb 9.3% year over year (YoY), compared with last year's 4.6% contraction YoY, per eMarketer forecasts from Insider Intelligence. In 2020, most schools transitioned to remote learning because of the pandemic, but this year, most schools are expected to open up—heralding an uptick in back-to-school sales in categories like apparel and electronics and helping elevate issuer volume. Issuers could develop rewards related to back-to-school shopping that would also help maximize revenue potential.eMarketer forecasts from Insider Intelligence.

Issuers could develop rewards related to back-to-school shopping that would also help maximize revenue potential. Meanwhile, US adults aged 65 and older are gearing up for post-pandemic spending. This consumer group—which held $2.2 trillion in spending power last year, per World Data Lab data cited by Bloomberg—may be eager to get back to pre-pandemic habits, including luxury and travel spending, to make up for 2020. Senior citizen spending will likely support recovery for the US travel sector, which is expected to expand 23.6% compared with last year. Postponed medical procedures from 2020 are also projected to make up a major spending category for older adults this year, per Bloomberg.

Then his website starts charging your bank account on a recurring basis by default, even though you only intended to donate to democracy’s downfall once.AdvertisementBusiness Insider first reported on Thursday that the donation page on Donald Trump’s website for his “Save America” political action committee (PAC) is trying to pull a fast one over on his supporters. The leadership PAC’s donation page automatically ticks two boxes that might go unnoticed while a user is trying to send Trump cash. The first reads, “Submit your name on the Official Founding Member Donor List by making this a monthly contribution!” The second box prompts users who send donations to help “surprise” the former president with a “RECORD BREAKING FUNDRAISING DAY” on his birthday on June 14 by donating the same amount again on that date.Neglecting to uncheck these boxes would triple the amount Trump is able to debit a supporter’s bank account or payment card over the next month. For example, a user who sent in $500 today (June 10) without reading the fine print would be billed $500 again on June 15 and $500 again on July 10, as well as the 10th of every month after that.This is a method that falls under the category of “dark patterns,” a broad umbrella of various technical and UI tricks that website and app operators use to mislead users into authorizing unforeseen or recurring charges, hand over personal data, sign up for contact lists, or any number of other things. Dark patterns are used by everyone from Amazon (making it difficult to stop a Prime subscription) to mobile game developers (making it as easy as possible to keep buying jewels). In this case, the pre-clicked boxes and the “wish Trump a happy birthday” banalities of the text make it easy to miss that the additional donations are opt-out, not opt-in.Anyone who has signed up to a mailing list or even just visited the website of a campaign candidate, political party, PAC, or nonprofit knows that they’ll be hit up for cash—that’s just the nature of the beast. It’s not particularly unusual for them to be annoyingly thirsty, spamming mail, email, and phone lists with frustrating regularity. But Trump’s operation is particularly aggressive even by those standards. Throughout the month of May, according to the Independent, Trump supporters received at least one text a day asking for donations to the “Trump Make America Great Again Committee.” That organization splits funds with the Republican National Committee (RNC), Trump’s Save America PAC, and Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign (which ended 2020 with nearly $10.75 million cash on hand and over $2.7 million in debt, half of it owed to a shell company operated by Trump campaign officials).Despite a disastrous one-term presidency that ended with a devastating pandemic, two impeachment trials, and a failed coup on Jan. 6 that resulted in multiple deaths, Trump has signaled he intends to run for office again in 2024 and isn’t skipping a beat using that as an excuse to gobble up as many donations as possible. Save America PAC was created the day after Trump lost the 2020 elections and raised over $31.2 million by the end of the year, mainly billing itself as a vehicle to fund his long-shot, failed bid to overturn the election results via a series of failed lawsuits (and eventually, the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that resulted in multiple deaths).One likely reason Trump’s team is boosting the PAC, in particular, according to Business Insider, is because it is under no obligation to share funds with the RNC, which distributes funds to Republican congressional candidates. The logic goes that if Trump is able to starve the RNC of funds while building his own war chest, that places him to maintain his considerable leverage over the Republican Party as an institution. That has the additional benefit of ensuring that the funds remain entirely under his control, with little in the way stopping him from dipping into them personally.AdvertisementThe Independent reported Save America PAC’s most recent Federal Election Commission filings showed it has at least $85 million in cash. Although it’s not able to fund Trump’s anticipated 2024 bid directly or pay down remaining debts from his 2020 campaign, both CNN and Business Insider reported Trump could use the funds to pay for himself and allies to host and travel to pro-Trump rallies across the country, pay himself or family members salaries, or throw events at Trump-owned or operated facilities where revenue would flow into his own pockets. This would be entirely legal, Common Cause vice president of policy and litigation Paul Ryan told CNN.",neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,mixed,0.14,0.07,0.79,True,English,,"['donations', 'trump', 'website', 'campaign', 'tricks', 'happy', 'million', 'patterns', 'site', 'america', 'trumps', 'dark', 'pac', 'funds', 'recurring', 'save', 'charges', 'donors']",2021-06-10,gizmodo.com,LCH Ltd

""More than 50% of adults in developing countries do not have a bank account. Digital currencies could substantially reduce transaction costs and allow more economic activities. This would be a major boost to economic growth.""Hauner found that already, emerging market countries where fewer people have bank accounts tend to be more active in bitcoin trading, showing that one of the uses of cryptocurrencies tends to be a substitute for bank accounts. Relative to GDP, the biggest countries in terms of bitcoin trading volumes are all emerging markets: Kenya, Nigeria, Columbia, South Africa, Russia, and Peru.Digital currencies could also reduce cross-border payment costs, he said. The use of central bank digital currencies could formalize the economy, raise tax revenue, and reduce corruption and other illegal activities that often depend on the use of cash payments, Hauner added.However, BofA warns that the rise of digital currencies could undermine a country's physical currency through dollarization and inflation.

In 2019, transfers using traditional money totalled nearly $6 billion - around a fifth of GDP - one of the highest ratios in the world, according to the World Bank.The sharp increase in bitcoin transfers mirrors trends across Central America, the data showed, one of the first glimpses of crypto use in El Salvador.

Some 95% come from Salvadorans working in the United States, it said.Bitcoin, in theory, offers a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional and often costly remittance channels. Yet its relative complexity and lack of infrastructure for converting to dollars is widely seen as hampering its use.While El Salvador sees bitcoin as a useful way for citizens overseas to send funds home, major remittance firms are cautious about offering cryptocurrency services.Separately, ratings agency Moody's said on Friday that El Salvador's bitcoin law may imperil a deal on a funding programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The move ""carries risks for the financial system, the stability of the country's monetary regime and signals a lack of a coherent economic framework,"" Moody's said.The IMF warned on Thursday it had economic and legal concerns over El Salvador’s law, widening spreads on the country’s bonds.Reporting by Tom Wilson Editing by Nick ZieminskiOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,mixed,0.11,0.16,0.73,True,English,,"['small', 'soar', 'el', 'dollar', 'remittances', 'world', 'bitcoin', 'remittance', 'data', 'fraction', 'transfers', 'salvador', 'exclusive', 'traditional']",2021-06-14,reuters.com,LCH Ltd

It recently closed a $12 million fund named Fontes, Latin for fountains, that's earmarked for pre-seed and seed companies in Latin America. The fund is being led by an immigrant-entrepreneur and principal, Ana Cristina Gadala-Maria.The secret to attracting the best founders, Gadala-Maria says, is a deep bench of limited partners who are sourcing deals. The fund's investor base includes more than two dozen successful startup founders from Latin America who refer other entrepreneurs to the firm. Plenty of founders also know the firm's reputation so in other cases, they reach out, she said.""The foundation is being set for this fintech explosion,"" Gadala-Maria said. ""We are excited to be on the forefront.""The venture industry has historically avoided the region because investors just didn't understand the market, Gadala-Maria, who was previously a strategy consultant helping companies better serve their multicultural customers, said.That's no longer the case. The startup scene in Latin America is scaling and venture capitalists are paying attention, as Crunchbase News reporter Christine Hall writes. The total dollars invested in fintech companies in Latin America has increased almost every year since 2016, she reports, and the mix of venture firms participating in deals is also diversifying.They're often drawn by the investment prospects in fintech, which are beating out the incumbent banks by offering lower costs and better customer service, Gadala-Maria said. The region also has a heavily underbanked population.QED has a history of investing in areas that other firms won't touch.The firm was founded by a cofounder of Capital One, Nigel Morris, and his right-hand-man, Frank Rotman in 2008, a rough economic year. They set out to create a venture firm focused on financial services companies. But the firm's strategy was pretty unpopular at the time it was founded. The financial crisis had wiped out trillions of dollars of stock-market wealth, and ""the world of financial services was not exactly attracting a ton of entrepreneurs and a ton of capital,"" Rotman previously told us.The two investors were like ""hammers in search of nails,"" Rotman said. Their persistence paid off.They placed early bets on startups such as GreenSky, SoFi, and Klarna, a Swedish fintech that's now worth $46 billion. Credit Karma, another early investment, had one of the biggest exits in fintech last year with a $7 billion sale to Intuit.Feelings about fintech have changed. The industry is exploding as more people bank and trade from their phones, and banks seek to upgrade their infrastructure. The startups that help them do these things are seeing record investment.Now, the venture firm that made an early bet on fintech is taking another calculated risk in Latin America.A woman walks past Brazilian fintech startup Nubank headquarters, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014, QED made its first investment in Nubank, and its first investment south of the border.Nubank is the most important financial services company most people have never heard of. Based in São Paulo, the financial center of Brazil, the digital bank and credit-card issuer has 40 million users across Latin America. This week, it raised a $750 million mega-round at a $30 billion valuation, launching it into the pantheon of fintechs worldwide.The startup is one of about 25 investments that QED has made in the region. They're mostly concentrated in Brazil and Mexico, Gadala-Maria said, but the firm wants to spread the new fund across Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Peru.Are you a venture-capital insider with insight to share?

Bank of America expects the two companies to continue to make gains.See: Americans are moving, but there’s a ‘notable reversal’ in the types of homes they’re choosingThe home improvement retail category jumped during COVID-19 as consumers invested in making their homes more comfortable and better able to handle the demands of working, playing and much more.Bank of America estimates that 2020 U.S. home improvement sales, including services, reached $767 billion, “equivalent to about the 20th largest economy in the world.”Each year, the average U.S. household spends $3,000 on home projects, according to Bank of America data.Analysts conducted a millennial survey that found that much of the home improvement activity will continue beyond the pandemic. Nearly three-quarters (72%) said they’re likely to buy a home in the next two years.“As a result of a combination of more time at home, favorable household formation trends, and strong household balance sheets, demand for a wide range of home improvement projects has remained at elevated levels over the last year,” Bank of America said.Home Depot sales in 2020 totaled $132.1 billion, and Lowe’s rang up $89.6 billion in sales, making them two of the 10 largest retailers in the U.S.Shares are up 15.6% and 18.8% respectively for the year to date. Both have outpaced the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, which has gained 12.3% over the period.Also: Americans are desperate for furniture, but stores are battling inventory problems. Here’s how to score dealsBank of America identifies a “substantial market opportunity” for the category due to home sales and renovations. Moreover, it’s a category that analysts say is more “consistently profitable.”In a RBC Capital Markets note published around the group’s Global Consumer and Retail Virtual Conference last week, analysts also forecast continued demand in the home improvement category even as consumers head back out for parties, work, restaurant dining and vacations.“Across the presenting companies, management teams called out the lasting effects the pandemic on consumer behaviors leading to more time at home and the potential for structurally higher demand going forward,” RBC wrote.“From Spectrum’s Home & Garden business to Clorox’s Kingsford grilling business, consumers have been investing in their homes and that is unlikely to dissipate with reopening.”RBC rates Home Depot shares outperform. While some may be concerned about “over heating,” RBC says there are notable differences between the home market of today the one from the mid-2000s.Watch: Which sectors stand to win or lose as inflation creeps up“Home equity levels are at all- time highs, consumer balance sheets and confidence levels are strong and speculation (a key driver to the excesses in the 2000s) is relatively low, given significant changes to the financing part of the mortgage market. We also note that home equity usage has essentially dropped for almost 10 years straight, suggesting that consumers have continued to deleverage,” analysts said.“Rather, today’s price appreciation is being driven by good old supply/demand factors.”",positive,0.53,0.44,0.03,mixed,0.54,0.12,0.34,True,English,,"['category', 'lowes', 'rbc', 'trillion', 'retail', 'market', 'america', 'thats', 'share', 'heading', '30', 'sales', 'consumers', 'depot', 'bank', 'improvement']",2021-06-09,marketwatch.com,LCH Ltd

Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement.You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the level of the underlying index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the underlying index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of such index level has increased or decreased, as the case may be. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor fee and other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.Issuer Redemption: If specified in the applicable prospectus, Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to redeem or call a series of ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until and including maturity.Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the U.S. stock markets, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index.Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector, the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments.No Direct Exposure to Gold: THE ETNS OFFER EXPOSURE TO FUTURES CONTRACTS AND NOT DIRECT EXPOSURE TO GOLD OR ITS SPOT PRICES. THESE FUTURES CONTRACTS WILL NOT TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF GOLD. In addition, the nature of the futures market for gold has historically resulted in a cost to maintain a rolling position in the futures contracts underlying each index. As a result, the level of the underlying index, which tracks a rolling position in specified futures contracts, may experience significant declines as a result of these costs, known as roll costs, especially over a longer period. The price of gold will perform differently than the underlying index and, in certain cases, may have positive performance during periods where the underlying index is experiencing negative performance. In turn, an investment in the ETNs may experience a significant decline in value over time, the risk of which increases the longer that the ETNs are held.A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs.No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.Restrictions on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 5,000 ETNs of the same series at one time in order to exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times as set forth in the product prospectus.Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation.The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. There are restrictions on the minimum number of ETNs you may redeem directly with the issuer as specified in the applicable prospectus. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses.The “ Pacer Barclays Gold Trendpilot Total Return Index” and the “ Barclays Gold 3 Month Deferred Index Excess Return” are trademarks of Barclays Bank PLC.© 2021 Barclays Bank PLC.

It's a powerful marketing tool.Barclays and Alliance Data are offering merchants a version of point-of-sale installments.See more stories on Insider's business page.Buy now, pay later was a breakout star in the payments world in 2020, with growth fueled by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce.More than a third of US consumers used a buy now, pay later offering by July 2020, according to Insider Intelligence. It's the fastest-growing category in payments, projected to more than double its market share in North America from 1.6% in 2020 to 4.5% in 2024, according to Worldpay's 2021 Global Payments Report.But as fintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna have grown in popularity and valuation, their strategy has shifted from selling to merchants to trying to win consumers as loyal customers of their own.""They've Trojan-horsed a marketing thing in through the finance department,"" Brian Barth, the founder and CEO of the travel buy now, pay later player Uplift, told Insider.Much more than just another payment option, buy now, pay later services have evolved into consumer-facing companies, keen to establish their own brands.Klarna has a loyalty program of its own, and Affirm recently rebranded in an effort to stand out from competitors and offers its users a high-yield savings account. Afterpay (which also has a loyalty program) was named presenting sponsor of New York Fashion Week, where attendees will be able to purchase outfits they see on the runway directly in the Afterpay app and on its website.But now, banks and credit-card companies are developing ways to allow merchants to both offer point-of-sale financing and maintain the customer relationships themselves.Barclays is one such firm, announcing a partnership with the buy now, pay later software company Amount in April that enables merchants to offer installment plans at the point of sale, under their own brands.Armed with existing credit businesses and balance sheets, banks have the financial resources to manage the buy now, pay later loans. And with Amount's tech, the partnership could prove a compelling case for merchants to keep offering a popular way to pay while holding on to their existing relationship with customers.""Our thesis has always been that banks really should be winning this space,"" Adam Hughes, the Amount CEO, told Insider.Buy now, pay later is a powerful marketing toolFintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna have spent years competing for merchant contracts. Beyond the thousands of small merchants and brands, they've also won deals with big-name retailers like Macy's, Peloton, and Gap.And they've long boasted their ability to convert browsers to buyers and increase average order values for merchants. But now their user bases have grown as valuable as, if not more valuable than, the merchant contracts they've signed.""We are not just a payment provider. We are fundamentally a marketing device for merchants,"" Affirm CEO Max Levchin said on the company's most recent earnings call in May.In 2019, there were 7.3 million buy now, pay later app downloads. In 2020, that number more than doubled to 17 million downloads, according to Insider Intelligence.Affirm says more than 30% of its sales originate on its app and website. Afterpay and Klarna, meanwhile, also have their own apps, and the pair launched loyalty programs in 2020.The growth of these apps represents buy now, pay later players' efforts to become the starting point for every shopper's journey, which increases the chances that a consumer uses their buy button at checkout, thus earning them a fee.Buy now, pay later products, while often interest and fee free to shoppers, come at a cost to merchants. Fees typically range from 3% to 7% of the purchase, higher than the average interchange fees paid on credit-card transactions.For smaller retailers, a buy now, pay later provider might be an attractive way to boost sales and increase conversions, especially if they don't have the tech budget or talent to build out their own buy now, pay later plans.BNPLs are also building out features to help merchants attract customers. In April, Klarna announced a new set of marketing tools for merchants, including social-media content and special offers. Merchants can also buy sponsored placements and content on the Klarna app.But larger merchants that have existing customer relationships might not be willing to give them up to the likes of Affirm or Klarna so easily.""It's the bigger, enterprise accounts that are going to wake up and are waking up,"" Barth said.But some big-name retailers seem happy to partner with BNPLs for the time being. Macy's, for one, signed on with Klarna in October 2020.Early on, the partnership has been a success. With Klarna, Macy's has seen higher spending per visit and increased acquisition of new, younger customers, CEO Jeff Gennette said during the company's first-quarter earnings call this year. Nearly half of shoppers using Klarna at Macy's are under 40.But Gennette also said he sees Klarna as a pipeline to the Macy's loyalty program.""Our goal is to convert all of these new customers to Macy's loyalty customers who return for future purchases,"" Gennette said on the earnings call.White-labeled buy now, pay later offers merchants both payments and loyaltyWhile big merchants might not be happy with the risk of losing loyalty to BNPLs, their options are somewhat limited in offering point-of-sale financing.Building a standalone buy now, pay later button in lieu of partnering with an existing provider is a costly endeavor.It's those merchants that Barclays and Amount are targeting with their new partnership.""If we can deliver the same product that customers want with the same speed and slick integration and digital interface that fintechs provide but can do it in a way that enhances our partners' brand and relationship with their most valuable customers, we think that's a big deal,"" Denny Nealon, CEO of Barclays US Consumer Bank, told Insider.Through its point-of-sale offering, Amount manages origination and servicing, which includes fraud prevention and account management through the life cycle of the loan. The bank uses its own balance sheet and credit-decisioning standards. Retailers are left to decide how they want to present the financing option.Barclays is negotiating the cost of the buy now, pay later feature on an individual basis. Fees will vary based on merchants' existing deals with Barclays and the interest rate merchants want to offer shoppers for the point-of-sale loans, which will be offered only for purchases over $250.""We believe our cost efficiencies; cost of funds and efficient customer service will enable us to be very price competitive in the market,"" Nealon said.Amount's point-of-sale software is customizable, meaning customers can choose to offer interest-free ""pay-in-four"" financing or interest-bearing loans.Spun off from Avant in February 2020, Amount just raised a $99 million Series D, its third fundraise in about a year, pushing its valuation above $1 billion. It's raised more than $240 million to date from investors including Goldman Sachs, QED Investors, and WestCap.Barclays declined to name specific merchants that will adopt the tech but referenced its large network of travel cobrand partners as well as retailers. Across its current partners, which include American Airlines, JetBlue, and most recently, Gap Inc., 80% of new customers come through those brands' own channels versus Barclays.What sets Barclays apart here, Nealon said, is its comfort with working behind the scenes.""We are indifferent to what brand is used with this product,"" Nealon said. ""Many of our partners I expect will be utilizing their brand because they want to use it as a means to extend their relationship with their customer.""And Barclays isn't the only one looking to give merchants an in-house buy now, pay later option.Bread, a white-label buy now, pay later startup, was acquired by Alliance Data, a leader in the cobranded and private-label-card industry, in October 2020.Similar to Barclays and Amount partnership, Alliance's Bread powers RBC's PayPlan product, offering Canadian merchants customizable point-of-sale financing solutions.Focusing on integrating buy now, pay later services into merchants' existing credit offerings sets the company apart from other buy now, pay later players, Val Greer, EVP and chief commercial officer of Alliance Data Card Services, told Insider in emailed comments.""This approach avoids sending customers to a third-party site and creates a seamless experience, an important distinction compared to other providers,"" Greer said.Travel is the latest target for buy now, pay laterThe travel industry is perhaps the best example of a market that values and protects its customer loyalty programs.

"" … In March of this year, we tripled the size of our overweighting and it's now our largest developed market overweighting, a really high conviction view and a perfect demonstration of what we like at a global level.""On May 28, Goldman Sachs released a research note highlighting that the UK market was in a sweet spot given how inexpensive it looks relative to global equities, as well as historically. But regional capital flows don't reflect that, at least not yet.A graph of regional cumulative flows from a Barclays May 26 research note BarclaysInsider spoke to Callum Abbot, a JPMorgan Asset Management portfolio manager, who co-manages a number of the firm's UK funds, to understand what makes the market cheap, but also attractive.Abbot, who oversees the firm's flagship $2.3 billion UK equity fund, also shares how investors can play this rare opportunity.What makes the UK market attractive?""There's not many times you get to buy a market as cheap as this one with a really strong recovery story,"" Abbot said. He shares four reasons why the UK market is attractive right now.Callum Abbot, a JPMorgan portfolio manager JPMorgan1) It's cheapValuations are well below those for the global market. Abbot noted the UK market trades at around a 35% discount compared to the MSCI world index.One example is the comparison between US oil company Exxon Mobil (XOM) and the London-listed rival Royal Dutch Shell (RYDAF), Abbot said.There is very little difference between the two companies in terms of their business model, yet Exxon trades, on balance, at an 80% premium to Shell, Abbot said.""It's just all about where it's listed and that's an extreme example,"" Abbot said. ""But I think that UK stocks consistently trade at a big valuation discount to peers listed in other markets, which looks unsustainable, so I think that's a big opportunity for investors.""2) Strong economic environmentThe UK has rolled out its COVID-19 vaccines at breakneck speed with huge success. The promise of an earlier reopening with strong economic growth looks positive for domestic stocks, especially as many UK consumers are now ready to spend on anything from vacations to homes.3) Opportunity to get in earlyAlthough Abbot would like to see higher flows into UK stocks and funds, the current weak flows relative to other markets creates an opportunity for investors to get in early, and capture most of the upside.4) Strong M&A activityThe cheap valuations in the UK market are creating a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions both from private and strategic buyers.Activity is already picking up and Abbot suspects it will continue, as more buyers recognize they are past the worst of the pandemic and become more confident to do deals.So, why are investors not taking advantage of this?One of the reasons investors have been slow to move the UK market is because growth investing has been hugely rewarding for a decade, Abbot said.A similar statement was echoed in a recent Insider interview with Janus Henderson's director of European equities, John Bennett.Signs of a regime shift have only started to show in recent months, as market-based interest rates have slowly started to rise, more inflation is coming into the system and strong economic growth is beginning to take hold.""I think there is good reason to believe that we are in a new environment, it just takes time for people to make allocation decisions,"" Abbot said.Areas of opportunityAnd while it's been frustrating not to see the flows Abbot would expect in the UK market, it does create some great opportunities for investors willing to take the plunge.""This just strikes us as a great opportunity to buy a market that's been beaten up, it's been unloved, no denying that, but actually sometimes investing against the consensus is where the best opportunities are,"" Abbot said.Abbot breaks down four areas of opportunity in the UK market.",negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,mixed,0.58,0.08,0.34,True,English,,"['abbot', 'soar', 'strong', 'uk', 'overseeing', 'market', 'opportunity', 'jpmorgan', 'stocks', 'thats', 'stock', 'flows', 'portfolio', 'growth', 'unloved', 'set', 'picks', 'investors']",2021-06-09,businessinsider.com,LCH Ltd

The Lightning eliminated the Islanders in six games in the Edmonton bubble in September.The Islanders last reached the NHL’s final four in consecutive seasons when they made it six straight seasons from 1978-79 through 1983-84, a span in which they won four Stanley Cups.The series clincher at home was the second in 14 days for the Islanders, who are in their second “last” season at the Coliseum.The team vacated the Coliseum following the 2014-15 season for Barclays Center in Brooklyn but returned in December 2018 as UBS Arena was being built on the Nassau/Queens border. New York is scheduled to begin play there in the fall.Prior to beating the Pittsburgh Penguins to close out Game 6 of a first-round series May 26, the Islanders hadn’t clinched a series at the Coliseum since April 1993.Travis Zajac scored in the first, Kyle Palmieri capped the second-period outburst with another goal off a turnover, and Cal Clutterbuck and Ryan Pulock scored empty-netters in the final minute of the third for the Islanders, the fourth seed in the East. Goalie Semyon Varlamov made 23 saves.Brad Marchand scored a pair of power play goals for the third-seeded Bruins, who were eliminated in the second round for the second straight season. Tuukka Rask also recorded 23 saves.Zajac put back a rebound of Noah Dobson’s shot from the blue line to give the Islanders the lead 8:52 into the first. The Bruins then had back-to-back power plays -- during which the crowd chanted “New York Saints” in response to Boston coach Bruce Cassidy’s statement Monday that the Islanders drew fewer penalties because they present themselves as saints -- and tied the score on the second one, when Marchand sent a shot beyond Varlamov’s glove with 2:24 left.Nelson began the second-period surge by poking his stick between Matt Grzelyck’s legs, stealing the puck and beating Rask with a shot off his leg at the 5:20 mark.Later, Rask’s clearing pass from behind the Bruins’ net clipped off Mike Reilly and went to Josh Bailey, who fed Nelson for a backhanded goal with 7:21 left. Then, Grzelyck’s attempt to clear a rebound was picked off by Palmieri, who jabbed the puck home with 3:53 remaining.Marchand added another power play goal 5:38 into the third, 18 seconds after Matt Martin was whistled for tripping, but the Bruins didn’t mount another serious threat.--Field Level Media",neutral,0.05,0.87,0.08,mixed,0.29,0.05,0.66,True,English,,"['bruins', 'nhl', 'play', 'islanders', 'isles', 'scored', 'power', 'past', 'series', 'season', 'big', 'semis', 'york', 'shot', 'period', 'second', 'carries']",2021-06-10,reuters.com,LCH Ltd

About 30% of its 6,000 London staff are currently filing into the London office, where workers are tested twice a week by more than a dozen on-site medical staff. Plans to further boost office attendance at the US investment bank are now in doubt following the UK government’s delay.NatWest, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were also expected to bring more staff in from next week but are now prepared to tell employees to wait until work from home orders are lifted.The prime minister’s announcement on Monday evening came as an official study showed that company bosses are more keen than their staff for a return of workers to UK offices after the Covid-19 pandemic.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said more than a third of people working from home – 36% – thought they would keep the arrangement for most of the week. However, there is less enthusiasm among managers, with as few as 24% of companies planning to use increased home working in future.Based on the answers of thousands of workers and businesses surveyed by government statisticians in the past two months, the study signalled that a high degree of uncertainty still remains as employers weigh up their options. More than a quarter of firms still do not know what they will do.According to the snapshot from the ONS, more flexibility for workers is expected in future, amid a sharp rise in online job adverts where home working is mentioned. But while the pandemic has accelerated remote-working practices, the early survey evidence suggests it will remain in the minority.Most people did not work from home during the pandemic, according to the figures, despite a larger proportion in London and the south-east, in IT and professional jobs, and in high-paying roles working remotely.The proportion of working adults who did any work from home rose to 37% on average last year from 27% in 2019. While this figure fluctuated in line with lockdown restrictions, most people continued to travel to work.Show moreSeparate figures from the AlphaWise research unit of Morgan Stanley show British workers have increasingly been spending more time at their desks in the past few months. Reflecting a gradual return to work after lockdown, UK office-based staff were spending almost half (46%) of their time at their usual workplace in late May, the highest level in six months.Most UK employees expect to return to their workplace during August, compared with an average expectation of mid-July in the five countries surveyed. AlphaWise said office workers across Europe want to continue to work from home for on average two days a week. On average, UK workers would like to work remotely for roughly half of the working week, 2.3 days, slightly higher than in Europe.Although British workers have started returning to offices in greater numbers, the research showed the UK still lags behind France, Germany, Italy and Spain for office-based staff returning to their usual workplace.According to the ONS, as many as 85% of staff currently working from home want a “hybrid” approach of both office and home working in future. Businesses also expect to use such practices in future but expect most of their staff to be in the office.Higher-income workers are more likely to expect they will continue with a hybrid mix of working from home and the office in future compared with lower-paid staff. Younger workers expect to return to their normal place of work sooner than older employees. IT and communications businesses are most likely to offer home working in future.Hugh Stickland of the ONS said: “While many workers clearly prefer working from home, today’s research suggests their bosses remain unconvinced. Clearly, it is much easier to work from home when offering IT support than it is when running a cafe, which is virtually impossible.“However, the increased mentions of home working in jobs adverts shows at least some employers coming around to the new normal.”",neutral,0.24,0.59,0.17,mixed,0.19,0.15,0.66,True,English,,"['ons', 'expect', 'city', 'working', 'banks', 'office', 'easing', 'uk', 'work', 'workers', 'plans', 'week', 'returntowork', 'hit', 'return', 'delay', 'staff', 'lockdown']",2021-06-14,amp.theguardian.com,LCH Ltd

The firm’s ambition is to serve around 40.Life planningKidd told International Adviser: “EQ Financial Planning was born from a meeting I had with a life planner in early 2020.“A life planner is someone who looks at what is important to you using a programme called Evoke. The only area of my life I was dissatisfied and disconnected from was work. I was working at a place where it felt to me the client wasn’t at the centre of everything; and that’s essential.“There were many hundreds of clients and only four advisers; the time to do the job properly wasn’t there. It was also a case of we do things this way and you need to fit in with us. So, after being ‘life planned’, I went through the training programme and am now one of 600 people globally who are trained registered life planners.“I am also taking a financial coaching course with Catherine Morgan and will qualify early next year as a financial coach and I will also be offering financial therapy for those who have experienced trauma that affects their relationship with money and what they use it for. My wife, Dr Anna Walton, will be the qualified specialist for this work when its needed.“EQ is a firm where people can come and engage and it’s never about the money first. Most firms vetting process will ask you what you have in terms of assets. To go through Evoke, you don’t need assets.“You may have them and we do get to that stuff. By training to be a coach, I am looking at my own way to bridge the ‘advice gap’, where people can work off hourly rates and not percentages of the assets held. I am not tied to any particular way of working or charging and that is why the company needs to stay small; to allow that fluidity.”",neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,mixed,0.23,0.14,0.63,True,English,,"['exbarclays', 'serve', 'wealth', 'financial', 'planning', 'uk', 'sets', 'life', 'work', 'clients', 'firm', 'way', 'advice', 'planner']",2021-06-16,international-adviser.com,LCH Ltd

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsNEW YORK – The updates, though separated by hours, felt breathless. James Harden’s hamstring was improving as Tuesday progressed and after working around the court with three-pointers and floaters, the former league Most Valuable Player was cleared to return to play for the Brooklyn Nets in Game 5 against the Milwaukee Bucks.Surprising as it was for most, and inspiring as it could have been to the hosts, it was on the tail of Kevin Durant’s comet that the Brooklyn Nets rallied from a 17-point third quarter deficit to beat the Bucks, 114-108, at the Barclays Center.The Bucks now head back to Fiserv Forum on Thursday facing elimination in Game 6.Get daily updates on the Packers during the season.Per the Elias Sports Bureau, the Game 5 winner claims the series 82% of the time (73–16) after the home team had won each of the first four games. If that Game 5 winner was also the home team, they win 91% of the time (60–6).Durant played every minute of the game and was transcendent, even by his standards.He made 16 of his 23 shots, including 4 for 9 from behind the three-point line and scored 49 points. He pulled down 17 rebounds, handed out 10 assists, had three steals and two blocks. He became the first player in NBA playoff history to record 45 or more points, 15 or more rebounds and 10 or more assists. Per Stat Muse, he scored or assisted on 43 of the Nets’ final 52 points.“Oh man, I don’t know man,” Antetokounmpo said when asked what else the Bucks could do to slow down Durant. “Just keep making it tough. Obviously one of the best scorers to ever play the game. It’s tough. It’s tough. He’s the best; he’s the best player in the world right now and we gotta beat him as a team. We gotta guard him as a team, we gotta make him make tough shots, like tonight. And we just gotta keep doing our job and hopefully he’s going to miss.”BOX SCORE: Nets 114, Bucks 108RELATED: Bucks-Nets Game 6 tickets: Plenty of seats available at Fiserv ForumMilwaukee, on the other hand, lost its feel for team offense and drifted back into the same isolation-type situations leading to turnovers and one shot, helping Durant not just score on his own but finally lift the supporting Nets players. When Jrue Holiday assisted on a Brook Lopez three-pointer to make it 74-57 Bucks at the 7:09 mark of the third quarter, it was the team’s 12th assist on 28 baskets.By the time the Nets held a 99-98 lead with 5:10 to go, the Bucks had only three more assists. They finished with 18 assists on 41 baskets.“There were times where it was basket for basket and things, you know, they executed,"" Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""At the end of the day they made one shot from 35, 40 feet that was a three. We had a couple looks that we just didn’t convert. Foul a couple times. So, there’s, I think, (18 assists) is not enough but there’s also some opportunities. You make one or two more shots and its 25, 27, 28 and it’s a basket for basket game.”Though Durant played the role of Thanos in the final minutes, the Bucks had plenty of chances to reclaim the lead game as the Nets never led by more than four points. Instead, Jrue Holiday stepped back from 17 feet on Harden and airballed it down, 97-96. The Nets responded with a three-pointer.Holiday took it to Harden later to tie the game 104-104, but then Giannis Antetokounmpo settled for a 12-footer over Harden. He missed, and Harden hit two free throws on the other end to put the Nets up, 106-104.Durant hit a leaning, shot-clock beating three around Khris Middleton to make it 109-105 with 50 seconds left, but a quick dunk by Lopez made it 109-107.Then, after P.J. Tucker put on the iron glove and held Durant to a contested missed three with 27 seconds left, Middleton’s tight dish to Antetokounmpo fell out of his hands with 13 seconds left and it was Durant who scooped up the loose ball.""Just wasn't able to get my two hands on it,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Great pass by Khris. I messed up on that play.""And it was Durant who secured the rebound on an Antetokounmpo missed free throw with 12.5 seconds left.“Just got a little stagnant,” Holiday said of the team's second half offense. “When it comes down to it, we still had some time to make some plays and try to command the game, try to get the momentum on our side. I feel like we had some good looks, they didn’t fall but we still had an opportunity.”And it was Durant who iced it with three free throws.“Tuck, Khris, Jrue, these guys are doing a fabulous job and he still goes for 49,"" Budenholzer said of Durant. ""Give him credit. I don’t think it was easy. We gotta look at everything but he had to work for it. We just gotta figure out how to get to Game 6 and win at home.”Jeff Green helped his Brooklyn teammate with 27 points on 8-of-11 shooting (7-for-8 from behind the three-point line) off the bench, and Blake Griffin scored 17. Harden finished with five points on 1-of-10 shooting (0-for-8 from distance).Antetokounmpo fouled out with seconds left with 34 points and 12 rebounds. He made 14 of his 22 shots, including two, three-pointers on four attempts. He made 4 of 7 free throws, and 2 of 4 in the final 74 seconds when fouled intentionally.Holiday (19 points, 8 assists), Middleton (25 points), Lopez (10 points, six rebounds) also reached double figures for the starters. Tucker was scoreless on three shots in 33 minutes, and he sat a chunk of the fourth quarter late with five fouls.The Bucks opened the second half with a 16-point lead, which the Nets shaved down to six by the end of it as Durant scored 11 points and handed out five assists, forcing the Bucks to nurse an 87-81 lead into the fourth quarter.But the comeback didn’t begin in earnest until five minutes had gone in the quarter, as the Bucks led 74-57 after a Lopez three-pointer at the 7:09 mark. Brooklyn took a 21-13 advantage over the final six minutes.It was a completely different story in the first half, even though Harden’s introduction got the Nets faithful fired up. Because at the outset, Holiday smothered it.Clearly limited, Harden managed two shots in the first quarter and went 0 for 6 in the first half, including 0 for 5 from beyond the three-point line with Holiday defending him. The Bucks shot out to a 12-2 lead and took a 59-43 lead into the break.Even though Holiday (three), Antetokounmpo (two), Lopez (two) and Tucker (two) were beset by foul trouble and forced head coach Mike Budenholzer to play matchups with his bench, the Bucks’ defense never cracked in holding the Nets to 35% shooting (14 for 40) overall and 27.3% from behind the three-point line.Pat Connaughton played 17 of 32 minutes in the first half, scoring eight points and pulling down four rebounds while Forbes played 10 minutes and scored five points. Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Eli Bryant also saw time.Despite the stops and starts due to fouls, Holiday score 10 points and handed out three assists in the first half, including eight points and an assist in the opening 7:30 that saw the Bucks take a 19-9 lead. Antetokounmpo was dominant in the half, making eight of his 11 shots for 17 points. He pulled down seven rebounds and blocked two shots. Middleton scored 14 timely points, despite shooting 4-for-12.Durant scored 18 points on 6-of-10 shooting, pulled down nine rebounds, had three assists, two steals and two blocks but only Green (15 points) seemed up for the task of running with the star. The other seven Nets who played in the first half scored a combined 10 points, with Harden, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Nic Claxton and Mike James going scoreless.After falling behind by double-digits early the Nets cut it to 24-15 with just over a minute left in the first quarter, but Lopez and Middleton scored five straight points to give the Bucks a 29-15 lead going into the second quarter. Middleton opened the second quarter with a three to make it 32-15 and it took the Nets nearly five minutes to get it 42-33. But Antetokounmpo shouldered the burden then, hitting an open three-pointer to start a run of seven straight points that made it 49-33. The Nets couldn’t get closer than 12 before the half.Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

That is equivalent to a yield of about 0.10% according to Reuters calculations.The bond will raise 10 billion euros, France's junior minister for European affairs said on May 31.The EU has said it expects to issue 80 billion euros of long-term debt this year.After the inaugural deal, the EU will sell two more bonds via syndication - where a borrower hires banks to sell the debt directly to end investors - by the end of July.The EU will then launch a bill programme for short-dated borrowing that will be placed from September via auction, the more common way governments raise debt.The bloc hired BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo and Morgan Stanley as joint lead managers for the debut deal earlier on Monday, while Danske Bank and Santander will act as co-lead managers, according to an earlier memo. read more(Clarifies in para 8 that 80 billion euros of debt is long-term)Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli; editing by Dhara RanasingheOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.08,0.13,0.79,True,English,,"['european', 'deal', 'backing', 'billion', 'eu', 'euros', 'bond', 'according', 'starts', 'lead', 'sale', 'recovery', 'investors', 'fund', 'debt']",2021-06-14,reuters.com,LCH Ltd

Further extensions of the network are likely.The German company is following the strategy adopted by rivals, such as Spain's Telefonica, which have struck similar deals with investors to help pay for network upgrades.Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bank and the prospective bidders all declined to comment.At the same time, the German telecoms giant is kicking off the sale of its T-Mobile Netherlands business to cut its debt and free up cash for investment in infrastructure.FOREIGN INVESTORSDeutsche Telekom is a laggard when it comes to fibre as it bet on improved copper cables to supply internet connections and only switched to focusing on faster fibre cables in 2019.Its move is part of a trend among German companies of turning to foreign investors to fund parts of the infrastructure that keeps the wheels of industry whirring, such as energy.Power network 50Hertz, for example, is now majority owned by Belgium's Elia while gas-power firm Open Grid Europe is part-owned by Australian investor Macquarie.Investment by China, however, is viewed sceptically. When China's State Grid wanted to take a stake in 50Hertz in 2018, German state lender KfW prevented the move.Fibre networks are typically financed with 30% equity and 70% debt and Deutsche Telekom is looking for investors to contribute half of the equity with it providing the rest.Telefonica struck a deal in October 2020 with German insurer Allianz to develop a fibre optic network in Germany for 2.2 million households in a project valued at 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion).Assuming a similar valuation, Deutsche Telekom's project to supply about 4 million households would be worth some 10 billion euros, meaning investors would need to contribute 1.5 billion euros, or half of the 30% equity.At its capital markets day in May, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges underlined the company's commitment to accelerating the rollout of fibre in Germany, taking it from 600,000 households last year to 2.5 million in 2024.He said the company plans to invest 2.5 billion euros a year in fibre infrastructure.DUTCH MOBILE SALEDeutsche Telekom's plan would still leave it trailing countries such as Spain and Sweden, where more than 60% of homes already get their internet via fibre cables. In Germany, only 5% of homes have fibre, slightly lower than Italy.Deutsche Telekom executive Dominique Leroy has said its goal is to reach 10 million households with fibre by the end of 2024 and that it would seek partnerships where it makes sense.While Deutsche Telekom is preparing to invest billions, it is also faces a large bill to exercise options to raise its holding in T-Mobile U.S. to more than 50% from 43%.However, it is already saddled with 130 billion euros of debt and is now selling businesses to reduce the pile.First in line is its subsidiary T-Mobile Netherlands, which is estimated to be worth up to 5 billion euros. The Dutch mobile business has 6.8 million customers and its sales last year came to 1.9 billion euros.Deutsche Telekom's adviser on the deal, Morgan Stanley, has sent out first information packs to prospective bidders asking for offers by the end of July, people familiar with the process said.Suitors including buyout groups KKR, EQT and Warburg Pincus are expected to take part, as is French telecoms entrepreneur Xavier Niel, the people said.Warburg Pincus, which employs former Deutsche Telekom CEO Rene Obermann, came close to buying the business in 2015.Morgan Stanley and the potential bidders all declined to comment.Once that sale is out of the way, Deutsche Telekom may look to sell its telecom towers division, the people said, adding that while conversations with banks are taking place no decision has been taken.

VC Fuel was founded by Ahmad Atwan, who spent the first two decades of his career as a successful entrepreneur and investor in the energy industry.VC Fuel will provide early stage and growth capital to companies across the energy transition space, including but not limited to renewable fuels, carbon capture and storage (CCUS), electric vehicles and electrification, clean agriculture, hydrogen, sustainable manufacturing, and energy efficiency. Its sister fund, VC Infrastructure, will provide the capital necessary to build the infrastructure that is needed to bring companies funded by VC Fuel, as well as others, to scale.Prior to founding VC Fuel, Atwan helped build an energy technology company and founded a renewable fuels company, both of which were sold at attractive returns to investors. In addition, he most recently served as a Managing Director and energy sector leader at BlackRock and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners.Founder and CEO of VC Fuel, Ahmad Atwan, remarked, ""While there has been a proliferation of capital that has entered the energy transition sector, to date there is no investment firm capable of investing in the earlier, venture capital stages of development and helping provide the necessary capital required to scale through infrastructure financing. This disconnect led to failure of many renewables firms during what is commonly referred to as Cleantech 1.0 during the late 2000s. VC Fuel aims to be a pioneer in providing this integrated offering to companies seeking financing when it's most needed.""Atwan continued, ""We aim to invest in companies that at scale can remove 500 million tons of carbon per year, which is roughly equivalent to 1% of global carbon emissions. We believe this ambitious decarbonization goal goes hand in hand with making highly profitable, sustainable investments.""VC Fuel has already invested in four companies across its target energy sectors. One such investment is Hardee Fresh, the country's only certified organic vertical farming company, which is also an industry leader in decarbonization and sustainability. Through multiple investment rounds in Hardee Fresh, VC Fuel demonstrated its unique ability to support companies throughout each growth stage.""VC Fuel invested in Hardee Fresh in its first round of financing, and subsequently led an investment round that helped bring our company to scale,"" said Halton Peters, President of Hardee Fresh.

Instead, they kicked the can five years down the road and agreed a ceasefire, with something of a bitter aftertaste because multi-billion-dollar tariffs could well kick back in if trust breaks down between Washington and Brussels on what subsidies are being paid.While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen celebrated the five-year ceasefire as a key moment in putting the transatlantic relationship back on track after the bruising Trump years, the terms of the ceasefire are a sign of how intractable many of the disputes between Washington and Brussels are.Both Biden and von der Leyen want to make a public show that Europe and America can now unite and confront China, but the transatlantic feuds are proving hard to resolve definitively.Beyond the aviation subsidies, an even bigger unresolved problem lies in the duties that former U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on steel and aluminum. Not wanting to alienate America's steelworkers, Biden is in no hurry to unwind these, even though the EU protests that there is no justification for them on the grounds of national security, as Trump claimed. Other transatlantic difficulties range across topics from data transfers and green taxation.While von der Leyen said the airplane deal showed ""our transatlantic partnership is on its way to reaching cruising speed,"" U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai threatened the EU that there would still be trouble if Europe poured too many subsidies into Airbus.“Should EU support cross the red line, and U.S. producers are not able to compete fairly and on a level playing field, the United States retains the flexibility to reactivate the tariffs that are being suspended,” Tai told reporters.This is not the conclusive endgame that many — particularly those in industry — had wanted. Tuesday's deal established broad guidelines for behavior rather than ending the case with absolute legal certainty. This raises the danger that the parties could cross swords again over transparency of payments to aircraft makers and over what types of subsidy will be allowed.Subsidy scrapMuch of the discussion over the past weeks centered on subsidy transparency and on whether France, Germany and Spain should be allowed to continue granting Airbus “repayable launch investments” — effectively credits to develop new airplane models, under which Airbus pays back more or less money, depending on how successful the new model is.Until now, France, Germany, the U.K. and Spain have not published details of contracts under which they grant Airbus “repayable launch investments.” But they argue that Washington also grants indirect aid to Boeing under secret defense contracts.That discussion over what kind of subsidies are permissible will now happen in a working group on large civil aircraft, led by each side’s minister responsible for trade. In a not-so-subtle nod toward an alliance against China, the two sides will also work together on “jointly analysing and addressing non-market practices of third parties that may harm our large civil aircraft sectors.” Biden said this framework could be translated to other sectors under pressure from China. ""It’s a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China’s economic model,"" he said.Still, regardless of the failure to draw a definitive line under the Airbus-Boeing dispute, Tai said her confidence in relations with Europe was ""very high as of today.""Back in Washington, though, senior U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady, Republican leader on the House Ways and Means Committee, made clear that the EU should still see itself at risk of retaliatory duties, which have in the past hit targets ranging from wine to cheese. ""Rather than replace these unfair subsidies with new ones, the EU must hold firm to its long overdue commitment to remove them — or else face reimposition of WTO-authorized tariffs,"" he said in a statement.That doesn't sound exactly like peace.“The fact that negotiators agreed only a five-year truce shows that there are still clear underlying differences, which both sides could not bridge in time,” said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament’s trade committee.The other, more inflammatory, transatlantic trade dispute — on EU steel and aluminum — will be even harder to resolve. That has got nowhere near a resolution. Instead, the EU and U.S. have set up a ""working group"" to try to resolve their differences within a six-month deadline.EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis has urged Biden to ""walk the talk"" on his trip to Europe and drop the duties.Beijing-Brussels allianceMore worryingly, additional trade conflicts are already brewing on the horizon, over the EU’s plan to tax imported emissions and Biden’s promise to toughen protectionist ‘Buy American’ laws to favor domestic champions.Fundamentally, the EU and U.S. have drifted apart on key economic and geopolitical questions, from digital privacy to how to tackle climate change and China. Trump's trade wars have highlighted a trend that was already well underway under his predecessors: The EU and U.S. have developed into two different systems, which will keep creating frictions.For all the talk about jointly tackling China in the trade arena, the EU has done the opposite in Geneva, where it has teamed up with Beijing to isolate Washington. After Washington blocked the World Trade Organization’s top trade court, the EU circumvented the U.S. in Geneva by launching a parallel court of which the EU, China, Canada and others are members, but the U.S. isn’t.On the tech front, Biden wants to secure a political agreement with Brussels to restore confidence in data flowing across the Atlantic. But Europe's highest court has struck down previous transatlantic data transfer agreements that underpin billions of dollars in EU-U.S. digital trade, arguing that the wide-ranging U.S. spying powers for its intelligence agencies mean EU citizen’s data are not sufficiently protected.Brussels is now asking Washington to rein in its agencies to strike a new data transfer deal.A joint EU-U.S.-Japanese initiative to toughen limits on industrial subsidies at the WTO also failed, because the EU wanted to preserve “domestic policy space” to subsidize its industrial champions.Climate is another thorny issue. The U.S. doesn’t have a carbon pricing system, and is no fan of the EU plans for a carbon border levy that would tax imports of steel, aluminum, cement, fertilizer and electricity. While Biden would like to introduce carbon curbs similar to Europe's, opposition in Congress means he will more likely have to impose regulatory limits rather than a fully-fledged carbon tax.But the most significant long-term disagreement is over how to handle China. While U.S. is betting on more decoupling in key tech sectors, the EU doesn’t want to give up on what’s become its second-largest export market for German cars and French luxury products, and generally a major production base.The EU rushed to strike an investment deal with Beijing at the end of last year, before the Biden administration was sworn in. While the deal is on ice amid objections from the European Parliament, many EU governments, including Berlin, have strongly supported it.The NATO summit on Monday once again made clear how much disagreement there is among allies on different sides of the Atlantic in confronting Beijing, and America's more hardline stance.Tai, however, argued that the goodwill from the aviation deal could spread more widely.""My confidence level is high with respect to this industry, this dispute, but also the larger issue of U.S.-EU collaboration and what democracies can accomplish when we work together in a spirit of pragmatism and effectiveness,” she said.Anita Kumar and Doug Palmer contributed reporting.POLITICOPOLITICO",positive,0.57,0.27,0.16,mixed,0.09,0.06,0.85,True,English,"['AFP', 'Getty Images', 'EU', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'European Commission', 'EU', 'EU', 'Airbus', 'EU', 'Airbus', 'Airbus', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'House Ways and Means Committee', 'EU', 'EU', 'WTO', 'European Parliament', 'EU']","['full US-EU peace deal', 'Airplane truce', 'senior U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady', 'former U.S. President Donald Trump', 'U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'U.S. President Joe Biden', 'large civil aircraft sectors', 'inflammatory, transatlantic trade dispute', 'Airbus “repayable launch investments', 'U.S. producers', 'bruising Trump years', 'frantic final hours', 'festering 17-year feud', 'bigger unresolved problem', 'level playing field', 'absolute legal certainty', 'long overdue commitment', 'secret defense contracts', 'clear underlying differences', 'Other transatlantic difficulties', 'new airplane models', 'transatlantic peace deal', 'U.K.', 'other sectors', 'trade committee', 'aircraft makers', 'Airbus-Boeing dispute', 'transatlantic feuds', 'transatlantic relationship', 'transatlantic partnership', 'airplane makers', 'airplane deal', 'other challenges', 'new model', 'Both Biden', 'public show', 'Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'Amazon Polly', 'bitter aftertaste', 'European Commission', 'key moment', 'national security', 'data transfers', 'green taxation', 'cruising speed', 'red line', 'United States', 'conclusive endgame', 'broad guidelines', 'less money', 'indirect aid', 'working group', 'non-market practices', 'definitive line', 'Republican leader', 'House Ways', 'Means Committee', 'five-year truce', 'Bernd Lange', 'European Parliament', 'six-month deadline.', 'multi-billion-dollar tariffs', 'Subsidy scrap', 'economic model', 'WTO-authorized tariffs', 'permanent end', 'aviation subsidies', 'many subsidies', 'past weeks', 'two sides', 'third parties', 'retaliatory duties', 'unfair subsidies', 'five-year ceasefire', 'EU support', 'EU tr', 'subsidy transparency', 'America', 'China', 'Press', 'Voiced', 'fledged', 'negotiations', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'Tuesday', 'something', 'trust', 'Washington', 'track', 'terms', 'sign', 'disputes', 'steel', 'aluminum', 'hurry', 'justification', 'grounds', 'topics', 'trouble', 'flexibility', 'reporters', 'industry', 'behavior', 'case', 'danger', 'swords', 'payments', 'types', 'discussion', 'France', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'credits', 'details', 'kind', 'minister', 'nod', 'alliance', 'framework', 'failure', 'confidence', 'today', 'risk', 'targets', 'wine', 'cheese', 'firm', 'reimposition', 'statement', 'fact', 'negotiators', 'time', 'chair', 'resolution']",2021-06-15,politico.eu,ICE Clear Europe

But the idea for the common insurance policy, first proposed in 2015, is highly controversial within Germany’s political circles.At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, deputy finance ministers agreed negotiations should be put on ice until after September’s federal election in Germany, in the hope of reaching an agreement with the next German government by December, four EU officials told POLITICO.Berlin refused to sanction a work plan laying out steps to create an EDIS without ensuring that banks reduce the amount of sovereign debt they have on their books — something Rome strongly opposes.The delay means finance ministers no longer face the prospect of all-night talks when they gather in Luxembourg for this month’s Eurogroup meeting, where EU officials had expected a showdown between Germany and Italy to agree on a final work plan for a key component of the bloc’s banking union plans.Without the insurance scheme in place, people’s deposits remain vulnerable in the next financial crisis — a threat that’s growing by the day as pandemic-hit businesses struggle to pay back their bank loans while lenders struggle to turn a profit. A tsunami of bankruptcies could push many European banks over the edge, leaving EU governments, many of which are heavily indebted due to the pandemic, with the nightmare task of handling a banking crisis.A spokesperson for Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe declined to comment on the outcome of Tuesday’s meeting, but said, “Although the Banking Union remains a challenging task and a sensitive policy area, the President of the Eurogroup is committed to finding consensus among all finance ministers and delivering an ambitious work plan as soon as possible.”Germany’s election makes the negotiations particularly difficult given a deep-seated fear within many Northern countries that banks in Southern Europe are in poor health, a concern born out of the sovereign debt crisis.Agreeing to EDIS would put the German banks and others on the hook for bailing out Southern savers. According to documents viewed by POLITICO, Berlin refused to introduce EDIS before the EU introduces fresh measures that will reduce the amount of public debt that banks buy from their sovereigns.The relationship is known as the doom-loop, as a government default would wipe out the country’s lenders, and has only deepened since the pandemic struck.However, some economists question the Northern European rationale. “Some governments may prefer not to do anything and to justify it by saying all banks in the south are so dangerous,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel in Brussels. “That point may have been true five years ago, but is not that compelling now,” after Southern countries made strides in recent years to clean up bank balance sheets and reduce financial risks in the industry.Rome is dead set against initiatives that would discourage its banks from buying up Italian state bonds, officials who took part in Tuesday’s meetings said. Doing so could push up the cost of borrowing, a dangerous scenario for Italy considering its public debt pile of over 155 percent of economic output.Both sides are being stubborn, officials said, pointing to other countries’ willingness to give ground on their red lines in the hopes of securing a work plan with clear objectives.After drafts suggested ministers could sign off on a watered-down work plan with few commitments to get something over the line, Donohoe and his team of negotiators opted to seek to revive talks in the fall, rather than fudge a deal.The Irishman must now explain his decision in a letter to EU leaders, who had been expecting results by the time of next week’s summit. Deputies agreed Tuesday that no “finger-pointing” should emerge from the stalemate, three officials said.",positive,0.49,0.38,0.13,mixed,0.03,0.07,0.9,True,English,"['European Deposit Insurance Scheme', 'German government', 'EU', 'POLITICO', 'EDIS', 'EU', 'EU', 'Eurogroup', 'Banking Union', 'Eurogroup', 'EDIS', 'POLITICO', 'EDIS', 'EU', 'Bruegel', 'EU']","['eurozone banking safeguards', 'Germany', 'nein', 'The European Deposit Insurance Scheme', 'national deposit guarantee funds', 'Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe', 'deposit insurance system', 'Northern European rationale', 'common insurance policy', 'central cash pot', 'sensitive policy area', 'Nicolas Véron', 'Italian state bonds', 'many Northern countries', 'bank balance sheets', 'other countries’ willingness', 'future banking crisis', 'final work plan', 'ambitious work plan', 'watered-down work plan', 'many European banks', 'public debt pile', 'next financial crisis', 'sovereign debt crisis', 'deputy finance ministers', 'next German government', 'banking union plans', 'four EU officials', 'next week', 'Eurozone countries', 'reform plans', 'timebound plan', 'bank loans', 'government default', 'Southern countries', 'public money', 'financial collapse', 'financial risks', 'closed doors', 'political circles', 'Eurogroup meeting', 'key component', 'pandemic-hit businesses', 'nightmare task', 'challenging task', 'seated fear', 'Southern Europe', 'poor health', 'fresh measures', 'senior fellow', 'recent years', 'dangerous scenario', 'economic output', 'red lines', 'clear objectives', 'EU leaders', 'German banks', 'three officials', 'closed-door meeting', 'deep resistance', 'federal election', 'night talks', 'EU governments', 'Southern savers', 'Tuesday', 'pause', 'Berlin', 'months', 'backup', 'idea', 'Germany', 'negotiations', 'ice', 'September', 'hope', 'agreement', 'December', 'POLITICO', 'steps', 'EDIS', 'amount', 'books', 'something', 'Rome', 'delay', 'prospect', 'Luxembourg', 'showdown', 'Italy', 'bloc', 'place', 'people', 'deposits', 'threat', 'lenders', 'profit', 'tsunami', 'bankruptcies', 'edge', 'spokesperson', 'outcome', 'consensus', 'concern', 'others', 'hook', 'documents', 'sovereigns', 'relationship', 'doom-loop', 'country', 'economists', 'Bruegel', 'Brussels', 'point', 'strides', 'industry', 'initiatives', 'part', 'meetings', 'cost', 'borrowing', '155 percent', 'sides', 'ground', 'drafts', 'commitments', 'team', 'negotiators', 'fall', 'deal', 'Irishman', 'decision', 'letter', 'results', 'summit', 'Deputies', 'stalemate']",2021-06-16,politico.eu,ICE Clear Europe

It is part of a broad effort to solve the mystery of why a world so much like ours turned out so differently.The European mission, called EnVision, will orbit Venus and probe the surface with radar, looking for signs of volcanic activity both past and present. Volcanoes are believed to be the source of a planet's atmosphere and the atmosphere of Venus is incredibly different from ours and that of Mars.If you have felt the intense heat when you open the door of an oven that has been baking at 200 C, that would be considered a cold day on Venus. The temperature on the surface is more than twice that, an unimaginable 464 C — higher than the melting point of lead.This image made available by NASA shows Venus with data from the Magellan spacecraft and Pioneer Venus Orbiter. On Wednesday, June 2, 2021, NASA’s new administrator, Bill Nelson, announced two new robotic missions to the solar system's hottest planet, during his first major address to employees. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/The Associated Press)Any spacecraft we send there has little chance of surviving for long. The only craft to land on Venus were the Russian Venera series . In fact, Venera 3 was the first spacecraft to touch another planet in 1966. However, it was a crash landing, as the spacecraft failed in the atmosphere.Several following missions were lost due to the harsh conditions, and even those that landed successfully didn't last for long. Venera 9 operated for a full 53 minutes, but in that time was able to successfully send back the first image of Venus's surface. The Venera 13 mission survived for just a bit over two hours. In 1978, the U.S. sent its Pioneer Venus missions, and while one of the atmospheric probes survived to reach the surface, it succumbed after 45 minutes.This panorama image, taken by the Venera 13 spacecraft on March 1, 1982, is one of the few images ever taken on the surface of Venus, Earth's nearest neighbour. The planet's thick clouds make its surface impossible for an orbiter to see. (NASA History Office)Given the conditions, it's highly unlikely a human will ever set foot on Venus.We have three planets in our solar system, Venus, Earth and Mars, all made of similar rocky materials, all within the habitable zone of the sun, but with three very different environments. One is a super-hot runaway greenhouse, enshrouded in a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. One is in a permanent ice age with frigid temperatures under an extremely thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, and the other, right in the middle, is just right with nitrogen and oxygen air to breathe and live in.The intriguing part of this mystery of why the planets are so different is the fact that at one time in the distant past, they were much more alike. There is evidence that billions of years ago Venus was cooler with liquid water on its surface and we're pretty sure that Mars was warmer and wetter as well. That means there could have been a time long, long ago when there were three blue planets.This radar map from the Magellan spacecraft's visit to Venus in 1990 shows a Venusian mountain and lava fields. Conditions on the planet are incredibly hostile today, but a billion years ago might have been quite pleasant. (NASA)The reason we explore other planets is to better understand our own. Venus and Mars changed from conditions that might have supported life to dramatically different environments and have remained that way ever since. The Earth on the other hand, is in a constant state of change, with ice ages and warm periods battling for dominance over geological time.It's clear that planets are capable of dramatic global transformations. In the past, those changes have been the result of volcanic activity, impact of objects from space or the movement of continents. Now we humans are affecting the climate on a global scale in a very short time, pushing a system that has the ability to transform profoundly. Nobody is suggesting that the Earth is in danger of turning into something like Venus or Mars. But they are a vivid illustration of what can happen to a planet when its climate goes awry.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.09,0.55,True,English,"['NASA', 'European Space Agency', 'NASA', 'NASA', 'NASA', 'JPL-', 'Caltech', 'The Associated Press', 'NASA', 'NASA']","['three new spacecraft', 'Europe', 'NASA', 'Venus', 'dense carbon dioxide atmosphere', 'thin carbon dioxide atmosphere', 'two new robotic missions', 'three very different environments', 'The European Space Agency', 'Several following missions', 'The Associated Press', 'similar rocky materials', 'super-hot runaway greenhouse', 'permanent ice age', 'dramatic global transformations', 'first major address', 'Russian Venera series', 'two American spacecraft', 'three blue planets', 'Pioneer Venus missions', 'NASA History Office', 'The Venera 13 mission', 'Pioneer Venus Orbiter', 'European mission', 'new administrator', 'two hours', 'three planets', 'ice ages', 'global scale', 'The Earth', 'first spacecraft', 'broad effort', 'volcanic activity', 'intense heat', 'melting point', 'Bill Nelson', 'little chance', 'crash landing', 'first image', 'U.S.', 'atmospheric probes', 'nearest neighbour', 'thick clouds', 'habitable zone', 'frigid temperatures', 'oxygen air', 'liquid water', 'Venusian mountain', 'lava fields', 'other hand', 'constant state', 'warm periods', 'vivid illustration', 'Magellan spacecraft', 'Venera 13 spacecraft', 'other planets', 'solar system', 'panorama image', 'one time', 'geological time', 'short time', 'full 53 minutes', 'intriguing part', 'distant past', 'radar map', 'sister planet', 'hottest planet', 'harsh conditions', '45 minutes', 'mystery', 'world', 'surface', 'signs', 'Volcanoes', 'source', 'Mars', 'door', 'oven', '200 C', '464 C', 'lead', 'data', 'Wednesday', 'June', 'employees', 'JPL-Caltech', 'fact', 'March', 'images', 'human', 'foot', 'sun', 'middle', 'nitrogen', 'evidence', 'billions', 'visit', 'reason', 'life', 'change', 'dominance', 'result', 'impact', 'objects', 'movement', 'continents', 'climate', 'ability', 'Nobody', 'danger', 'something']",2021-06-12,cbc.ca,ICE Clear Europe

For the White House, it also signaled a return of the United States to the type of consensus-based diplomacy shunned by former President Donald Trump.Like any high school homecoming, Biden found some familiar things: the stilted family photo, the quick diplomatic pull-asides, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But he also found some things have changed. Staunch American allies, shaken after the political upheaval of the Trump era, are increasingly working to define their own foreign policies separate from a country whose internal politics remain mired in dysfunction.Global earthquakes like Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic had not yet happened the last time Biden attended a diplomatic summit as an elected leader and were major topics of discussion in Cornwall.And the dramatic escalation of cybercrime and digital surveillance provided a menacing subtext, including on Saturday when organizers decided to cut off internet to the meeting room as the leaders engaged in sensitive talks on China.As Biden moves onward to Brussels for a NATO summit, here are three takeaways from the G7 summit:A weight liftedThe differences in body language between this weekend's summit in Cornwall and the three summits attended by Trump couldn't be starker. If the 45th President was sometimes pictured looking sullen as other leaders united against him, Biden seemed to take pains to look relaxed and comfortable among the world leaders, even when differences arose.He laughed heartily sitting alongside British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who seemed relieved Biden has apparently moved past his description of the Prime Minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Trump.Biden leaned into an embrace from French President Emmanuel Macron, with both men pressing into each other's sides as they walked arm-in-arm into the summit venue, forcing other leaders to walk around. As their meeting the next day started, Biden was clutching a pair of his aviator sunglasses when he passed off to Macron a question on whether America was back.""Yes, definitely,"" the French President said. He added later, ""It is great to have a US president who's part of the club and very willing to cooperate.""Biden and Merkel met outdoors, taking advantage of the coastal sunshine for talks punctuated by laughter. That evening Biden joined the leaders for some more forced bonding, this time in the form of a beach barbecue that featured ice cream sundaes for dessert.Biden's foreign policy pitch as a candidate centered in large part on Trump's apparently unwillingness to cultivate positive relationships with world leaders. As a senator and then as vice president, Biden's style of diplomacy was uniquely focused on the give-and-take between two human beings.In his first months in office, Biden tried conducting meetings with foreign leaders over video conference. But he told aides it wasn't the same and that he needed to start traveling as soon as it was safe.Over the course of the three-day summit, Biden met individually with at least four leaders, and sat for hours of talks with the entire group.Differences remainStill, for all of Biden's attempts to put forward a show of comity, there were limits on what the leaders could agree to in the end.One of Biden's major proposals to the group -- a global infrastructure program meant to compete with China's Belt and Road initiative -- was included in the summit's final statement. But it didn't include any specific commitments from countries on how much they're willing to contribute.A statement on ending the use of coal for electricity was vague and came without a timeline.And though language on China went further in calling out Beijing's human rights and economic abuses than previous G7 statements, earlier drafts of the communiqué were sharper. Behind the scenes, European leaders appeared resistant to go as far as Biden wanted in holding China to account.Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Biden said he was ""satisfied"" with the final document but seemed to acknowledge no outcome would ever be perfect.""I think there is plenty of action on China and there is always something that you can -- I'm sure my colleagues, they think they can improve,"" he said.Biden has framed his entire trip around the notion of defending democracy in a battle against authoritarianism. But some in Europe find the democracy versus autocracy formulation overly reductive, allowing little room for the reality that many countries will end up relying on China or Russia in some form or another.Biden, at his news conference, said he believed he had moved some of the leaders along toward his view.""Everyone at the table understood, and understands, both the seriousness and the challenges that we are up against and the responsibility of our proud democracies to step up and deliver for the rest of the world,"" he said.The best example of that this week was a joint pledge by the leaders to provide an additional 1 billion vaccines to poor or middle-income countries, including 500 million from the United States. Yet even some members of the G7 are still struggling to vaccinate their population.Speaking herself to reporters following the summit, Merkel was frank that just having Biden in the US seat at the G7 wasn't an end to the problems facing the world.But she said it did mean the group can work with new ""zest"" to solve them.On to the autocratsBiden's trip this week has been carefully choreographed to highlight traditional American alliances before next Wednesday's summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden has been spending much of his downtime on his trip preparing for that meeting, which will occur inside an 18th-century Swiss villa overlooking Lake Geneva.Nearly as soon as he arrived, Biden teased a contentious atmosphere for his trip's concluding meeting.""I'm headed to the G7, then to the NATO ministerial and then to meet with Mr. Putin to let him know what I want him to know,"" Biden told troops gathered at an airbase in Suffolk.How much support he got from fellow G7 leaders isn't exactly clear. In the final document, the leaders took Russia to task for malign cyber activity, including ransomware attacks, and for regional aggression.But even Merkel, one of Biden's closest allies at the G7, has found it difficult to swear off Russia forever. Biden recently waived sanctions on Germany related to the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have complicated relations with a reliable ally.Biden on Sunday said he agreed with Putin that US-Russia ties are at a low point. But he said it was worth meeting him anyway.Afterward, the two leaders won't hold a joint press conference -- something past presidents have done.""I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward with him about our concerns,"" Biden said on Sunday. ""And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out and he'll make clear how -- from his perspective how it turned out.""",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.29,0.12,0.59,True,English,"['CNN', 'White House', 'NATO']","['President Joe Biden', 'first G7 summit', '3 takeaways', 'British Prime Minister Boris Johnson', 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel', 'former President Donald Trump', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Staunch American allies', 'ice cream sundaes', 'quick diplomatic pull-asides', 'two human beings', 'global infrastructure program', 'previous G7 statements', 'foreign policy pitch', 'high school homecoming', 'President Joe Biden', 'Global earthquakes', '45th President', 'US president', 'vice president', 'human rights', 'foreign policies', 'diplomatic summit', 'G7 summit', 'Cornish coast', 'international summits', 'elder statesman', 'White House', 'United States', 'family photo', 'political upheaval', 'internal politics', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'major topics', 'dramatic escalation', 'digital surveillance', 'menacing subtext', 'three takeaways', 'weight lifted', 'three summits', 'emotional clone', 'aviator sunglasses', 'coastal sunshine', 'forced bonding', 'beach barbecue', 'positive relationships', 'first months', 'foreign leaders', 'video conference', 'major proposals', 'specific commitments', 'economic abuses', 'earlier drafts', 'news conference', 'final document', 'entire trip', 'autocracy formulation', 'little room', 'Trump era', 'NATO summit', 'summit venue', 'three-day summit', 'world leaders', 'other leaders', 'four leaders', 'European leaders', 'consensus-based diplomacy', 'familiar things', 'meeting room', 'body language', 'large part', 'entire group', 'final statement', 'many countries', 'sensitive talks', 'As Biden', 'Brussels', 'CNN', 'aides', 'visit', 'something', 'fixture', 'return', 'table', 'place', 'club', 'type', 'stilted', 'country', 'dysfunction', 'Brexit', 'discussion', 'Cornwall', 'cybercrime', 'Saturday', 'organizers', 'internet', 'China', 'differences', 'weekend', 'pains', 'description', 'physical', 'embrace', 'arm', 'pair', 'question', 'advantage', 'laughter', 'dessert', 'candidate', 'senator', 'style', 'give', 'office', 'meetings', 'course', 'hours', 'attempts', 'show', 'comity', 'limits', 'Belt', 'Road', 'initiative', 'coal', 'electricity', 'timeline', 'Beijing', 'communiqué', 'scenes', 'account', 'Sunday', 'outcome', 'plenty', 'action', 'colleagues', 'notion', 'democracy', 'battle', 'authoritarianism', 'reality', 'Russia', 'view', 'Everyone', 'seriousness']",2021-06-13,cnn.com,ICE Clear Europe

Seated in front of his rug store on the street that cuts through the heart of ancient Athens, Theo Iliadis takes in the scene. At 47, the owner of The Loom has seen “a lot of bad stuff” in recent years. The global pandemic couldn’t have come at a worse time for Greece, already gutted by prolonged economic crisis.But barely a month after the tourist-dependent country opened its doors, the entrepreneur is in ebullient mood. There’s a glint in his eye and a lightness in the air of the carpet-stacked cavern behind him. “Americans are in town,” he smiles. “Business is good, The Loom is good and I’ve got drinks on ice.”Iliadis has every reason to feel content. US tourists think nothing, he says, of spending “up to €15,000” on old tribal rugs, carpets and kilims at his family-run shop. “They appreciate hand-made work and they’re great spenders.”Confounding predictions, Greece is experiencing a recovery of its heaviest industry – tourism – thanks to an unexpected surge in visitors from the US. Few would have predicted it this time last year when lockdowns made Europe a distant dream, but in the shadow of the Acropolis last week it was Americans who were taking advantage of Athens’s determination to kick off the season.“I’ve been coming here for years but never has there been a direct flight from Chicago,” says Carin Silkaitis who heads the theatre department at Chicago’s Columbia College. “When I saw it online I said, ‘We’re going’,” she enthuses, enjoying a glass of Iliadis’s local firewater – a drink he gamely describes as “milk of the tiger” – after venturing into the store. “It was a huge plane and very full – everyone is feeling the itch to travel after being cooped up for so long.”To meet demand, more direct daily flights to Greece from the US have been inaugurated than at any other time. The Greek tourism minister, Haris Theoharis, says that 10 airlines, including nine US carriers, are adding Athens to their route schedules as vaccination rollouts drive a rebound in commercial air travel.Theoharis describes the American recovery as huge compared with other parts of Europe, calling it a reward for a tourism revival based as much on the nation’s relatively successful handling of Covid-19 as strategic planning. With a total of 414,000 coronavirus cases so far, infection rates have been lower than on most other parts of the continent.“We branded Greece as a safe destination and we said we would open on 14 May,” he told the Observer. “We didn’t change dates. It was unequivocal. The message was clear.”US-Greek relations have never been as good, diplomatically or militarily, which has further enhanced cooperation. Theoharis has spent much of the past six months on a plane himself as part of an aggressive bid to promote Greece by a pro-business government acutely aware of the sector’s phenomenal contribution to GDP. At over 20% of national outlay, tourism accounts for one in five jobs.The decision to launch so many non-stop flights to Athens followed trips to Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas, hub cities for airlines that now have the Greek capital on their route schedule. “More than 40% of all seats on these flights have already been sold. Recovery is somewhere around 50% [in the American market] on 2019,” he said, referring to the last pre-pandemic year when the Mediterranean hotspot attracted a record 33.1 million visitors. Of that number, more than three million were holidaymakers from the UK.In Greece to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary, Silkaitis and her wife, Chrissy, have an itinerary typical of many of their compatriots. After Athens they’ll head to Nafplion, the picturesque town in the Peloponnese, before visiting the ever-popular Cycladic islands of Naxos and Santorini. “We had thought of going to London, but Greece made it so much easier,” says the red-haired professor, an actor by profession.“In England, we had to quarantine and take tests. For Greece, we were told if you can prove you’re fully vaccinated and fill out the [country’s] passenger locator form, you’ll be free to enter. And it was exactly like the Greek consulate in Chicago said,” she laughs clicking her fingers. “After a nine-and-a half hour flight we were in Athens. Everyone was so helpful. There were multiple lanes at the airport, we showed them the forms and were rushed through.”The couple don’t hide that consulate officials also encouraged them to travel, saying: “Greece needs you, the economy needs you, spend, spend, spend.”Theoharis concedes that without arrivals from Britain, the nation’s main source market after Germany, Athens will still find it hard to salvage the season. “There is no way without the UK market it could even be a qualified success,” he sighs, adding that with Covid cases having “dropped dramatically” it was hoped the amber-listed destination would soon be put on London’s quarantine-free list.Still, it is “the American factor” that even smaller Greek hotels are depending on this year. Up in the hills outside Napflion, the proprietors of Perivoli, a country retreat nestled between olive trees and wild shrub, say they have had more bookings than at any other time from the US. Reservations have even come in for November from visitors keen to see Mycenae and other archaeological sites near the hotel. “Americans are heaven for us,” says Alekos Kastrinos, one of the co-owners, listing attributes that include friendliness, openness and a propensity to tip generously.“They are welcome [in] our country. They’ll leave their money and this will be very helpful for us after this disastrous coronavirus and the economic crisis. They’re a godsend.”",positive,0.56,0.44,0.0,mixed,0.55,0.11,0.34,True,English,"['The Loom', 'Loom', 'Columbia College', 'Iliadis', 'Observer', 'Greek consulate', 'Covid']","['US visitors', 'Americans', 'heaven', 'surge', 'Greece', 'lifeline', 'prolonged economic crisis', 'old tribal rugs', 'past six months', '10th wedding anniversary', 'popular Cycladic islands', 'passenger locator form', 'half hour flight', 'smaller Greek hotels', 'many non-stop flights', 'main source market', 'commercial air travel', 'last pre-pandemic year', 'record 33.1 million visitors', 'direct daily flights', 'most other parts', 'nine US carriers', 'Greek tourism minister', 'direct flight', 'Greek capital', 'Greek consulate', 'other time', 'American market', 'fresh wind', 'The Loom', 'bad stuff', 'global pandemic', 'worse time', 'ebullient mood', 'carpet-stacked cavern', 'family-run shop', 'hand-made work', 'great spenders', 'Confounding predictions', 'heaviest industry', 'unexpected surge', 'theatre department', 'Columbia College', 'local firewater', 'route schedules', 'vaccination rollouts', 'successful handling', 'strategic planning', '414,000 coronavirus cases', 'infection rates', 'safe destination', 'US-Greek relations', 'aggressive bid', 'pro-business government', 'phenomenal contribution', 'national outlay', 'five jobs', 'hub cities', 'Mediterranean hotspot', 'red-haired professor', 'multiple lanes', 'consulate officials', 'qualified success', 'Covid cases', 'listed destination', 'quarantine-free list', 'American factor', 'retreat nestle', 'UK market', 'US tourists', 'tourism revival', 'rug store', 'recent years', 'Carin Silkaitis', 'huge plane', 'picturesque town', 'Theo Iliadis', 'tourist-dependent country', 'American recovery', 'Haris Theoharis', 'ancient Athens', 'Adrianou', 'front', 'street', 'heart', 'scene', 'owner', 'lot', 'Greece', 'doors', 'entrepreneur', 'glint', 'eye', 'lightness', 'Americans', 'drinks', 'ice', 'reason', 'content', 'carpets', 'kilims', 'Few', 'lockdowns', 'Europe', 'shadow', 'Acropolis', 'advantage', 'determination', 'season', 'Chicago', 'glass', 'milk', 'tiger', 'everyone', 'itch', 'demand', '10 airlines', 'rebound', 'Covid-19', 'total', 'continent', '14 May', 'Observer', 'dates', 'message', 'cooperation', 'sector', 'GDP', 'decision', 'trips', 'Atlanta', 'Dallas', 'seats', 'number', 'holidaymakers', 'wife', 'Chrissy', 'itinerary', 'compatriots', 'Nafplion', 'Peloponnese', 'Naxos', 'Santorini', 'London', 'profession', 'England', 'tests', 'fingers', 'airport', 'forms', 'couple', 'economy', 'arrivals', 'Britain', 'Germany', 'way', 'hills', 'Napflion', 'proprietors', 'Perivoli']",2021-06-12,amp.theguardian.com,ICE Clear Europe

It’s definitely not a great feeling. You feel pretty helpless when your team’s out there battling and you’re watching from the stands,” he told reporters during Wednesday’s media availability after the Jets were swept by the Montreal Canadiens. “But the way you handle setbacks is what defines us. So, that’s the mentality I’m taking.”While last year it was an injury that forced Scheifele out of the Jets’ qualifying-round series against the Calgary Flames in Game 1, this year it was his own actions that took him out of play. Scheifele was issued a four-game suspension for charging Canadiens forward Jake Evans in the series-opener of Round 2. Evans had to be stretchered off and was diagnosed with a concussion.“I thought I was going to be tried to be shut down by Phillip Danault. Instead it was the Department of Player Safety that shut me down. So that definitely sucks,” Scheifele said of the suspension on Wednesday.Hockey Central To be clear, Mark Scheifele shut himself down June 09 2021 Your browser does not support the audio element.Share DownloadThis is the second time Scheifele has publicly addressed the suspension, having spoken to reporters following the league’s decision last week.“I think at the end of the day, you regret the outcome of it. I said that over and over. You never want to see a guy hurt, and I’m a guy that respects this game and respects players,” he said Wednesday, repeating his stance that he was trying to negate a goal when he hit Evans.“I would’ve loved an answer from [the department of player safety] of what would’ve been a better thing to do. I’ve replayed the thing over and over in my mind and the only real thing is if I gave up on my teammates on that play and just didn’t back check,” he said.Scheifele reiterated his stance that he still believes the suspension was “excessive.”“They knocked me out of the series,” he said. “I didn’t even get a chance to play with my teammates and battle with my teammates in the series … I’m gonna stop talking before I get fined or something like that.”Hellebuyck: We’re very close to being able to make runs and being a dynasty.”The Jets have been considered a contender the past few seasons now, and Hellebuyck has always made clear his will to win it all. He reiterated that on Wednesday when asked about the club’s mindset.“You want to win, and I think having the conversations I’ve had now, I think they do want to win and they want to win now,” Hellebuyck said of the Jets, adding that he believes every team should have that all-in will to win every single season. “They’re looking for the right pieces. My mindset is now, and next year I’m gonna say the same thing. You also don’t want to blow it for future years, so you want to be smart about it, but I think our organization definitely wants it now and they’re gonna do what they have to do.”He later added: “We’re close. We’re very close to being able to make runs and being a dynasty.”Wheeler talks expectations of 2018 vs. 2021 and beyondA lot can change in three years, and that includes the Jets’ identity. The 2018 edition of the Jets was one built more on a foundation of defence thanks to a group of veteran blue liners and an elite netminder, while this year it’s a strong, deep offence (and continued elite goaltending) that propelled the club into the playoffs. All along, the same core group of forwards has (mostly) remained, and captain Blake Wheeler believes it’s just now hitting its prime.“Our core was still very young. What you’d consider the core of our team, outside of myself probably, was very, very young,” Wheeler, 34, said of that 2018 roster. “And that core is now, I mean, they’re maturing into men in the primes of their career.”Among the core group of players under contract for at least the next three seasons are Wheeler, whose deal will expire following 2023-24; Mark Scheifele, 28; Kyle Connor, 24; Nikolaj Ehlers, 25; Adam Lowry, 28; Josh Morrissey, 26; and Hellebuyck, 28.The 2017-18 post-season brought Winnipeg’s best shot at winning to date, with the club advancing to the Western Conference Final where they lost in five games to the Vegas Golden Knights. One year later, the team finished second in the Central for the second consecutive time, with its Cup hopes cut short after losing in six games to the eventual champion St. Louis Blues.“Those two years, the back-to-back years, those were probably very real chances to win it all,” Wheeler reflected. “I think our team this year, we have a lot of the makings of what it takes to win it all. I’m excited about the direction that we’re headed, I think there’s a lot to look forward to for our group.”Wheeler continued: “The hardest part is formulating a core group of players that you believe are kind of the identity of your team and the guys that can push you over the hump — and I think we have that. That’s a great step in the right direction … that’s a group you can get really excited about.“Now, it’s just supplementing,” he said. “And in a flat-cap world, that’s gonna be Kevin [Cheveldayoff]’s challenge this summer, is ‘How do you fit the pieces in to kind of push that core over the top?’ And I guess that’s what remains to be seen.”Copp, Pionk, Stastny address upcoming contract negotiationsGeneral manager Kevin Cheveldayoff has a busy summer ahead, with a trio of crucial restricted free agents in defencemen Neal Pionk and Logan Stanley, and versatile forward Andrew Copp due new deals.On the UFA front, veteran forwards Paul Stastny, Mathieu Perrault, Nate Thompson and Trevor Lewis will all have decisions ahead of them. Asked about their impending contract talks, here’s what some of them said Wednesday:Andrew Copp, RFA: “Those conversations — where they see me moving forward here and the direction of the team, what we’re gonna do to make us better — are the two biggest things for me. I wouldn’t say anything’s off the table at this point, and I’m sure with everything kind of happening sooner rather than later that that will get addressed pretty quickly.”Copp went through the arbitration process two summers ago with the Jets, and said Wednesday that the experience of 2019 won’t impact this off-season’s negotiations.Paul Stastny, UFA: “I’m older, I think options are probably more limited.”Stastny, 35, said he was open to a return to the Jets but indicated he won’t be rushing into any decisions.“I think with the expansion draft and everything that’s going on, I’m pretty sure teams are gonna be busy trying to figure that stuff out.”He also made clear that what’s best for his family will factor heavily into any decisions made.“We’ll be patient about it. No rush. I kind of have an idea of what places you wanna play at but you wanna do what’s a good fit for you and you wanna go somewhere where you’re wanted, too,” he said. “I have nothing but good things to say here, and I know the future has always been bright, it continues to be bright. There’s always gonna be a chance here and I think that’s a really important piece to picking a team you wanna play at.”Players throw support behind Paul MauriceJets head coach Paul Maurice joined the team in January 2014 and is currently the second longest-tenured bench boss in the league behind Jon Cooper, who’s led Tampa Bay since March 2013.Said Wheeler: “I’ve been on teams where the coach has lost the team and the message isn’t received. But that has just never happened with Paul.”For Ehlers, Maurice is the only NHL head coach he’s ever known.“He’s been the coach since I came in. It’s very unusual, even in Europe, to have the same coach for that long. But it just shows what kind of coach and what kind of guy Paul is,” he said. “I think everyone on the team is very happy with the way he coaches us — and not just the on-ice stuff, but the off-ice stuff, too. He’s a guy you can go talk to when something’s up and there’s always something with the on-ice stuff that he’s got for you, whether it’s good or bad. And that goes for the whole coaching staff. They’re great at finding small things that they can help you with, whether they do video or it’s on ice, they pull you aside. I think that’s been huge for me, to work on small details of the game. That’s been great.”",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.39,0.07,0.54,True,English,"['Jets', 'NHL', 'Sportsnet.ca', 'Winnipeg Jets', 'Jets', 'Montreal Canadiens', 'Jets', 'Calgary Flames', 'Canadiens', 'Department of Player Safety', 'Hockey Central', 'of', 'Jets', 'Jets', 'Jets', 'Jets', 'Winnipeg', 'Vegas Golden Knights', 'St. Louis Blues']","['Jets’ Mark Scheifele', 'player safety', 'NHL', 'department', 'Sportsnet', 'ca', 'Winnipeg Jets‘ Stanley Cup hopes', 'veteran blue liners', 'strong, deep offence', 'Western Conference Final', 'Vegas Golden Knights', 'St. Louis Blues', 'second straight post-season', 'second consecutive time', 'captain Blake Wheeler', 'next three seasons', 'same core group', 'second time', '2017-18 post-season', 'three years', 'great feeling', 'media availability', 'Calgary Flames', 'Phillip Danault', 'Player Safety', 'audio element', 'Share Download', 'single season', 'right pieces', 'same thing', 'elite netminder', 'elite goaltending', 'Kyle Connor', 'Nikolaj Ehlers', 'Adam Lowry', 'Josh Morrissey', 'best shot', 'five games', 'six games', 'eventual champion', 'real chances', 'hardest part', 'great step', 'The Jets', 'future years', 'Montreal Canadiens', 'Hockey Central', 'real thing', 'Wheeler talks', 'right direction', 'Mark Scheifele', 'Jets’ identity', 'qualifying-round series', 'Jake Evans', 'four-game suspension', 'sidelines', 'team', 'stands', 'reporters', 'Wednesday', 'setbacks', 'mentality', 'injury', 'actions', 'series-opener', 'concussion', 'Department', 'browser', 'league', 'decision', 'outcome', 'guy', 'players', 'stance', 'answer', 'battle', 'something', 'Hellebuyck', 'runs', 'dynasty', 'past', 'will', 'club', 'mindset', 'conversations', 'organization', 'expectations', 'lot', '2018 edition', 'foundation', 'defence', 'playoffs', 'forwards', 'prime', '2018 roster', 'career', 'contract', 'deal', 'date', 'makings', 'hump']",2021-06-09,sportsnet.ca,ICE Clear Europe
ICE Clear Europe,0,PyNews API,https://amp.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/09/euro-2020-24-fans-24-countries-preview-tournament,Euro 2020: 24 fans from 24 countries preview the tournament,The main hurdle will be the group stage.I would be happy if we go past the group stage.Crashing out in the group stage would be a tragedy for us.We are going to need both to stand out in the group stage to give us a chance of reaching the final.Matt MScotlandI’ve seen a lot of fellow Scots talking about our prospects of going past the group stage.,"AustriaThe mood in Austria is carefully optimistic given our group. The Netherlands are far from playing their best football, and both North Macedonia and Ukraine are on a par with Austria. It all comes down to our opening game – a win against North Macedonia would significantly boost a team that have performed well over the last decade but lacked the killer instinct in crucial games.Unfortunately, Franco Foda has not been able to eliminate this problem since taking over from Marcel Koller as manager in January 2018. Keep an eye on Sasa Kalajdzic, a 6ft 7in striker who is like Peter Crouch with a better first touch. Advancing to the knockout stage would feel like a huge achievement for Austria but we won’t go any further than that. Bernhard OberngruberBelgiumWith a better manager in charge we probably would have won Euro 2016. Combine that with our bronze medal at the last World Cup and anything less than a semi-final at Euro 2020 would be a major disappointment. If Kevin De Bruyne, Axel Witsel and Eden Hazard are all fit, I fully expect us to reach the final.Romelu Lukaku has been in excellent form all season and Thibaut Courtois will have a couple of world-class saves in him to spare the blushes of our ageing defence. But I’m most excited about Jérémy Doku. The only teen in the squad, he has impressed in previous games and might become the revelation of the tournament.It’s time for this golden generation to finally bring home a trophy. I’ve been predicting we would win every major tournament since the World Cup in 2014. I haven’t been right so far, but fourth time lucky, right? So yeah, let’s start carving Belgium’s name on the trophy. Dieter RogiersCroatiaCroatia can reach the semi-finals. Some pundits seem to think that Luka Modric, the main driver of the team that reached the World Cup final three years ago, is diminished but he is still more than capable of keeping the midfield working and exploiting gaps in the opposition. Croatia are familiar with their opponents in the group, having played England and the Czech Republic in the last two major tournaments, and they can match them in most positions fairly well.I expect Ivan Perisic to be an important player for Croatia. He has finishing ability, a high workrate and a tenacity that gives him an edge in high-pressure situations – his equaliser and his assist to Mario Mandzukic in the World Cup semi-final against England being a prime example. I expect Croatia to reach the semi-finals but hope they avoid their bogey teams, France and Portugal. Tony MikulandraLuka Modric in action at the World Cup in 2018. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesCzech RepublicThe expectations are quite high. Of course, we don’t have the golden generation of the 2000s – when we had Pavel Nedved, Tomas Rosicky, Karel Poborský and Petr Cech – but we have some good players in the top European leagues, especially Tomas Soucek and Vladimir Coufal in England, Jakub Jankto at Sampdoria, and Patrik Schick at Bayer Leverkusen.The mood at home was quite confident until we played Italy in a warmup game and lost 4-0, showing just how big the difference is between the top nations and us. We know we don’t have the quality to beat England or Croatia, but beating Scotland and finishing third place in the group looks compulsory. I think we will reach the last 16. Jan PikousDenmarkFinishing second in a group that also contains Finland, Belgium and Russia seems very achievable and, due to the luck of the draw, we could reach the semi-finals without facing any of the giants. We have a path to go all the way, but we will have to squeeze wins out of close games.Kasper Schmeichel will be crucial. He knows how to win against long odds and, if Denmark are to topple a giant or two in this tournament, it will probably be due to him hitting his best form. If he doesn’t, we won’t survive one round in the knockout phase.We have done very well under the new coach, Kasper Hjulmand, who has the team playing fun, attacking football. While thrashing minnows doesn’t necessarily transform into matching giants, results like our 8-0 win against Moldova and 4-0 win against Austria show that this team is fun to watch. William JansenEnglandWe could go all the way. With home support, a blend of experienced champions and exciting young players, and a shrewd (if somewhat pragmatic) coach, the sky is the limit. That said, there are injury doubts over key players and I fear leaving James Ward-Prowse at home could be a mistake, especially if Jordan Henderson doesn’t get up to speed quickly. As well as being incredibly reliable and versatile, the Southampton midfielder is also a real danger from set pieces.There are so many potential highlights for this England team. It could be Harry Kane winning another golden boot, Phil Foden announcing himself on the world stage, or Jude Bellingham forcing his way into the team and keeping his place. After the Austria game, however, I feel like Jack Grealish has been waiting his whole life for the chance to show just how good he is on this type of stage. He has matured impressively over the past two seasons, adding another level of professionalism and determination to his game. If he makes a good start, he might just be undroppable.If we make a good start (and especially if we win against Scotland), it will push the optimism through the roof – à la Euro 96 – and we can look forward to a memorable tournament. My heart says we will win it, but my head says that, if we do make it through the semi-finals, we will end up losing the final. Alex IrvineCould this be Jack Grealish’s time to shine? Photograph: Laurence Griffiths - The FA/The FA/Getty ImagesFinlandWe will struggle against Denmark and Belgium in the group but, if they turn up expecting us to roll over, they might be in for a surprise. A draw – or perhaps even a win on a good day – might be on the cards against Russia. Lukas Hradecky is one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and he will have to be at his very best if Finland are to stand any chance in this tournament.As first-time qualifiers, there are no real expectations on the team. Just making the tournament is a dream come true for generations and generations of football fans in Finland. Johan PrestFranceFrance have one of the strongest squads at the competition. The main hurdle will be the group stage. We tend to start tournaments slowly – as shown against Australia at the last World Cup. Starting against Germany and then Portugal will be difficult, but France have the potential to top the group. The experience from 2018 will help them pull through.The Karim Benzema situation is also tricky, but he seems to be in really good spirits and the rest of the team seems to have welcomed him with open arms. He was also very good in the friendly against Wales.His performances will be central to the success of the team but France have many potential standout players. N’Golo Kanté holds everything together; I hope he carries his form from the Champions league into the tournament. The fans are still on a high from the World Cup; the team is very strong; and they can win it. Olivier SassevilleGermanyWe have a very tough group, facing France and Portugal. The team seem to be in a bad shape and I do not expect much from the Euros. I would be surprised if we make it out of the group.The team are strong in midfield, with İlkay Gündoğan, Toni Kroos, Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka, but there are many question marks on other positions. We do not have a world-class striker or full-backs and, even though the return of Mats Hummels and Thomas Müller has given people hope, I doubt that they will play a positive role in this tournament.Many fans are optimistic for the future after the Euros, when Hansi Flick will take over from Jogi Löw. But few people are optimistic about this last act of Löw’s 16 years in charge, a tenure that has become very painful since 2018. Andreas GleffThomas Müller is back in the Germany squad. Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty ImagesHungaryWe were underdogs at Euro 2016 and won our group. Now we are even bigger underdogs, and every Hungarian fan will be satisfied if we win a single point in the most brutal group of the Euros’ history. We have to face the European champions Portugal, the world champions France, and Germany. If we win any of these games, the whole country will be over the moon.Our only chance is the fully packed Puskás Aréna with 67,000 fans. We will be without a creative midfielder – both Dominik Szoboszlai and Zsolt Kalmár are injured – so don’t expect attractive, attacking football. But we have a well organised defence, with a good keeper, RB Leipzig’s Péter Gulácsi. All in all, Hungary will be a little boring, but full of fighting spirit. Aron HegyiItalyItaly’s excellent recent form, combined with a clear identity on the pitch courtesy of manager Roberto Mancini, puts them in contention for the title. Even though there seems to be no real standout star, it’s a well balanced squad full of interesting young talents and experience.As well as being strong at the back, as usual, Italy can count on decent attacking options in Ciro Immobile and Andrea Belotti, who will have Federico Chiesa and Lorenzo Insigne providing a constant threat behind them. In the middle, the Champions League winner Jorginho will be accompanied by the talented Manuel Locatelli and Niccolò Barella, who is creative, quick and clever.The mood among fans is one of cautious optimism, as always. The general consensus is that this squad could go far – but we’re not talking too much about it. Carlo AbbonaNorth MacedoniaQualifying for our first major tournament has brought much needed unity within our country and unbridled excitement among fans and players. Euro 2020 will be a great opportunity to present Macedonia in a positive light for once.Our team will surprise if we keep our main players fit for the three group games. The quality on the bench is lacking, so the starters must stay healthy. Playing three games in eight days is a concern. We do not have the ability to rotate without taking a significant hit, so the coaches and medical staff must be on top of their game.I am bullish that we can reach the last 16. Austria and Ukraine have terrible track records at past Euros (one win, two draws and nine defeats among them in their prior Euros appearances), while the Netherlands are weaker under Frank de Boer than they were under Ronald Koeman. There is no reason to fear any team in this group. The underdog role also suits our players. There is no pressure, so the players can be relaxed and play without nerves. They have nothing to lose. Beating Germany in late March gave them enormous confidence and belief. It showed that, when our key players are available, we can play with any side in Europe.The strength of this team lies in the unity, brotherhood and camaraderie among the players and coaches. They fight for one another and are willing to suffer for one another. The motto is one for all, all for one. This group has been together for years now and they are ready to take Europe by storm. Aleksandar ZlateskiNetherlandsExpectations are low, especially after the 2-2 draw against Scotland last week. I would be happy if we go past the group stage. We have some strong players. Memphis Depay is a real leader. He has so much talent and an amazing workrate. Then there is Frenkie de Jong, the player who is most able to break a team’s press and get the ball moving forward, as well as promising youngsters such as Ryan Gravenberch, Jurriën Timber and Cody Gakpo.Although, even though the players should be able to do quite well, recent games have been either terrible or just drab. Frank de Boer is intent on playing 5-3-2 but it doesn’t seem to be working at all. Eduard van DamMemphis Depay is the leader in the Netherlands squad. Photograph: Alexander Scheuber/UEfa/Getty ImagesPolandI expect us to advance from our group, after what should be a tight battle with Sweden for second place. If we can finish above Sweden, we may even have a chance of reaching the quarter-finals, as we would be playing the runners-up from England’s group. This would match our performance from Euro 2016 and would be a huge success.A lot rests on Robert Lewandowski. His goalscoring record over the past couple of years at Bayern has defied logic, as he appears to improve with age. Lewandowski has proven himself to be a complete striker and a true leader for Poland with his selfless performances at Euro 2016, as well as scoring the goals that propelled us to a third straight major tournament. How he deals with being incessantly targeted by opposition defenders will go a long way to deciding our fate in the tournament. Other players have to step up and perform around Lewandowski and the loss of Arek Milik to injury is a blow.My heart says we will reach the quarter-finals, but my head is settling for the last 16. Crashing out in the group stage would be a tragedy for us. Kuba WitkowskiPortugalI expect Portugal to be the contenders and would like us to play like we are contenders – although this is unlikely given the uber-pragmatic approach of our coach, Fernando Santos. This is probably our most talented squad ever, other than the golden generation of Luis Figo and Rui Costa.It is difficult to pick a standout player. Cristiano Ronaldo is Cristiano Ronaldo, but he is too slow. Bruno Fernandes is great, but I fear for his form. João Félix should have played more and may be lacking in confidence. So I’m going for the Manchester City duo of Bernardo Silva and Rúben Dias: the former epitomises our brains and the latter epitomises our muscles. We are going to need both to stand out in the group stage to give us a chance of reaching the final.In Portugal we are always optimistic deep down, but we are afraid to express it too much, for fear of karma falling on us. We know we have one of the best teams in the world, with talent in all areas of the field. At the same time, we have a coach that, despite being very successful with the team, seems afraid to play on the front foot. But, let’s face it: we are favourites to win the thing and we should accept that. Martinho Lucas PiresRussiaIt’s very difficult to judge Russia based on their recent matches. Their performances in the Nations League games, friendlies and World Cup qualifiers have not been inspiring but one wonders whether this is because Stanislav Cherchesov has been trying to find a different way of playing. Throughout the qualifying process, they were a 4-2-3-1 team that played very directly. Now they are often using a 3-4-2-1 formation, which helps explain the abundance of midfielders in the squad.Russia are strong from the midfield forward. Roman Zobnin is an excellent box-to-box centre midfielder who deserves more attention; the attacking midfielder Aleksandr Golovin is the star of the group; and, even though Denis Cheryshev has had injury problems at Valencia, he always plays better for Russia than his clubs. Aleksei Miranchuk is also a player on the rise. Despite not playing much for his new club Atalanta in Serie A, he is ready to break loose. And then, of course there is Artem Dzyuba at forward. He’s much more technical than people think. In general, Russia are starting to play a less direct and more sophisticated style of attack, which is promising. The greatest concern is the defence and goalkeeper.Russians are tired of Cherchesov. His reluctance to bring in young players is concerning – as are the team’s results since they secured qualification. Cherchesov has always been a reactive manager. What helped Russia in the World Cup was that he had more time to train his team and prepare them tactically. If Russia make it to the quarter-finals, it will be a success. Matt MScotlandI’ve seen a lot of fellow Scots talking about our prospects of going past the group stage. In all honesty I’m just happy to be there. I’m expecting us to put up a fight and score a couple of goals, but ultimately we’re in a group against two quality sides in Croatia and the Czech Republic, so we can’t be getting too carried away.If we can beat the Czechs then who knows, but I’m not going to fall into the trap of expecting too much. Being there and competing will do me just fine. Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney are our best players, but that wee spin John McGinn does on the half turn gets us up the pitch and on to the attack. He’s also got a goal in him.I’m really buzzing to be there. The fact there are games at Hampden is only hyping things up more. That moment when the national anthem is being belted out before the first game will be special. Chris BurnettScotland have a good defence but they need John McGinn to carry the ball up the pitch. Photograph: Gonzalo Arroyo - UEFA/UEFA/Getty ImagesSlovakiaWe are hoping to steal a point from Poland or Sweden but I expect Slovakia to finish last in the group. Even at 33, Marek Hamsik remains our most important player by far. If he isn’t playing well, there is no pathway to success for Slovakia.Though Slovak teams perform best when they are considered the underdogs, it is difficult to see this team going past the group stage. Sweden and Poland are tough opponents, and while many fans remember our glorious 2-1 win over Spain from the qualifiers for Euro 2016, repeating it at a tournament is unlikely. As long as we finish with more points than the UK’s Eurovision entry, the tournament should not be a disappointment.Slovakia’s sports fans are currently riding high after reaching the quarter-finals of the ice hockey world championships for the first time in eight years, which should lighten the expected disappointment from our football team’s performance at the Euros. Most people think we were quite lucky to qualify and, as the last of 2010 World Cup golden generation departs, it might be our last tournament for a while. Jakub BobroSpainI expect Spain to reach the quarter-finals. We do not have an outstanding player who has the ability to turn a draw into a win in the least expected moment. The team is solid but without many recognisable stars, especially given that Sergio Ramos has been left behind.The mood in Spain is, as always, focused on controversy: the players who are not in the squad, the personality of the coach and transfer gossip. If Spain do not win it – which I cannot see – I would like a team without previous silverware, like Belgium, to triumph. Diego FeduchiSwedenWe are good enough to get out of the group stage but not good enough to get over the final hurdles, so I expect us to reach the quarter-finals but to go no further. Alexander Isak is our standout player. He has performed well in La Liga for Real Sociedad and is the first real Swedish superstar in a while.Most Sweden fans are cheery but this year is different. Playing England, Holland, France, Belgium, Germany, Portugal or Spain could spell disaster for us but, considering our decent run at the World Cup in 2018, one would forgive a Swede for being optimistic. Daniel ArvidssonSwitzerlandA lot will depend on our ability to put the ball in the net. We are solid in defence and midfield and our goalkeeper Yann Sommer will be our best player – not for the first time. He is a superb keeper and still underrated.We will be hard to beat but our group is very tough. Italy are a dark horse for the tournament and, while Turkey and Wales are both beatable, there is not really a weak team in the group. We will have to hit the ground running against Wales and, if we pick up three points in that game, I would be fairly confident of progressing to the next round. And that is where our tournament will conclude in a realistic best-case scenario. Martin FlurySwitzerland always rely on Yann Sommer. Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesTurkeyI expect to see defensive solidity and a team drilled in discipline instead of the typical Turkish flair and unpredictability. Our best players are at the back and going forward has been a little bit of a problem lately. I expect us to qualify comfortably from one of the weaker groups in the competition. What happens thereafter is a mystery as draw, injuries, suspensions and potential Covid-related issues will all play a part in how far any team can go in the competition.Caglar Soyuncu is the skilled rock in what I’d dare call a star-studded backline, while Zeki Celik and Burak Yilmaz have had absolutely phenomenal campaigns for Lille in France. Fenerbahce’s Ozan Tufan, Milan’s Hakan Calhanoglu and West Brom’s Okay Yokuslu have usually been very reliable for the national side in the middle of the park, and this could be the breakout summer for the Trabzonspor goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir, who is likely to attract attention from some big clubs with his cat-like reflexes and ability to play with the ball at his feet.The fans have not been this optimistic for years. The dark years between 2009 and 2014, when the team were downright mediocre, and the “toxic” years between 2015 and 2018 when the national team players were mostly in newspapers for all the wrong reasons (Arda Turan, anyone?) contributed to an erosion of support for the national side. The situation has been reversed, though, with the rise of Soyuncu, Merih Demiral, Cakir, Celik, Umut Meras and Cengiz Under almost completely ridding the team of the old, and largely disappointing, guard. Fans are in love with the national side once more and, at the end of the day, that’s what matters. Ozgur CeltikciUkraineUkraine qualified top of their group, with impressive results over Portugal, and were unlucky to be relegated from the top tier of the Nations League, so they have promise. They stand a good chance of qualifying from their group and have a number of excellent talents, including Ruslan Malinovsky, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Roman Yaremchuk. Look out for Malinovsky. He has had a stellar season at Atalanta and can score with either foot. Has has produced some stunning strikes.We have a great coach in Andriy Shevchenko, who continues to develop the team. But expectations are not that high. Maybe there’s a freedom in that. Taras BulbaWalesWe face a much harder group than we did at Euro 16, so it will be a successful tournament if we can reach the knockout stage. A run to the semi-finals might be a dream too far this time.Everyone will be looking to Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey to come alive at the tournament and show their quality but one of the youngsters who has broken into the team over the last couple of years might surprise a few. My pick would be Neco Williams to shine.The majority of Wales fans are just happy that we are at the Euros and will enjoy the tournament (albeit mainly from home). It’s still only our second major tournament in recent times, so there is still that novelty factor. However, after the success of Euro 16, expectations will be a little higher. My heart says quarter-finals but, with a younger and less experienced squad, my head says we will do well to reach the last 16.

ICE Clear Europe,0,PyNews API,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/06/14/biden-putin-summit-nuclear-treaty-start-494313,Opinion | Biden and Putin Have a Nuclear Treaty to Discuss. Here’s What They Should Do.,"New START, which we finished negotiating in 2010, limits both sides’ nuclear missiles and bombers to 700 and caps their deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550.Mutual nuclear predictability is the hallmark of these treaties, a stable foundation to keep nuclear dangers at bay while we modernize our nuclear forces.But it didn’t directly limit nuclear warheads, in part because the issue was too sensitive given the top-secret nature of the weapons.Biden and Putin will also be talking about strategic stability, the idea that one country should not be able to gain decisive advantage over another with its strategic weapons.Biden and Putin have similarly signaled that they agree the strategic stability agenda should be separate from treaty negotiations.","New START, which we finished negotiating in 2010, limits both sides’ nuclear missiles and bombers to 700 and caps their deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550. This was a major reduction from the 12,000 warheads that each side deployed when the first START treaty entered into force in 1994. The current agreement has been extended until 2026, and Biden and Putin have made clear a new treaty must replace it after that date. Without a treaty, Russian nuclear forces would not be limited, and the Russians might be tempted to quickly build up their missiles and warheads. Of course, the Russians fear that we, too, might get away from them, especially as the United States is modernizing its own nuclear arsenal. Mutual nuclear predictability is the hallmark of these treaties, a stable foundation to keep nuclear dangers at bay while we modernize our nuclear forces.At their 2009 meeting, Obama and Medvedev set the standard for a short, simple statement that made clear exactly what negotiators’ next steps were. The statement had just three key points: The treaty would be about strategic offensive arms, it would reduce numbers below the levels in the last major U.S.-Russian arms control agreement, and it would be finished by the time that treaty went out of force. The clarity of those instructions and their high-level imprimatur were critical to our success negotiating the treaty.If Biden and Putin apply these principles in Geneva, their statement might look something like the following:First, the replacement for New START will focus on limiting strategic offensive arms, but will also acknowledge the relationship between strategic offensive forces and missile defense capabilities. Strategic offensive arms refer to nuclear weapons launched via bombers, submarines or land-based intercontinental missiles, while missile defenses are the missile interceptors and other technologies that would theoretically block a country’s nuclear weapons from hitting an adversary’s territory. The Russians have long worried that America’s defenses will become so capable that the United States might be emboldened to attack Russia because it's confident it can counter any retaliation. And this complex offense-defense dynamic goes both ways: The Russians, too, are developing ever-more capable missile defense systems such as the S-500, which could be used against intercontinental ballistic missiles.Second, the negotiations should include weapons delivery systems, including the exotic new missile systems Putin is rolling out, as well as the warheads themselves—that is, the actual bombs. New START limited delivery vehicles like missiles and bombers, as well as launch systems. But it didn’t directly limit nuclear warheads, in part because the issue was too sensitive given the top-secret nature of the weapons.Last year, President Donald Trump got Putin to agree in principle to a total freeze on warheads. This was a positive step toward a New START replacement. Figuring out how to constrain warheads and verify those constraints is a big deal for both sides.Third, the presidents should set a deadline, for example, the end of 2022. Deadlines are important for negotiators, since they tend to negotiate to fill the time available—and because of the famous Russian talent for slow-rolling. Nikita Khrushchev famously used to say that he could tell his foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, to sit on a block of ice for as long as it took the other side to capitulate. We were lucky we didn’t have this problem with New START, since Obama and Medvedev made clear we had to complete it by the time the previous treaty went out of force in December 2009. By setting a deadline, the presidents will leave no doubt that they mean business.Biden and Putin don’t need to dive into the details—which weapons to limit, or the technical aspects of how to verify that each side is complying. Indeed, Obama and Medvedev got to joking that we negotiators were loading them down with too many technical problems, such as how much missile telemetry, or flight test data, the two sides had to exchange. The leaders did not in fact make any technical breakthroughs on telemetry, but they did succeed in making clear to the Russian Ministry of Defense, which was resisting, that a telemetry exchange had to be part of New START.This shows how presidents lend enormous value, but only at the highest level of leadership. They spur momentum; they make their governments pay attention.Biden and Putin will also be talking about strategic stability, the idea that one country should not be able to gain decisive advantage over another with its strategic weapons. Here, too, Obama and Medvedev set a useful precedent, because they discussed strategic stability separately from the more concrete goals of the treaty. Biden and Putin have similarly signaled that they agree the strategic stability agenda should be separate from treaty negotiations. The goal here is a good discussion rather than a treaty, although over time the two sides may agree to some measures to build mutual understanding, confidence and predictability.",neutral,0.08,0.83,0.09,mixed,0.31,0.1,0.59,True,English,"['Russian nuclear forces', 'Russian Ministry of Defense']","['Nuclear Treaty', 'Opinion', 'Biden', 'Putin', 'last major U.S.-Russian arms control agreement', 'capable missile defense systems', 'exotic new missile systems', 'strategic offensive arms', 'three key points', 'complex offense-defense dynamic', 'limited delivery vehicles', 'President Donald Trump', 'flight test data', 'famous Russian talent', 'missile defense capabilities', 'many technical problems', 'weapons delivery systems', 'land-based intercontinental missiles', 'intercontinental ballistic missiles', 'strategic stability agenda', 'Mutual nuclear predictability', 'short, simple statement', 'Russian nuclear forces', 'major reduction', 'current agreement', 'first START treaty', 'New START replacement', 'launch systems', 'offensive forces', 'missile interceptors', 'Russian Ministry', 'missile telemetry', 'mutual understanding', 'missile defenses', 'technical aspects', 'technical breakthroughs', 'strategic weapons', 'nuclear missiles', 'nuclear arsenal', 'nuclear dangers', 'nuclear weapons', 'United States', 'stable foundation', 'next steps', 'high-level imprimatur', 'other technologies', 'actual bombs', 'top-secret nature', 'total freeze', 'positive step', 'big deal', 'Nikita Khrushchev', 'foreign minister', 'Andrei Gromyko', 'enormous value', 'highest level', 'decisive advantage', 'useful precedent', 'concrete goals', 'good discussion', 'new treaty', 'two sides', 'telemetry exchange', 'previous treaty', 'one country', 'nuclear warheads', 'other side', 'treaty negotiations', '12,000 warheads', 'bombers', 'Biden', 'Putin', 'date', 'Russians', 'course', 'hallmark', 'treaties', 'bay', '2009 meeting', 'Obama', 'Medvedev', 'standard', 'negotiators', 'numbers', 'levels', 'time', 'clarity', 'instructions', 'success', 'principles', 'Geneva', 'something', 'relationship', 'submarines', 'adversary', 'territory', 'America', 'retaliation', 'ways', 'S-500', 'part', 'issue', 'constraints', 'presidents', 'deadline', 'example', 'block', 'ice', 'December', 'doubt', 'business', 'details', 'leaders', 'fact', 'momentum', 'governments', 'attention', 'idea', 'measures', 'confidence']",2021-06-14,politico.com,ICE Clear Europe

Barkley, left, and President Harry Truman watch on [File: AP Photo] But NATO has struggled to redefine its role and relevance since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, despite expanding its domains to include outer space and cyberspace, and recently refocussing some of its attention on its old nemesis, Russia.It now also extends far beyond Europe, past Iraq and Afghanistan, to its new main concern, China.Noble beginningsIn the years following World War II, NATO evolved from a desire among European nations to protect themselves from any further aggression that might, once again, engulf the continent.Europe lay in ruins, its economies shattered, its resources and manpower depleted. Two superpowers had emerged from the war, the United States and the USSR. Joseph Stalin, ruler of the Soviet Union, had quickly assimilated most of Eastern Europe. Collective security for Western Europe, under the aegis of the United States, seemed the perfect solution. The North Atlantic Treaty Alliance was thus born in 1949 out of fear of Soviet intimidation and its potential for westward expansion. America had lost nearly 400,000 lives in the war but its economy and industries were thriving, giving it the fiscal clout not only to keep its own large standing of armed forces but to help those of Western Europe.While the emergence of NATO certainly helped ease European nations of their fears of another major conflict, the continent would nevertheless become the arena for the opening stages of what could become a nuclear war in a matter of hours, if not days.Increasingly concerned by the growth of NATO, the Communist Eastern Bloc in turn looked to form its own system of collective security. In 1955, the Warsaw Pact was formed by the Soviet Union and seven Eastern European countries, spurred on partly by West Germany joining NATO earlier that year.Soviet leaders draft a treaty to establish a unified military command to rival NATO in the parliament building in Warsaw, Poland on May 14, 1955. From left to right: Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev, supreme commander of the alliance; Vyacheslav M. Molotov, Soviet foreign minister; Premier Nikolai Bulganin; and defence minister Georgi Zhukov [File: AP Photo] Both sides had integrated nuclear weapons into all levels of their tactical and strategic thinking. To illustrate how extensive the use of nuclear weapons was, the Czech army for example, although only a minor Warsaw Pact country, had plans to launch more than 80 nuclear weapons at ports, marshalling yards and troop concentrations in the event of a major conflict.By the mid-1960s, similar plans were held by most of the major NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. With the real danger of Europe being reduced to radioactive rubble, a brutal impasse emerged, with the tacit understanding that any overt military act against another military would end in catastrophe for everyone concerned. It is in this risk-averse environment that NATO operated, with success throughout the Cold War period.Russian fear of encirclementYet despite the collapse of Communism, the crumbling of the Soviet Union and the subsequent dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, NATO kept going. Instead of being dissolved – as there was no longer any Soviet Union to contain – NATO expanded, going from 16 to 30 member states following the Soviet collapse.Former rivals from the Warsaw Pact, in fact most of Eastern Europe, were absorbed into a Western alliance whose mandate was to protect itself from Russia and limit its expansion. From a Russian point of view, this felt like containment all over again. The Alliance was repeatedly warned that Russia would not tolerate any of the states bordering its territory becoming members.To understand how alarmed Russia is by NATO’s expansion east, imagine how the United States would feel if Canada and/or Mexico had become members of the Warsaw Pact. An intolerable notion for the US, with much justification.This Russian fear of encirclement is one of the many reasons the conflict in Eastern Ukraine continues to smoulder. Ukraine has repeatedly asked to join NATO but it is in NATO’s charter not to accept any new member state that is involved in an existing conflict. Tacit Russian military involvement and the subsequent fighting in Donetsk effectively bars Ukraine from membership of the Alliance.Delegations from seven European Communist countries at the summit meeting of the Warsaw Pact, on March 17, 1969, in Budapest, Hungary [File: AP Photo] Furthermore, hard lessons were learned by Russia in the brushfire conflicts of Chechnya in the 1990s and Georgia in 2008. Despite eventual Russian victories, the conflicts exposed crucial deficiencies in tactics and training. It was clear that Russia’s armed forces were poorly equipped and did not have the training to leverage military technology to their advantage, as Western military forces had.Russia sought to benefit from its past mistakes and adapt effectively to modern warfare, leading it to embark on a crash modernisation programme, increasing investment and focusing on a smaller, more professional army that is far better trained and equipped.The real reason for joining NATO – members with benefits?The clash of ideas between NATO and the Warsaw Pact has always been painted as democracy versus authoritarianism, as well as the notion that the NATO of today is a confluence of like-minded democratic ideals and of shared values.A great idea, but it flies in the face of reality. Blind eyes were turned when the Greek and Turkish militaries overthrew their respective civilian governments during the Cold War in the 1960s. More recently, very little action has been taken by NATO member states over the Hungarian and Polish governments’ increasing lack of tolerance for political dissent, as they slide dangerously towards autocracy.For the most part, the premise that NATO upholds an ideal of democracy may be true, however, the exceptions are ignored, especially if the countries concerned are in strategic locations, such as Poland, which borders Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave, and Belarus, a Russian strategic ally.While the NATO alliance affords a good measure of protection by deterring any thought of military action against a member state, that is not the only reason to join. Other reasons are the tangible military benefits that member states will receive and the political, military and logistical leverage provided by the US that is so useful and so sought after – namely the soft side of American hard power.The United States has wielded this vast power for decades, not just in obvious military capabilities but in the areas in which most European nations are lacking: Intelligence gathering; logistical supply chains; strategic transport aircraft; helicopters and a vast body of military expertise and know-how that would simply cost too much for most nations to reproduce. In return, the US gets the right to establish military bases in these countries and is able to influence each country’s strategic thinking to a certain degree, comfortable with the notion that most countries would choose to follow a path laid out by the United States rather than opt out of the Alliance altogether.Citizens of West Berlin hold a vigil on the Berlin Wall on November 10, 1989 [File: Stringer/Reuters] Although critics of NATO focus on the pre-eminence of the US, imagine how NATO would fare without the help of the United States. Just over a decade ago, on June 10, 2011, the then US defence secretary Robert Gates stood in front of his NATO colleagues and assembled European dignitaries in what was his last major policy speech. In it, he berated the Alliance and castigated the Europeans for their lack of foresight, ineptitude and reliance on America’s endless help. The war in Afghanistan had exposed NATO’s shortcomings in being able to maintain 25,000 to 40,000 troops there, despite collectively having more than 2 million non-US personnel at its disposal.Gates was especially blunt when it came to the recently unfolding conflict in Libya. It is worth quoting some of the extracts from his speech, entitled Reflections on the Status and Future of the Transatlantic Alliance:“…while every alliance member voted for [the] Libya mission, less than half have participated at all, and fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission. Frankly, many of those allies sitting on the sidelines do so not because they do not want to participate, but simply because they can’t. The military capabilities simply aren’t there … Furthermore, the mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country – yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions, requiring the US, once more, to make up the difference.”He went on to draw a sharp line under the point made that Europeans need to do more – a lot more – if they want the United States to continue to support the NATO Alliance:“Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defence capabilities are not halted and reversed, future US political leaders – those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me – may not consider the return on America’s investment in NATO worth the cost.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, right, and and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg arrive for a news conference during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels, on March 23, 2021 [File: Yves Herman, Pool via AP] Yet, despite Gates’s frankness, very little was actually done by Europeans who were also going through their own fiscal convulsions as the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 made itself increasingly felt in all walks of life.It took the mercurial Trump administration to finally push member states to pledge they would increase their own defence spending, relieving some of the burden on the United States, whose focus was increasingly on a newly invigorated China, its military expansion now causing great alarm for both the West and the US’s Asia-Pacific allies.Pivot eastNATO has justified its new focus on China as a “collective defence” against what it views as Chinese encroachment on European interests.Key ports, such as the Port of Piraeus in Greece, one of the largest in Europe, are now majority-owned by Chinese companies, as they have sought to buy up commercially strategic properties for sale that could benefit China.Added to this are increased Chinese naval patrols in the Atlantic and China’s rising interest in the Arctic as well as the economic viability of the Northeast Passage over the top of Russia. This new route, just recently made possible by the thawing of Arctic ice sheets, has the potential to save thousands of kilometres on every commercial voyage to and from northern Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea and China.This increased activity in Europe, coupled with extensive cyberattacks on Western commercial and military targets that the Alliance says bear the hallmarks of the Chinese state, have many NATO nations worried.China is not doing anything wrong by investing in its own economic needs and logistics. It has bought sites that were already up for sale. It is operating in its own interests, as all countries do. But crackdowns on political dissent at home, together with an increasingly capable military have made many European states nervous about what comes next, if China’s interests are eventually crossed.A nuclear-powered Type 094A Jin-class ballistic missile submarine of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is seen during a military display in the South China Sea on April 12, 2018 [File: China Stringer Network/Reuters] This fear is amplified by the authoritarian state’s military-civilian fusion in many areas. In the South China Sea, there are large fleets of ships – allegedly Chinese fishermen attempting to make a living but which are, in fact, directly under the control of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). These fleets are often used to intimidate neighbours and stake de facto claims of Chinese ownership over the resource-rich waters of this strategically vital waterway. The latest incident was in March 2021 when more than 200 Chinese fishing vessels turned up in Whitsun Reef, an area of the South China Sea that both China and the Philippines claim.How will NATO deal with all of this? How will it project power in any meaningful way that will resolve any potential Chinese transgressions? This is the challenge NATO now sees for itself as it enters this new and uncertain phase, during which there are many who think the Alliance has either outlived its usefulness or needs refocusing and that better institutions and alliances already exist to help US interests in the Indo-Pacific region.As part of the United States’ pivot east to confront a rising China, it has increasingly invested in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, better known as the Quad. Established in 2007, it is made up of the US and regional allies – Japan, India and Australia. Initially a paper organisation, over the past few years it has become an alliance of growing cohesion and potency, as the navies of all four countries train extensively and seek to become more integrated.Aircraft carriers and warships participate in the second phase of a joint naval exercise between India, the US, Japan and Australia on November 17, 2020. The four countries form the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad [File: Indian Navy via AP] The basic fact is, if the US wants to contain China, it is going to need to co-opt Asia-Pacific powers into helping it do just that, in much the way the Soviet Union was contained. The difference being the Soviet Union had nowhere near the economic might China – fast on track to becoming the world’s biggest economy – has today.Desperately seeking relevanceNATO has been struggling with its ever-evolving identity since the end of the Cold War. Born from a desire for collective defence and containment of the USSR, its mandate morphed to include nation-building, peace-keeping, military-civil relations and the never-ending fight against terrorism and organised crime, with varying degrees of success.The original brief – that of European collective security – has been re-invigorated by Russia’s military modernisation. In 2014, the bloodless assimilation of Crimea into Russia, despite it being overwhelmingly ethnically Russian, sent shockwaves through NATO, especially among those who are Russia’s neighbours and who feel increasingly nervous that this “assimilation” might one day soon be used on them.This has given the Alliance some of its traditional focus back as collective security within Europe shifts east from Germany and the old East-West partitions to the new fault lines dividing the increasingly worried Baltic States and Poland from a resurgent Russia.Throughout its history, NATO has always been a fractious Alliance. The attempts to consider the national wants and needs of all its member states at times seem an impossible task. Sometimes the desire by a member state for military independence and the leeway to act in its own interests wins the day.Key ally and nuclear state France left in 1966, only to return, under certain conditions, decades later in 2009.Turkey, a vital member of the Alliance, has recently involved itself in conflicts on its doorstep in Syria and as far away as Libya. In these messy civil wars, often fought by proxies, NATO members have at times found themselves on opposing sides – the complicated network of temporary alliances shifting with remarkable speed.It is in this climate that NATO now has to operate – not faced, as during the Cold War, with one clearly defined adversary, but fighting a patchwork of local conflicts while maintaining an ever-growing alliance between countries all with their own strategic considerations. It is little wonder that NATO is still struggling to define itself.",negative,0.11,0.11,0.78,mixed,0.12,0.09,0.79,True,English,"['NATO', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'North Atlantic Treaty Organisation', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'North Atlantic Treaty Alliance', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'Communist Eastern Bloc', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'Czech army', 'NATO', 'Warsaw Pact', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'NATO', 'Alliance', 'NATO', 'Warsaw Pact', 'NATO', 'NATO']","['21st century', 'relevance', 'NATO', 'Vice President Alben W.

(Image credit: Shutterstock)National Geographic began making maps in 1915, but the society had only formally recognized just four oceans, which they defined by the continents that bordered them.In contrast, the Southern Ocean is defined not by the continents that surround it, but by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) that flows from west to east. Scientists think the ACC was created 34 million years ago when the continent of Antarctica separated from South America, allowing water to flow unimpeded around the ""bottom"" of the world.Today, the ACC flows through all waters that surround Antarctica until about 60 degrees south, except for the Drake Passage and the Scotia Sea, which are both roughly between South America's Cape Horn and the Antarctic Peninsula.The waters of the ACC — and therefore most of the Southern Ocean — are colder and slightly less salty than the ocean waters to the north.The ACC pulls in water from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans to help drive a global ""conveyor belt"" that carries heat around the planet, while the cold dense water of the ACC sinks and helps to store carbon in the deep ocean. And thousands of marine species live only within the ACC, according to National Geographic.Antarctic watersExactly what constitutes an ocean is not agreed, other than that they are the largest bodies of water. A common definition split the global ocean into four or five parts, according to the continents that surrounded them.Nevertheless, the term ""Southern Ocean"" had been used to describe the waters at the bottom of the world since they were first seen by the Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa early in the 16th century, and its use continued as oceans became vital routes for international communications and trade in the centuries that followed.By the 19th century, many maritime nations had established ""hydrographic"" authorities to publish information on the oceans for their navies and merchant vessels, and the term ""Southern Ocean"" appeared in the early publications of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) that they formed in 1921.But according to the book "" Southern Ocean: Oceanographers Perspective "" (Ice Press, 2015), the IHO rescinded the designation in 1953: ""The majority of opinions received … are to the effect that there exists no real justification for applying the term Ocean to this body of water,"" the IHO wrote in the guidelines it published that year.Scientists didn't agree, however, and the term has been increasingly used, as the importance and uniqueness of the Southern Ocean became more clear. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names started using it in 1999, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) officially began using it this year.The original ""ocean"" on Earth was, in fact, a river — named by the ancient Greeks after the titan Oceanus, a river god who was the son of Uranus and Gaia and the brother and husband of Tethys, the goddess of the primal waters that nourished the Earth. .This river ""Ocean"" was originally thought to encircle the world, which the early Greeks imagined ended somewhere just west of Europe and east of Asia. Eventually, the term would become used to describe the different parts of the global ocean.The related term ""Seven Seas,"" meanwhile, is much older than many modern oceans. No one knows where the concept originated, but the term appears in the ancient writings of the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Hindus, Persians and Chinese, although it often described entirely different seas — some of them mythical — for different people.According to the World Atlas website , the Seven Seas today are considered the seven largest oceanic bodies of water: the Arctic, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Southern or Antarctic OceanOriginally published on Live Science.",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.23,0.27,0.5,True,English,"['National Geographic Society', 'National Geographic', 'Shutterstock', 'National Geographic', 'ACC', 'ACC', 'ACC', 'National Geographic', 'International Hydrographic Organization', 'IHO', 'Ice Press', 'IHO', 'IHO', 'U.S. Board on Geographic Names', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'NOAA', 'World Atlas']","['fifth ocean', 'Earth', 'Vasco Núñez de Balboa', 'official geographer Alex Tait', 'The U.S. Board', 'The Antarctic Circumpolar Current', 'seven largest oceanic bodies', 'many maritime nations', 'global ""conveyor belt', 'many modern oceans', 'National Geographic website', 'World Atlas website', 'International Hydrographic Organization', 'cold dense water', 'icy southern continent', 'The Southern Ocean', 'World Oceans Day', 'National Geographic Society', 'largest bodies', 'Antarctic current', 'National Oceanic', 'Seven Seas', 'Antarctic Peninsula', 'international communications', 'geographic nerdiness', 'Geographic Names', 'The Earth', 'The ACC', 'global ocean', 'Antarctic waters', 'popular recognition', 'popular backing', 'biggest impacts', 'Image credit', 'South America', 'Drake Passage', 'Scotia Sea', 'Cape Horn', 'marine species', 'common definition', 'five parts', 'Spanish explorer', '16th century', '19th century', 'merchant vessels', 'early publications', 'Ice Press', 'real justification', 'Atmospheric Administration', 'titan Oceanus', 'different parts', 'ancient writings', 'different seas', 'different people', 'fifth ocean', 'separate ocean', 'deep ocean', 'original ""ocean', 'ancient Greeks', 'early Greeks', 'ocean world', 'frigid waters', 'primal waters', 'ocean waters', 'Arctic oceans', 'four oceans', 'Indian oceans', 'ice-covered bottom', 'river god', 'ACC sinks', 'related term', 'North Atlantic', 'decision', 'Antarctica', 'Pacific', 'designation', '100 years', 'scientists', 'June', 'maps', 'planet', 'photos', 'agreement', 'ways', 'education', 'Students', 'information', 'specifics', 'west', 'east', 'boundaries', 'Shutterstock', 'continents', 'contrast', 'heat', 'carbon', 'thousands', 'use', 'routes', 'trade', 'centuries', 'authorities', 'navies', 'IHO', 'book', 'Oceanographers', 'Perspective', 'majority', 'opinions', 'effect', 'body', 'guidelines', 'importance', 'uniqueness', 'NOAA', 'fact', 'son', 'Uranus', 'Gaia', 'brother', 'husband', 'Tethys', 'goddess', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'one', 'concept', 'Romans', 'Arabs', 'Hindus', 'Persians', 'Chinese', '60']",2021-06-14,livescience.com,ICE Clear Europe

Spot differentials have picked up on the heels of improving demand, consequently, changes in Middle Eastern OSPs for July 2021 were to be expected.Surprising the market with the extent of its price increases, Saudi Aramco raised its light and medium grades by 10-50 cents per barrel. Arab Super Light saw the highest month-on-month increase, moving to a $2.85 per barrel premium over the Oman/Dubai average, the highest this year. Arab Extra Light, a slightly more sulfurous quality peer to Murban, was raised by 40 cents per barrel, to a $1.90 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai. The surprise element in Aramco’s July hike boils down to the relatively marginal changes in the Dubai cash-futures spread, considered to be a key parameter of price setting, rising only 10 cents per barrel month-on-month. The only outlier grade, the Asian OSPs of which were in fact decreased month-on-month from June, is Arab Heavy, having receded 10 cents per barrel from the $0.50 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai last month. The primary reason for Arab Heavy losing traction lies in Asian fuel oil cracks remaining weak across Asia.SaudiGraph 1. Saudi Aramco OSPs for Northwest Europe (vs ICE Bwave).One of the main factors underlying the aggressive pricing policy of Saudi Aramco is the wide Brent-Dubai exchange of futures for swaps, abbreviated EFS, a market indicator that assesses the spread between light sweet crudes (such as Brent) and medium-heavy sour ones has continued to hover around the $3 per barrel mark and thus barring any sizeable amount of arbitrage barrels coming in from Europe or West Africa. Thus, East Asian refiners are finding long-haul voyages of light sweet grades, arguably the only sort that currently generates solid profits on the heels of convalescing gasoline cracks, rather uneconomical, allowing Saudi Aramco to hike differentials even on grades that tilt towards the heavier side.Story continuesOSPGraph 2. Iraqi OSPs for Asia in 2018-2021 (vs Oman/Dubai average).The Iraqi state oil marketer SOMO followed in the footsteps of Aramco and hiked its Asia-bound July OSPs for medium-heavy grades by 15-20 cents per barrel, simultaneously cutting Basrah Heavy prices by 10 cents per barrel to a -1.40 per barrel discount to the Oman/Dubai average. European official prices witnessed month-on-month hikes of 15-40 cents per barrel, with the Kirkuk July OSP rolled over from June. One of the most peculiar trends with regards to Iraqi pricing is the revival of sizeable US exports – this month will mark the highest monthly Iraqi arrivals since May 2020, at 220kbpd. Most of these barrels loaded in May; at that point, Iraqi grades, especially Basrah Heavy, emerged as an unexpectedly solid variant on the back of three consecutive months of US-bound price decreases.Related: How An Oil Pipeline Hack Sent Bitcoin Prices TumblingThere were no Basrah loadings so far in June that would indicate the US as their final destination, most probably reflecting on the OSP hikes last month. July, however, could once again see a rebound in Iraqi exports to the United States as SOMO’s latest OSPs see across-the-board month-on-month cuts by 10-15 cents per barrel. Another noteworthy trend taking place in Iraq has been Baghdad’s gradual refinery modernization drive, with the 140kbpd Daura refinery launching a new continuous catalytic reforming unit that will boost gasoline production within the domestic downstream sector. Perhaps even more importantly, the 210kbpd Basrah refinery has started the construction of its own fluid catalytic cracker and a diesel desulphurization unit of similar scope, meaning that by 2024 (when the refinery upgrade is supposed to be ready) Basrah might see a different split of export grades by volume. Moreover, Iraq would phase out most of its tender-based gasoline imports by 2024-2025 which cost the government more than $2 billion per year.OSPGraph 3. Iraqi OSPs for Europe 2018-2021 (vs Dated Brent).With five rounds of Vienna nuclear talks completed and presumably several more ahead, many refiners who were buying Iranian barrels in the pre-sanctions era started to prepare for their gradual return. Some Indian companies already indicated their readiness to buy Iranian, highlighting that before 2018 credit and freight terms offered by NIOC (i.e. deferred payment deadlines and the privilege of NIOC’s own tanker fleet) often proved to be more commercially advantageous than other Middle Eastern variants. Cognizant of the above, the Iranian national oil company set its July 2021 official selling prices with a clear intent of wooing buyers – it hiked the Asia-bound price of Iranian Light by 10 cents per barrel (to a $1.6 per barrel premium over Oman/Dubai) and rolled over Iranian Heavy from June. With this, the Arab Light-Iranian Light spread rose to its highest since March 2020, at -$0.30 per barrel.OSPGraph 4. Iranian OSPs for Asia (vs Oman/Dubai average).Even in the Mediterranean, the second-largest outlet pool for Iranian crude before 2018, NIOC chose to keep a solid 10/20 cents per barrel in contrast to Aramco pricing. It hiked the Iranian Light OSP by 80 cents per barrel to a -$2.95 per barrel discount to ICE Brent, i.e. 20 cents less than its direct Saudi peer Arab Light, whilst Iranian Heavy was increased by 50 cents to a -$4.7 per barrel discount to ICE, i.e. 10 cents less than Arab Medium. The likelihood that Iranian barrels would start flowing to Europe still remain extremely slim, nevertheless, Iran’s pricing decisions reflect its willingness to be flexible and go the extra mile to lure customers once it is allowed to export crude unimpeded.OilGraph 5. ADNOC OSPs in 2017-2021 (Dubai/IFAD).Following a rather volatile first month of trading in April, IFAD’s performance last month turned out to be much more robust and stable, proving that relying on market forces to set the forthcoming OSPs does indeed work in the Middle East (if needed). The formation period of the Dubai futures benchmark is still far from over - over the course of May, Morgan Stanley has joined the ranks of Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas to become an official clearing member of the IFAD exchange. Murban’s July 2021 OSP settled at $66.70 per barrel, equivalent to a $1.67 per barrel premium to front-month Dubai assessments. As for Das and Umm Lulu differentials to Murban, ADNOC has rolled them over from June, opting to alter only the heavier Upper Zakum, by 10 cents per barrel m-o-m to a 50 cent discount to Murban.By Gerald Jansen for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Read this article on OilPrice.com",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.08,0.78,True,English,"['Brent', 'Saudi Aramco', 'Arab Super Light', 'Extra', 'Murban', 'Aramco', 'Saudi Aramco', 'ICE Bwave', 'Saudi Aramco', 'Brent-Dubai', 'Saudi Aramco', 'OSP', 'SOMO', 'Aramco', 'OSP', 'SOMO', 'Daura', 'OSP', 'NIOC', 'NIOC']","['Middle East Oil Prices', 'Global Demand Recovers', 'new continuous catalytic reforming unit', 'highest monthly Iraqi arrivals', 'Arab Heavy losing traction', '2-3 month’ time lag', 'gradual refinery modernization drive', 'Iraqi state oil marketer', 'Asian fuel oil cracks', 'fluid catalytic cracker', 'diesel desulphurization unit', 'sulfurous quality peer', 'wide Brent-Dubai exchange', 'three consecutive months', '140kbpd Daura refinery', 'Vienna nuclear talks', 'Arab Super Light', 'Arab Extra Light', 'aggressive pricing policy', 'light sweet crudes', 'European official prices', 'Middle Eastern OSPs', 'US-bound price decreases', 'tender-based gasoline imports', 'East Asian refiners', '210kbpd Basrah refinery', 'demand outstripping supply', 'Dubai cash-futures spread', 'July Pricing Hope', 'Basrah Heavy prices', 'light sweet grades', 'Asia-bound July OSPs', 'sizeable US exports', 'Kirkuk July OSP', 'Saudi Aramco OSPs', 'gasoline cracks', 'oil prices', 'Iraqi pricing', 'Asian OSPs', 'Iraqi exports', 'Iraqi OSPs', 'refinery upgrade', 'gradual return', 'Oil Pipeline', 'Asian demand', 'Iraqi grades', 'sizeable amount', 'Bitcoin Prices', 'many refiners', 'latest OSPs', 'price increases', 'price setting', 'gasoline production', 'Basrah loadings', 'July hike', 'Demand Recovery', 'third wave', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'North America', 'several instances', 'intra-day trading', 'global benchmark', 'global recovery', 'medium grades', 'month increase', 'surprise element', 'key parameter', 'outlier grade', 'primary reason', 'ICE Bwave', 'main factors', 'medium-heavy sour', 'West Africa', 'long-haul voyages', 'solid profits', 'heavier side', 'medium-heavy grades', 'month hikes', 'peculiar trends', 'solid variant', 'final destination', 'United States', 'month cuts', 'noteworthy trend', 'downstream sector', 'similar scope', 'different split', 'export grades', 'five rounds', 'pre-sanctions era', 'Indian companies', 'freight terms', 'payment deadlines', 'tanker fleet', 'other Midd', 'OSP hikes', 'Brent settlements', 'market indicator', 'arbitrage barrels', 'Dated Brent', '10-50 cents', '15-20 cents', '15-40 cents', '10-15 cents', 'Spot differentials', 'marginal changes', 'barrel mark', 'barrel premium', 'barrel discount', 'Northwest Europe', 'Iranian barrels', 'Oman/Dubai average', '10 cents', 'May', 'threshold', 'sequence', 'events', 'summer', 'thrust', 'heels', 'extent', 'Murban', 'June', 'Graph', 'vs', 'swaps', 'EFS', 'sort', 'convalescing', 'Story', 'SOMO', 'footsteps', 'regards', 'revival', '220kbpd', 'point', 'back', 'rebound', 'board', 'place', 'Baghdad', 'domestic', 'construction', 'volume', 'government', 'year', 'readiness', '2018 credit', 'NIOC', 'privilege', '$3']",2021-06-14,finance.yahoo.com,ICE Clear Europe

Allied supply convoys were being continuously threatened by German U-boats and Luftwaffe aircraft, and when Italy’s Regia Marina introduced submarines into the mix when they entered the war in June of 1940, Allies were exhausting every idea possible to protect lives along with invaluable resources. Enter Winston Churchill, an unmatched powerhouse of a leader during the war who, in this instance, spearheaded a project more akin to a fictional Bond villain than a 1940’s combat strategy.The idea itself was simple enough in theory: create an aircraft carrier using as many natural resources as possible, in an attempt to mitigate the high cost of materials like steel, which was in short supply. Pike’s solution was ambitious to say the least. Instead of costly materials that were in high demand, he’d build his aircraft carrier out of one of the most plentiful materials on earth: water, or more accurately, ice.Invented by an outside-the-box thinkerThe concept came from British journalist, educator, and inventor, Geoffrey Pyke. Pyke was no stranger to the perils of war, having been in a German internment camp during WWI after being caught traveling there using someone else’s passport, in an attempt to work as a war correspondent. He had been arrested just six days after he arrived, and spent over 100 days in solitary confinement before escaping. Despite his continued contributions to both war efforts, he would go on to struggle both personally and professionally, before committing suicide in 1948 at age 54. The British paper “The Times” printed his obituary, which included, “The death of Geoffrey Pyke removes one of the most original if unrecognized figures of the present century.”The aircraft carrier would be the second significant proposal Pyke would make during WWII. The first was following Germany’s invasion of Norway, when it became clear there needed to be a better way to transport troops through the snow and another difficult-to-traverse terrain. Project Plough was Pyke’s motion to build a screw-propelled vehicle, based loosely off of old patents for Armstead snow motor vehicles. It would be the first time he would get the attention of Louis Mountbatten, the newly appointed Chief of Combined Operations. Mountbatten would bring the inventor, and his ideas, in front of Winston Churchill. Despite the interest in the project, Canada and the U.S. beat Britain to the punch when they began producing the M28 (then T15) and M29 Weasel, both inspired by Pyke’s original design.It wouldn’t be long before Pyke and Churchill would see eye to eye on another idea. Project Habakkuk, as it would be known, was supposed to be the answer to the increased presence and efficacy of Allied air forces in the Atlantic.Pyke chose the name based on the bible verse Habakkuk 1:5, which reads as hubristic optimism for the success of the project.King James Bible version:“Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.”New International Version (NIV):“Look at the nations and watch – and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.”Project HabakkukWhat would Pike’s Habakkuk apart from traditional aircraft carriers was the fact that it would be made almost entirely of a combination of ice and wood pulp. Eventually dubbed ‘Pykrete’ (named dually after Pyke and its strength compared to concrete), these two materials would become the main focus of his research and development. With the help of molecular biologist, glacial expert, and eventual Nobel Prize-winning protein chemist Max Perutz, and a hidden refrigerated meat locker underneath London’s Smithfield Meat Market, Pyke was able to fine-tune the functionality of the pykrete, while also discovering some of its unavoidable challenges.RELATED: AN-1: AMERICA’S PLAN FOR SUBMARINE AIRCRAFT CARRIERSPerutz determined 14% sawdust or wood pulp to 86% ice was the ideal breakdown for structural soundness, and championed the prospective benefits of a full-scale carrier that could utilize seawater when necessary to repair damages. It wouldn’t be easy, however. Expansion during freezing made construction more difficult than Pike anticipated, and the ice/sawdust mixture would start bowing under its own weight at temperatures above five degrees Fahrenheit (-15°C).Despite the new structural considerations, a small-scale model of the Habakkuk was greenlit, and a team started work in Jasper National Park, a 4,200 square mile park within the Canadian Rockies. In addition to troubleshooting the known issues, the goal of the scale model was to test environmental durability as well as how pykrete held up against various weapons and explosives. The 60 foot long, 1,000-ton model took eight men around two weeks to complete, and seemed to hold up well enough to both nature and manmade adversaries. Upon its completion, Churchill almost immediately announced the order for the real thing, full scale, and with the highest priority of importance.A full-scale Habakkuk was a tall order, and while completion was optimistically slated for mid-1944, the supply list would prove to be a living document. The original list called for 300,000 tons of wood pulp, 25,000 tons of wood fiber insulation, 35,000 tons of timber and a conservative 10,000 tons of steel. All of this totaled around £700,000 (equivalent to just under $10.6 million today). Seasonally driven temperature changes quickly made the team realize that using steel as internal support was not only necessary, but would require much more of it than they had initially estimated. Factoring in more steel, the final proposed cost would be triple what had been anticipated, sitting at £2.5 million.A False Prophet: Issues in the iceThe project also wasn’t without some creative differences and office politics. Britain wanted to ensure America was invested in the idea, and began to phase Pyke out of the process. Back during Project Plough, Pyke had some significant conflicts with Americans working on his designs, causing him to be removed from that project well before it was ultimately scrapped. While Pyke’s exclusion had little bearing on the final outcome, the timing of it fell towards the beginning of the end for Habakkuk.The summer of 1943 welcomed more criticisms and observations, and with them, higher expectations for the carrier. With a 2,000 foot runway to accommodate the Royal Navy’ heavy bombers, and 40-foot thick walls to withstand torpedos, the Habakkuk carrier would end up displacing 2,000,000 tons of water (compared to the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class carrier, which at just over 1,000 feet, only displaces about 100,000 tons). It was also expected to have a 7,000 mile range and be able to handle the highest recorded waves on the open sea. However, its immense size, along with concerns about speed and steering, soon made it more and more clear that the odds may be stacked against Pike’s Habakkuk.The last meeting about the build took place in December of 1943. By this time, a number of factors had changed in regards to the war itself, and that, coupled with the challenges they were already facing, ended up being the final nail in the coffin for the project. Portugal had given the Allies permission to use their airfields in the Azores, which allowed them the opportunity of deploying more airborne U-boat patrols over the Atlantic.An increased number of traditional aircraft carriers, as well as newly introduced and integrated long-range fuel tanks that allowed for longer flight times over the Atlantic, essentially made the Habakkuk obsolete before it could even take shape. The prototype found its final resting place at the bottom of Jasper’s Lake Patricia.In his collection of essays titled, “I Wish I’d Made You Angry Earlier: Essays on Science, Scientists and Humanity,” Pertuz concluded:“The US Navy finally decided that Habakkuk was a false prophet.”Myth Busting: The return of the HabakkukWhile the world never got to see the larger-than-life, movie-villain-worthy tactical ice island, there were two special effects experts who decided to put Pyke’s pykrete to the test.In a 2009 episode of MythBusters (ep. 115 “Alaska Special”), fabrication wizards Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman wanted to explore the validity of some of the claims made about pykrete. The first was the idea that it was bulletproof, which the two believed they confirmed after their test of firing .45 caliber rounds into a block of solid ice, which shattered on impact, and a block of their own pykrete, which only sustained a 1-inch deep gash when it was hit.The second “confirmed” theory was that pykrete was inherently stronger than ice on its own. Through a mechanical stress test using a cantilever, Adam and Jamie found that the solid ice broke at only 40lbs of pressure, while their pykrete supported all 300lbs – and a few hits with a hammer- before it fractured.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.04,0.82,True,English,"['Luftwaffe', 'Regia Marina', 'Allies', 'The Times']","['Project Habakkuk', 'Aircraft Carrier', 'Churchill', 'Plan', 'Ice', 'eventual Nobel Prize-winning protein chemist Max Perutz', 'King James Bible version', 'Armstead snow motor vehicles', 'New International Version', 'longest military campaign', 'fictional Bond villain', 'second significant proposal', 'Allied air forces', 'refrigerated meat locker', 'Smithfield Meat Market', 'Jasper National Park', '4,200 square mile park', 'many natural resources', 'German internment camp', 'new structural considerations', 'Allied supply convoys', 'five degrees Fahrenheit', 'bible verse Habakkuk', 'traditional aircraft carriers', 'SUBMARINE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS', 'invaluable resources', 'German U-boats', 'structural soundness', 'short supply', 'five years', 'Luftwaffe aircraft', 'high cost', 'eight months', 'Regia Marina', 'unmatched powerhouse', 'combat strategy', 'high demand', 'British journalist', 'solitary confinement', 'British paper', 'The Times', 'unrecognized figures', 'present century', 'traverse terrain', 'screw-propelled vehicle', 'old patents', 'first time', 'Combined Operations', 'U.S.', 'M29 Weasel', 'hubristic optimism', 'main focus', 'molecular biologist', 'glacial expert', 'unavoidable challenges', 'ideal breakdown', 'prospective benefits', 'full-scale carrier', 'ice/sawdust mixture', 'small-scale model', 'Canadian Rockies', 'environmental durability', 'Winston Churchill', 'costly materials', 'plentiful materials', 'two materials', 'five days', 'Project Plough', 'Louis Mountbatten', 'original design', 'war correspondent', 'war efforts', 'Project Habakkuk', 'Geoffrey Pyke', 'wood pulp', '100 days', 'theory', 'attempt', 'steel', 'Battle', 'Atlantic', 'WWII', 'Italy', 'submarines', 'June', 'Allies', 'lives', 'leader', 'instance', 'Pike', 'solution', 'earth', 'water', 'box', 'thinker', 'concept', 'educator', 'inventor', 'stranger', 'perils', 'someone', 'passport', 'contributions', 'suicide', 'age', 'obituary', 'death', 'Germany', 'invasion', 'Norway', 'troops', 'motion', 'attention', 'Chief', 'ideas', 'front', 'interest', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'punch', 'M28', 'eye', 'answer', 'increased', 'presence', 'efficacy', 'name', 'success', 'heathen', 'regard', 'work', 'NIV', 'nations', 'something', 'fact', 'combination', 'strength', 'concrete', 'research', 'development', 'help', 'London', 'functionality', 'pykrete', 'AMERICA', 'PLAN', '14% sawdust', '86% ice', 'Expansion', 'freezing', 'construction', 'weight', 'temperatures', 'team', 'addition', 'issues', 'goal', '1940']",2021-06-09,nationalinterest.org,ICE Clear Europe

Johnson said that the U.K. and the U.S. have an “indestructible relationship.”The government invited all the senior members of the British royal family to greet their international guests in Cornwall, including Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Wessex, and the Queen.Then, in glorious sunshine beside Carbis Bay on the English Southern coast, Biden basked in the welcome of the leaders of the G-7 countries, which represent the world’s most stable, prosperous, and liberal democracies. The president seized the opportunity to reassert U.S. leadership in the democratic world and to promote transatlantic cooperation.Biden said: “America is back in the business of leading the world alongside nations which share our mostly deeply held values. I think we’ve made progress in reestablishing credibility among our closest friends.”Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

The leaders of Australia, South Africa, and South Korea came to Cornwall, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi joining by video link due to the COVID-19 emergency in India.Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the NewsletterThere was a great deal in the summit’s discussions and in its final communique that was pertinent to Asia. Particularly significant was the announcement of a global infrastructure plan, to give developing countries an alternative to doing business with China through its Belt and Road Initiative. The G-7 will offer financing for infrastructure, from railways to wind farms.AdvertisementJohnson said, “We have a responsibility to help developing countries reap the benefits of green growth, through a fair and transparent system.” He pledged to “turbocharge” a shift toward renewable energy, powered by advanced technology.This ambition aligns closely with the policies of the governments of South Korea and Japan, who hope their multinational corporations will benefit from a surge in green investment.Notably, South Korea’s presidential office revealed that President Moon Jae-in had a brief conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide in Cornwall. The two leaders said they were glad to see each other.It was the first time they had exchanged words in person since Suga took office last September. The two Northeast Asian neighbors have seen their relationship ice over in the past three years, following disagreements over historical issues dating to Japan’s colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula. The Moon-Suga meeting, however, followed a recent court ruling in Seoul that restricts plaintiffs from suing Japanese corporations in relation to historic allegations of forced labor and exploitation, which raised some hopes for a resolution to the current standoff.There was a much more substantive conversation between Suga and Macron, who agreed on closer cooperation in security, technology, and on North Korea, according to NHK. During the meeting, Suga welcomed France’s stronger engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, including deployment of its navy.North Korea was also one of the topics covered in a telephone call from Cornwall by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the top Chinese diplomat, Yang Jiechi.The State Department said the two “discussed the United States’ comprehensive DPRK policy review, focusing on the need for the United States and the PRC to work together for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.Blinken and South Korea’s Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong also held a meeting in Cornwall, in which they “reaffirmed commitment to close cooperation between and among the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan on a broad range of issues” according to the State Department.Blinken also used his call to Yang to speak bluntly on a range of concerns. He repeated Washington’s accusation that the Chinese government is committing “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity” in Xinjiang and asked China to cease its pressure campaign against Taiwan and peacefully resolve cross-strait issues.In response, Yang urged the United States to respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, not to interfere in China’s internal affairs under any pretext, and not to damage China’s core interests in any way.AdvertisementA spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in the U.K. dismissed the event in Cornwall as “pseudo-multilateralism serving the interests of a small clique or political bloc.”There was a further challenge to China when the G-7 leaders were joined by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). He seemed to endorse U.S. and Australian demands for further investigation into claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan.Referring to the millions around the world who have died, Tedros said: “This is very tragic and I think the respect these people deserve is knowing what the origin of this virus is, so we can prevent it from happening again.”He urged the leaders at the meeting to ensure that 70 percent of the global population is vaccinated by the time of the G-7’s next summit in Germany next year. Japan’s Suga is leading the drive to persuade wealthy countries to fund the COVAX vaccine program, administered by the WHO, in part to counterbalance China’s vaccine diplomacy.The final communique called on China “to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang” and pressed for a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.Diplomatic sources say the draft wording would have been more strongly critical of China if the United States had prevailed, but was slightly watered down on the suggestion of France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.Speaking to Fox News Sunday, Blinken said that last time the G-7 met in 2018, there was no mention of China in its summing up document.Blinken said the meeting in Cornwall has demonstrated that democracies “can come together and deliver for people in real ways” and he emphasized the G-7’s promise to “build back better for the world.”Following his appearance at the G-7 summit, Biden joined the Queen for a state banquet at Windsor Castle. Afterwards, he and Blinken headed to the EU-U.S. and NATO summits in Brussels before a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.59,0.1,0.31,True,English,"['G7', 'European Commission', 'G-7', 'Initiative', 'G-7', 'presidential office', 'NHK', 'State Department', 'DPRK', 'PRC']","['G-7 Summit', 'Cornwall Means', 'Asia', 'United States’ comprehensive DPRK policy review', 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau', 'Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi', 'European Council President Charles Michel', 'Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N', 'British Prime Minister Boris Johnson', 'Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide', 'Prime Minister Mario Draghi', 'European Commission President Ursula', 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel', 'U.S. President Joe Biden', 'two Northeast Asian neighbors', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'top Chinese diplomat', 'President Moon Jae-in', 'British royal family', 'new wife Carrie', 'warm body language', 'past three years', 'recent court ruling', 'U.S. leadership', 'U.S. Secretary', 'stronger stance emerge', 'Japan-South Korea relations', 'The U.K.', 'several other nations', 'global infrastructure plan', 'The Moon-Suga meeting', 'The State Department', 'Carbis Bay Hotel', 'North Korea issue', 'Several other leaders', 'Prince Charles', 'brief conversation', 'Japanese corporations', 'British hosts', 'United Kingdom', 'The G-7', 'two leaders', 'stronger engagement', 'group photo', 'St. Ives', 'clear goals', 'first trip', 'week-long trip', 'friendly talks', 'photo sessions', 'senior members', 'international guests', 'glorious sunshine', 'Southern coast', 'G-7 countries', 'liberal democracies', 'transatlantic cooperation', 'closest friends', 'full access', 'diplomatic fold', 'Donald Trump', 'looking presidency', 'fellow democracies', 'Indo-Pacific region', 'South Africa', 'video link', 'COVID-19 emergency', 'great deal', 'final communique', 'developing countries', 'wind farms', 'green growth', 'transparent system', 'renewable energy', 'multinational corporations', 'green investment', 'first time', 'historical issues', 'colonial rule', 'Korean Peninsula', 'historic allegations', 'current standoff', 'substantive conversation', 'closer cooperation', 'telephone call', 'Antony Blinken', 'Yang Jiechi', 'indestructible relationship', 'advanced technology', 'presidential office', 'democratic world', 'G-7 summit', 'China', 'implications', 'G7', 'beach', 'Cornwall', 'England', 'left', 'Italy', 'Leyen', 'Advertisement', 'alliances', 'Putin', 'meetings', 'colorful', 'government', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Wessex', 'Queen', 'English', 'welcome', 'opportunity', 'America', 'business', 'leading', 'values', 'progress', 'credibility', 'article', 'feelings', 'confrontational', 'observers', 'Australia', 'story', 'stories', 'Asia-Pacific', 'discussions', 'announcement', 'alternative', 'Belt', 'Road', 'Initiative', 'financing', 'railways', 'responsibility', 'benefits', 'fair', 'shift', 'ambition', 'policies', 'surge', 'words', 'person', 'disagreements', 'Seoul', 'plaintiffs', 'labor', 'exploitation', 'hopes', 'resolution', 'security', 'NHK', 'France', 'deployment', 'navy', 'topics', 'need', 'PRC', 'denuclearization']",2021-06-15,thediplomat.com,ICE Clear Europe

This is the Blood Qur’an, a copy of the Islamic holy book written entirely in the blood of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.The Blood Qur’an was commissioned by Saddam on April 28, 1998 on the occasion of his 61st birthday.The dictator had recently re-embraced his Islamic faith after his son, Uday Hussein, narrowly survived an assassination attempt on December 12, 1996. In an official letter published in 2000, Saddam explained that the book was intended as thanks to God for bringing him safely through many ‘conspiracies and dangers’ throughout his long political career: “My life has been full of dangers in which I should have lost a lot of blood…but since I have bled only a little, I asked somebody to write God’s words with my blood in gratitude.”To write the book, Saddam commissioned calligrapher Abbas Shakir Joody al-Baghdadi. Over the next two years a nurse drew a total of 27 litres of Saddam’s blood and delivered it to al-Baghdadi, who after treating it with chemicals to stabilize it, used the liquid to write out the 114 chapters and 6000 verses of the Islamic holy book. Completed in 2000, the finished book runs 605 pages and is written in lettering two centimetres in height with borders decorated in intricate blue, red, and black designs. The pages, mounted in gold-edge frames, were displayed in a dedicated pavilion in the heart of Baghdad’s Umm al-Ma’arik or “Mother of All Battles” Mosque. The mosque, begun around the same time as the Blood Qur’an and completed in 2001, was built by Saddam to celebrate his supposed victory over Coalition forces in the 1990-1991 Gulf War, and features minarets designed to resemble Scud ballistic missiles and the barrels of Kalashnikov rifles. The pavilion housing the Qur’an pages was largely kept locked and only opened for special guests of Saddam.Right from the start, the Blood Qur’an set off storms of controversy among Islamic clerics. According to Islamic law or Sharia, human blood is considered Najis, or ritually unclean, and anything it touches is also rendered unclean. To write a Qur’an – the holy word of God – in blood is therefore especially forbidden or haraam. Abbas al-Baghdadi, the book’s creator, was well aware of this, but could not refuse for fear of reprisals by the Saddam regime. In an interview in 2003, al-Baghdadi, who now lives in the US state of Virginia, stated: “I don’t like to talk about this now. It was painful part of my life that I want to forget about.”Controversy also surrounds the total amount of blood Saddam contributed to the project, and how much was actually used to write the book. In most parts of the world, the maximum amount of blood a person is allowed to donate in a year is between five and six units – or around three litres. At this rate it would have taken Saddam nearly nine years to donate 27 litres rather than only two. This has led some to speculate that the blood came not from Saddam but from an underling or even from political prisoners. However, as the few eyewitness accounts of the actual process are wildly conflicting, this is a question that is unlikely to ever be answered.The Blood Qur’an remained on display until April 2003, when US forces captured Baghdad. As fighting enveloped the city, the mosque’s caretakers removed the book from its pavilion and hid it away for safekeeping. Among them was Sheikh Samarrai, who even hid pages in his own house. Samarrai now serves as one of the primary caretakers of the Blood Qur’an, which is kept hidden away in a vault beneath the mosque – now renamed Umm al-Qura or “Mother of All Cities” – behind three sets of locked doors. As Sammarai explained in 2010: “I knew this would be much sought after and we made the decision to protect it. But to see this now is not easy. There are three keys and none of them are held in the one place. I have one, the police chief in the area has another and there is a third in another part of Baghdad. There has to be a decision of a committee to let you in.”The Blood Qur’an is almost never shown to visitors, kept out of sight as clerics and politicians debate just what to do with it. While the method of its creation makes it unclean and blasphemous, the Blood Qur’an is nonetheless a Qur’an and thus according to Islamic tradition cannot be defaced or destroyed. The book thus presents a serious theological quandary for Iraq. As Abdul Kahar Al-Any, professor of Islamic thought at Baghdad University, explains:“Saddam is not a holy man, so his blood is dirty. But some of the scholars say it is okay because in one of his battles, Muhammad’s warriors gave thanks for victory with the blood of the enemy on their clothes.I don’t accept this. Such a book has never been written in the time since the Prophet, so why should Saddam do it? But there are no guidelines – who among the scholars since would have thought it necessary to write rules for such a thing?”But the Blood Qur’an is controversial not only theologically, but politically as well, with many members of Iraq’s current government fearing that it and other relics of the Saddam era could serve as rallying point for Ba’ath party revivalists and should therefore be destroyed. In the words of Ahmed Chalabi, former head of the National Deba’athification Commission: “The best talent in Iraq was ordered to produce monuments which are designed to suppress the people. This is very destructive for the psyche of the Iraqi population. This is a clear reminder of the consequences of totalitarianism and idealizing a person that embodies evil. They have brought nothing to Iraq. They are not worth celebrating. They have nothing aesthetic to offer. I am for removing them.”Others are not so certain, including Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the former national security adviser who escorted Saddam to his execution in 2006: “He was there and he ruled and he impacted on the world, but he was a part of our history. He was a bad part of our history, but he made a huge difference, whether we like it or not. We need not bury the legacy of that period. We need to remember it, all what is bad and what is good and learn lessons. And the most important lesson is that dictatorship should not return to Iraq.”Further complicating the issue is the burning down of the National Library and Archives in April, which destroyed huge swathes of Iraq’s artistic and literary heritage and left the Blood Qur’an as one of the few remaining examples of native Islamic calligraphy.Sheikh Samarrai, the book’s caretaker, is rather more equivocal: “It says a lot about [Saddam]. It should never be put in a museum though, because no Iraqi wants to see it. Maybe in the future it could be sent to a private museum, like memorabilia from the Hitler and Stalin regimes.”In the meantime, as the debate rages on, the Blood Qur’an remains hidden away behind its three locked doors, one of the most confusing and frustrating relics in the Islamic world and among the strangest and most long-lived legacies of Saddam Hussein’s 24-year rule over Iraq.If you liked this article, you might also enjoy our new popular podcast, The BrainFood Show (iTunes, Spotify, Google Play Music, Feed), as well as:How Does a Muslim Face Mecca When Praying in Space?That Time Detroit Gave Saddam Hussein the Key to the CityThe Connection Between Saddam’s and Hitler’s BunkersBonus Fact:Speaking of Saddam, in 1980 America, the Cold War was still very much hot, Ronald Reagan was elected President, and the United States’ Olympic hockey team shockingly upset the USSR in what would be dubbed “The Miracle on Ice.” Oh, and the new president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was given a key to the city of Detroit.How did this come to pass?Honoring an individual with a key to the city is actually a more tangible variation of another practice known as “Freedom of the City” or, if conferred onto the military, “Freedom of Entry.” More commonly called this in Europe, the practice traces back to ancient Rome and their honoring of the sacred boundary known as the “pomerium.”The pomerium, Latin meaning “behind the wall,” was the open space just inside of the old city’s’ walls. This space was dedicated to the gods as gratitude for protection. Besides the religious significance, the authority of a Roman general was only valid outside the pomerium and not within the city’s walls. No military affairs were allowed beyond the pomerium. In fact, any soldier or general who crossed that line lost all military power and became simple civilians. The only exception was during victory celebrations, in which generals and soldiers entered the city in honor to celebrate their success in battle. In other words, they had the “Freedom of the City.”It was in medieval Europe when physical keys started being used, around the sixth or seventh century. When a monarch or ruler came upon a city or town, the leaders would greet him and hold a celebration in his honor (with dancing, food, wine…lots of wine). They would, then, present him with a real key to the city’s gate, allowing this ruler unlimited access. There was also a related custom of giving such keys to certain respected merchants and tradesmen, who could enter the city without needing to pay a tax or toll.It seems the first time such an honor was given in the United States was in New York City on June 27, 1702. Mayor Philip French (mayor of New York City for only one year) gave the Viscount Cornbury, Edward Hyde, the British governor of New York and considered the most powerful man in the colonies, “Freedom of the City.” Additionally, Mayor French declared that all those in the city who were too poor to purchase their own freedoms were given “Freedom of the City Gratis” for the day.So that’s how the custom of giving a key to the city started and how it made its way to the United States. So why was Saddam Hussein given such an honor by the city of Detroit?Hussein became President of Iraq on July 16, 1979. Six days later, he ordered the execution of twenty one Iraqi government officials (including five ministers) who were accused of being “traitors.”Hussein was technically a Sunni Muslim, though religion doesn’t exactly seem to have truly been huge part of his belief system, later blood Qur’an or not. What Hussein did value was loyalty and political support. So, when Reverend Jacob Yasso of the Chaldean Sacred Heart in Detroit, Michigan publicly congratulated Hussein on his rise to power, the compliment didn’t go unnoticed. Jacob Yasso was born in Telkaif, Iraq and after high school, was recruited to Rome where he completed his masters degree in Philosophy and Theology. In 1960, he was ordained a priest in the Chaldean Catholic Church. Chaldean Catholics are Catholics whose ethnicity stems from the ancient area of Mesopotamia, more specifically northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, Syria, and northwest Iran. In 1964, he was appointed to serve the growing Chaldean community in Detroit.In response to Yasso’s congratulations, Saddam sent the church $250,000. This came as a surprise to Yasso considering this regime had actually criticized Yasso for questioning their nationalization of Iraqi schools. According to an interview Yasso gave in 2003 with the AP, Saddam Hussein was making donations to Chaldean churches across the world at that time, so giving money to his church wasn’t necessarily out of the ordinary for Iraq’s president. Plus, Detroit had the largest Chaldean population in the United States, who predominately supported the rise of Hussein in Iraq.Yasso and Hussein kept in touch, and about a year later, in 1980, along with about twenty five people from the Detroit Chaldean community, he was a guest of the Iraqi government and arrived in Baghdad. Then, he was led into Saddam’s palace. In the same interview, Yasso states “We were received on the red carpet.” At some point during the celebration, Yasso presented Saddam Hussein a gift from then-mayor of Detroit, Coleman Young, a key to the city, which of course at this point in the practice of giving keys out didn’t unlock anything, but was merely a symbolic honor.This act of honoring of a man today generally thought of as having been a ruthless tyrant, didn’t happen in a vacuum. In the late 70s, the United States employed the well-known philosophy, “an enemy of our enemy is our friend.” Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was engaged in a war against Iran. Considering the US’s own issues with Iran, the State Department very much supported Iraq in the war. In fact, there is some evidence that the State Department actually encouraged Detroit mayor Coleman Young to ask Rev. Yasso to present a key to the city of Detroit to Hussein.In Baghdad, Saddam graciously accepted the honor and asked Yasso, “I heard there was a debt on your church. How much is it?” Yasso said yes there was, approximately for $170,000. Saddam gave him a check for $200,000 dollars, enough to pay the debt and build a new recreation hall.In the 2003 interview, Yasso went on to say that Saddam was an American puppet and once the US government didn’t need him anymore, he was no good. However, he did admit that while Saddam Hussein may have been a “good person” at some point, to quote him, “money and power changed the person.”Expand for References",negative,0.02,0.08,0.9,mixed,0.12,0.1,0.78,True,English,"['Coalition', 'Baghdad University']","['The Forbidden Book', 'Saddam Hussein', 'Blood', 'calligrapher Abbas Shakir Joody al-Baghdadi', 'former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein', 'two centimetres in height', 'The Blood Qur’an', 'next two years', 'intricate blue, red', 'Umm al-Ma’arik', '1990-1991 Gulf War', 'Scud ballistic missiles', 'Abdul Kahar Al-Any', 'long political career', 'serious theological quandary', 'blasphemous Islamic law', 'Umm al-Qura mosque', 'Qur’an pages', 'Islamic holy book', 'Abbas al-Baghdadi', 'Uday Hussein', 'theological paradox', 'holy word', 'nine years', 'political prisoners', 'holy man', 'Islamic faith', 'Islamic tradition', 'Islamic thought', '61st birthday', 'official letter', 'many ‘conspiracies', 'black designs', 'gold-edge frames', 'Coalition forces', 'Kalashnikov rifles', 'special guests', 'human blood', 'US state', 'most parts', 'maximum amount', 'six units', 'eyewitness accounts', 'actual process', 'US forces', 'three sets', 'locked doors', 'three keys', 'one place', 'police chief', 'Islamic clerics', 'secret vault', 'finished book', 'same time', 'painful part', 'total amount', 'Sheikh Samarrai', 'primary caretakers', 'Saddam regime', 'dedicated pavilion', 'three litres', 'Baghdad University', '605 pages', '27 litres', 'object', 'copy', 'April', 'occasion', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'December', 'God', 'dangers', 'life', 'lot', 'somebody', 'words', 'gratitude', 'nurse', 'chemicals', 'liquid', '114 chapters', '6000 verses', 'lettering', 'borders', 'heart', 'Mother', 'Battles', 'victory', 'minarets', 'barrels', 'start', 'storms', 'controversy', 'Sharia', 'haraam', 'creator', 'fear', 'reprisals', 'interview', 'Virginia', 'project', 'world', 'person', 'five', 'rate', 'underling', 'question', 'display', 'fighting', 'city', 'safekeeping', 'house', 'Cities', 'Sammarai', 'decision', 'none', 'area', 'third', 'committee', 'visitors', 'sight', 'politicians', 'method', 'creation', 'professor', 'scholars', 'Muhammad', 'warriors', 'thanks', 'enemy', 'Prophet', 'guidelines']",2021-06-14,todayifoundout.com,ICE Clear Europe

These events are all about those optics — charting who is on the ascent and who is going in reverse. Canada went down in history in 2018 as that moment when a fed-up Angela Merkel stood leaning forward, arms braced on a table, alongside other leaders facing a cranky Donald Trump to convince him to sign onto a communique he later ripped up anyway.Italy the previous year was all about the nascent bromance of Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau, both fresh on the scene and with wind in their sails. France in 2019 marked the debut of Johnson, who broke the Brexit ice with allies with a lovely bit of slapstick. The power dynamics can shift, and reveal a lot about the geopolitics at play.It’s been two years since they’ve all been able to come together in person. The pandemic changed everything and this year, on the rugged English coast jutting into the Atlantic, a new set of characters will join the cast while the doyenne of the group will make her last appearance.Here is your guide on who is coming and what they want.Joe Biden: The (Experienced) RookieHe’s not Trump, and for some that may be enough. President Joe Biden is also a familiar figure, having been the “veep” to Barack Obama. But this is his first summit as president at a time the U.S. is reconsidering its role as the world’s policeman. Biden comes in with the clear message that “America is back” but also aspects of “America First” are here to stay. At home, his vaccination campaign soared but abroad there is anger at the hoarding of shots — a headwind he sought to quell by announcing a plan on the eve of the summit to donate 500 million doses. He wants an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and he’s now got backing on that.Story continuesHis push to raise corporate taxes was also endorsed and while the U.K. is host nation to the annual global climate talks later this year, Biden already held his own summit on the subject. One early test will be how much support he can rally from allies to form a united front on China, poised to become the world’s biggest economy within a much shorter timeframe (in part because of the pandemic). Another will be how he responds to a more assertive approach from European leaders, who may be skeptical of his ability to deliver on long-term promises. Biden will also be looking forward to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 16, probably the defining leg of his overseas jaunt. Before that he may want to pick the brain of Merkel, the closest thing these decision-makers have to a Kremlinologist.What to expect: Biden is a welcome change, for sure, but Europeans are not yet ready to trust him completely.Boris Johnson: The Brexit ManThe British leader picked a resort where he can entertain his counterparts in the style of a traditional English seaside holiday. If only the awful weather hadn’t scuppered the best-laid plans for tea with Biden at a quirky castle on a tidal island. No matter. Johnson will show off his famously sunny outlook as he tries to sell his vision of Brexit Britain as a global nation trading across the world. Behind the bonhomie, there is serious work to be done. His team is proud of a landmark global tax deal struck in London and has its sights on efforts to help vaccinate the whole world by the end of next year.On climate change, Johnson will be relentless. He is hosting the United Nations climate summit in November and at home has set the kind of carbon reduction targets he also wants the G-7 to embrace. A proposal to do away with polluting cars will test how successful he is. There is the prospect of tension, though. On China, Johnson wants to balance criticism of Beijing’s human rights record with openness to trade and the U.K.’s European divorce has soured his relations with other leaders. A dispute over trade rules for Northern Ireland will simmer on the sidelines and Johnson’s aim will be to stop it boiling over.What to expect: Amid photo shoots on the beach, Johnson will have one eye on that summit in Glasgow. And he’ll want Biden to persuade leaders to make sure climate talks deliver a planet-saving deal later in the year.Angela Merkel: The Outgoing VeteranWherever Merkel goes these days, chances are high that someone feels obliged to give her a farewell speech. Or even worse, a goodbye present. But the German chancellor, known for her no-nonsense style, is visibly uncomfortable in such situations and, more to the point, has little time for such sentimentality. In Cornwall, given this will be her last G-7 summit after 16 years in the driving seat of Europe’s economic motor, she’ll have to suffer through some of that. But Merkel still has strong political objectives, despite the fact that she’ll cede the throne after the national election in September.High on her agenda is how to redefine the relationship with China — German companies depend on this market for their exports of high-end consumer goods — and Russia. Merkel grew up in East Germany and learned to speak Russian fluently. It gave her an edge when it came to connecting to Putin. Over the years she’s seen Russian aggression in Crimea and Syria and how Moscow stood by Belarus with the forced diversion of a plane and the capture of a dissident. She’s seen the limits of what sanctions can do to bring rogue nations to heel and she’s seen with the Trump era the end of what she calls the postwar order.What to expect: Uncensored advice to Biden and a proper show of European unity.Mario Draghi: The New HeavyweightItalians rarely have a big say at the G-7. There is a bit of an imposter’s syndrome at play because Italy always came across as a junior member of an elite club of developed countries, with an economy stagnant for decades. Historically Italy has either done the bidding of the U.S. (it owes its 1960s boom to the Marshall plan) or aligned itself very closely to Germany and France, the continent’s dominant voice once the European Union began to take form. But this time, it’s different. They have Draghi, a gold-plated powerhouse with the kind of experience and effortless gravitas many of his contemporaries will envy. During the Greek crisis, investors saw him as the one who saved the euro.When he was picked to become a caretaker prime minister in Italy, the former head of the European Central Bank immediately showed his political chops by being first off the gate to impose an EU export ban to counter the bloc’s slowness in getting its people vaccinated. When it comes to Beijing, he set the tone by reversing his predecessor’s embrace of Chinese investment. On climate, there is much more ambivalence because going green is costly and Italy doesn’t have money to spare. However, Draghi is fully aware of the reputational damage of not being on the right side of history when it comes to the environment, especially as Italy is hosting the G-20, where another important milestone will need to be set: a wider consensus on corporate taxes.What to expect: When Draghi speaks, especially on economic recovery, everyone will go quiet and listen.Emmanuel Macron: Limelight-Seeking Liberal ChampionMacron, the youngest French head of state since Napoleon, does not lack confidence. He’s an unapologetic globalist whose vision of Europe with its own army leaves even the most passionate Europhiles uneasy. When he met Trump, he gave him such a long and firm handshake the then-president’s knuckles went white. And yet, for all that early promise, Macron has had his share of stumbles. At home, protesters became a frequent presence in Paris over rising living costs and the beheading of a teacher raised questions about the integration of Muslims. Abroad, France’s complicated colonial legacy in Africa is coming to a head with the likely reduction of its military presence in the Sahel.For all the efforts to reason with Trump, Macron never really made much headway, the relationship with the U.K. has been antagonistic in light of Brexit, and his handling of the pandemic has drawn criticism. Five years is a long time in politics and he’s now facing a difficult re-election campaign with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen forcing him to calibrate his stance on immigration. With Merkel departing, Macron will seek to seek to replace her as the U.S. point person for Europe. To do so, he’ll need to earn Biden’s trust and that will involve not coming on too strong.What to expect: Macron loves to lecture — he did so as host in Biarritz — but that can be a turnoff.Justin Trudeau: Laying LowThe Canadian prime minister has been in power for more than five years. Once upon at time he was a darling of social media with his youthful good looks and can-do optimism. These days he sports a graying beard and has become something of a footnote. Trump called him “weak” and pulled out of the joint communique agreed in Quebec. The arrest of a top executive at Chinese telecom giant Huawei resulted in Canada being on the receiving end of Beijing’s wrath, and there was a bungled trip to India to boot.Trudeau has struggled to respond given Canada’s reliance on the U.S. and China for trade. He’ll get behind any initiative on China but, having been burned before, is not seeking the limelight. Canada is at the forefront of many a climate initiative and while he’d love the G-7 to get radical he probably knows by now that he’s got limited scope to really influence the debate in tangible ways.What to expect: Happy to make positive sounds on climate.Yoshihide Suga: The First TimerSuga was a long-time top aide to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who took the reins last year after he stepped down citing health reasons.

By analyzing microscopic pollen grains preserved in lake sediments, scientists are able to build up a picture as to how environments have changed over time.It is well documented that the arrival of Europeans in the Americas resulted in the spread of diseases including small pox, measles, typhus and cholera to Indigenous populations, many of whom were practicing sedentary agriculture. Archaeological and historical records indicate that this may have wiped out up to 90% of the Indigenous population, making it perhaps the most significant epidemiological disaster ever known. What is less known, however, is the impact of this so-called ""Great Dying"" on tropical landscapes that had, by this point, been managed by food producers and even urban dwellers for millennia.Researchers have recently argued in a widely popularized paper that the drastic reduction in Indigenous populations, and the cessation of their land-use in many tropical parts of the Neotropics, led to a dramatic regrowth of forest. So significant was this ecological change, the paper argues, that these new trees captured enough carbon to cause a recognizable dip in global atmospheric CO 2 levels. This global atmospheric change is not only implicated in the Little Ice Age that caused lakes to freeze over in Europe, but has also been suggested as a potential start date for the Anthropocene.Nevertheless, existing assessments of forest regrowth are based on a limited number of environmental records and have been exclusively focused on the Americas. In the new study, the research team, comprising palaeoecologists, archaeologists and historians, set out to empirically test the proposed link between colonization and forest regrowth by synthesizing and assessing long-term records of tropical vegetation change from across the Americas, as well as the often-overlooked Asian-Pacific domain of the Spanish Empire.Their analysis paints a much more complex picture of colonial human-environment interactions.advertisement""Though we were expecting a signal of forest regrowth following known Indigenous population decline, clear examples of this process were only seen in about one third of cases in both the Americas and in Pacific Asia. Changes in forest cover were, in fact, diverse,"" says Dr. Rebecca Hamilton, lead author of the study.The team attributes this complexity to the variable influence of climate, humans and geography across space and through time.""Our results suggest that dense, wet forests and highland forests were less likely to show an afforestation signal following Spanish contact,"" continues Hamilton. The authors offer two possibilities for the apparent lack of forest growth. One is that these habitats were maintained by agro-forestry prior to colonization, meaning they had never been cleared of trees to begin with. Another possibility is that these landscapes were more difficult for Europeans to access, leading to the persistence of Indigenous populations well into the Spanish period, as is documented in historical records. By contrast, isolated, water limited ecosystems, particularly in the Pacific, showed clearer signals of forest regrowth.In some cases, the imposition of European land-use policies, including consolidated settlement and population relocation, plantations and ranching, led to a lack of forest re-growth, or even deforestation.""Future studies exploring the impact of European colonialism on tropical landscapes need to develop detailed archaeological, historical and palaeoecological insights into how different parts of the tropics and their populations resisted, shaped and were impacted by processes of colonialism from the 15th century onwards,"" concludes Hamilton.The authors' work has ramifications for the future conservation of tropical ecosystems, which requires a careful consideration of historic land-use, population dynamics, geography, ecology and climate. The study also cautions that perspectives on the Anthropocene that hinge on a single time point may be overly simplistic.As the project co-lead Dr. Patrick Roberts puts it, ""treating the Anthropocene solely as a recent, single 'spike' can have the outcome of suggesting that it is the logical product of all humanity."" In fact, he argues, the work of the team and others in the tropics make it clear ""that the Anthropocene is a long-term, varied and unequal process in the tropics -- something that needs to be highlighted to develop more just, sustainable approaches to these crucial landscapes moving forward.""",neutral,0.08,0.49,0.43,negative,0.09,0.08,0.83,True,English,['Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History'],"['Indigenous mortality', 'Spanish colonization', 'forest regrowth', 'study', 'Dr. Patrick Roberts puts', 'global atmospheric CO 2 levels', 'global atmospheric change', 'Max Planck Institute', 'significant epidemiological disaster', 'Little Ice Age', 'potential start date', 'colonial human-environment interactions', ""recent, single 'spike"", 'microscopic pollen grains', 'dense, wet forests', 'Indigenous land management', 'Dr. Rebecca Hamilton', 'tropical vegetation change', 'water limited ecosystems', '15th century onwards', 'many tropical parts', 'Indigenous population decline', 'European land-use policies', 'detailed archaeological, historical', 'single time point', 'widespread forest regrowth', 'tropical ecosystems', 'ecological change', 'pollen records', 'widespread mortality', 'limited number', 'highland forests', 'different parts', 'tropical regions', 'European contact', 'historical records', 'population relocation', 'population dynamics', 'dramatic regrowth', 'Indigenous populations', 'New research', 'Human History', 'Spanish Empire', '16th centuries', 'lake sediments', 'small pox', 'sedentary agriculture', 'Great Dying', 'tropical landscapes', 'food producers', 'urban dwellers', 'enough carbon', 'recognizable dip', 'existing assessments', 'environmental records', 'long-term records', 'Asian-Pacific domain', 'clear examples', 'one third', 'forest cover', 'variable influence', 'Spanish contact', 'two possibilities', 'Spanish period', 'clearer signals', 'consolidated settlement', 'Future studies', 'palaeoecological insights', 'future conservation', 'careful consideration', 'logical product', 'long-term, varied', 'European colonialism', 'new study', 'Nature Ecology', 'new trees', 'complex picture', 'lead author', 'afforestation signal', 'apparent lack', 'forest growth', 'unequal process', 'Iberian colonization', 'research team', 'Pacific Asia', 'scientists', 'Science', 'disruptions', 'Americas', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Evolution', 'Atlantic', 'significance', 'extent', 'environments', 'arrival', 'Europeans', 'diseases', 'measles', 'typhus', 'cholera', 'impact', 'millennia', 'Researchers', 'paper', 'drastic', 'reduction', 'cessation', 'Neotropics', 'lakes', 'Anthropocene', 'palaeoecologists', 'archaeologists', 'historians', 'link', 'analysis', 'advertisement', 'cases', 'Changes', 'fact', 'complexity', 'climate', 'humans', 'geography', 'space', 'results', 'authors', 'habitats', 'agro-forestry', 'possibility', 'persistence', 'contrast', 'imposition', 'plantations', 'ranching', 'deforestation', 'processes', 'work', 'ramifications', 'perspectives', 'project', 'outcome', 'humanity', 'others', 'something']",2021-06-10,sciencedaily.com,ICE Clear Europe

Sure, you’ve got your standard dairy milk options: skim, 1%, 2% and whole milk.But in recent years, plant-based milks have become the real stars of the show, to the point where retailers have at times struggled to keep up with demand.AdvertisementMade from oats, almonds, hemp seeds, peas or soy ― the list goes on and on ― plant-based milks will probably add an extra 50 cents to your latte order, and may make you feel like you’re making a healthy choice.We know that most milk alternatives are better for the planet than dairy milk (more on that later). But are plant-based milks actually better for our health?If you have a dairy allergy or sensitivity, plant-based milk is, without question, the better option for you. But what about those of us who have never gotten a stomachache from an ice cream cone, who can easily drink a latte made with dairy milk and have no issues afterward? We reached out to experts to find out.In dairy milk, watch out for hormones. In plant-based milks, watch out for added sugars and thickeners.AdvertisementFirst things first: The experts we consulted said that when it comes to choosing between plant-based and dairy milks, there’s no clear winner from a health perspective. Both can be good or bad for you, depending on a variety of factors.For example, some dairy milks use a lot of hormones in milk production. Some plant-based milks pack added sugar and carrageenan. And then there are individual health needs.So, how can you find what’s the healthiest milk for you?“All forms of cow’s milk will contain a natural growth hormone. However some contain a synthetic growth hormone known as rgGH or rbST. ... This has been potentially linked to increased risk of several conditions, including antibiotic resistance.” - Dr. Gretchen San Miguel“There is no way to decipher which is more harmful or beneficial to human health [in general], because so many factors are involved, such as lifestyle, genetics and health history,” Kylene Bogden, a registered dietitian and wellness adviser for Love Wellness, told HuffPost. But there are ways to figure out what’s best for you as an individual.Advertisement“Cow’s milk is an excellent source of many nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, potassium, fatty acids like CLA and Omega-3s, potassium, magnesium and more,” said Dr. Gretchen San Miguel, chief medical officer for Medi-Weightloss, a weight loss chain. “The nutrient profile in plant-based milk is often comparable to milk because manufacturers fortify it with vitamins and minerals.”With similar nutrient profiles, Bogden and San Miguel both recommend becoming a label sleuth so you can better understand exactly what’s in the milk you’re considering.“All forms of cow’s milk will contain a natural growth hormone,” San Miguel said. “However some contain a synthetic growth hormone known as rgGH or rbST, which is given to cows to make more milk, not added to milk directly. This has been potentially linked to increased risk of several conditions, including antibiotic resistance.” To avoid this, look for a label that says “rbGH-free” or “rbST-free.” This includes the widely available brands Organic Valley and Horizon.As for plant-based milks, some add sugar (there is a decent amount of sugar in cow’s milk that occurs naturally from lactose), and carrageenan is a potentially harmful ingredient added to thicken and increase shelf life.“But there are many brands without this ingredient,” San Miguel said. “Some of the most widely accessible brands are Silk and 365, the Whole Foods private label.”THOMAS URBAIN via Getty Images Look carefully at nutrition labels. For instance, Blue Diamond's Almond Breeze contains 7 grams of added sugars.If you’re looking for the healthiest possible plant-based milk, pick one without added sugar or additives. If you’re looking for the healthiest possible dairy milk, choose one without added hormones.Keep your individual health needs in mindIf you’re trying to avoid saturated fat because of a heart condition, for example, you’ll probably want to avoid any type of dairy milk except skim. If you’re watching your carbohydrate intake, oat milk (which can contain 15 grams per serving) may not be the best option for you.“Focus on the base of your milk. For example, rice and oats will have higher naturally occurring sugar/carbohydrate and less fat vs. almonds or coconuts,” Bogden said. “Almonds and coconuts will have more fat and less naturally occurring sugar, because oats and rice are grains, and coconut and almonds are nuts. So, depending on your health goals ― weight gain, heart health, etc. ― you would choose your milk accordingly.”If you’re trying to make the most environmentally responsible choice, go plant-basedAdvertisementThe conversation surrounding milk choices and the environment isn’t black and white, but one thing’s for sure: Dairy milk is worse for the environment than plant-based milk.“The environmental impact of a particular ‘milk’ is determined by the climate pollution, land use and water consumption it is linked to,” Sujatha Bergen, director of health campaigns at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said. “According to researchers at Oxford, dairy milk is associated with more greenhouse gas emission, water use and land use than rice, soy, oat and almond milk. So, any of these plant-based alternatives are more environmentally friendly than dairy milk.”In that case, which plant-based milk is best from an environmental standpoint? Mark Driscoll, a sustainability expert and founder of Tasting the Future, “grades” some popular plant-based milks below.Organic hemp milk: A“Hemp is fast-growing, thrives in a variety of soils and doesn’t require fertilizers or pesticides,” Driscoll said. “It can grow with the use of very little water, pesticides or herbicides.”Organic oat milk: B“The production of oat milk results in 80% lower GHG emissions, 80% less land and 60% less energy use compared to cow’s milk,” Driscoll explained. “One issue is that a recent report showed oats are often contaminated with glyphosate at levels considered unsafe, because farmers spray Roundup on the crop right before harvest.”Organic soy milk: B“Soya is often associated with the destruction of the Amazon, however this is misleading because much of the soya from South America is used as feed in the livestock industry, not turned into milk, while soya sourced for human consumption tends to be sourced from North America, Europe or Asia,” Driscoll said. “Soya beans also use less than one-tenth of the water used in the process of making almond milk, making them a good eco-friendly alternative.”Almond milk: DAdvertisement“Almond milk production, which uses huge quantities of water from California, where 80% of the world’s almonds are grown, uses 10% of total water used in the region, contributing to a devastating drought and a significant drop in the water table,” Driscoll said. “It is estimated at 3.2 gallons of water for a single almond.”",positive,0.95,0.04,0.01,mixed,0.39,0.12,0.49,True,English,"['Getty Images', 'Love Wellness', 'HuffPost', 'Medi-Weightloss', 'Bogden', 'San Miguel', 'Organic Valley', 'Horizon', 'Silk', 'Whole Foods', 'Getty Images']","['Plant-Based Milk Alternatives', 'Than Dairy Milk', 'Dr. Gretchen San Miguel', 'standard dairy milk options', 'healthiest possible dairy milk', 'healthiest possible plant-based milk', 'ice cream cone', 'natural growth hormone', 'synthetic growth hormone', 'weight loss chain', 'similar nutrient profiles', 'environmentally responsible choice', 'individual health needs', 'plant-based milks pack', 'most milk alternatives', 'healthiest milk', 'healthy choice', 'weight gain', 'dairy milks', 'dairy aisle', 'dairy allergy', 'health perspective', 'human health', 'health history', 'health goals', 'heart health', 'Laurie Castelli', 'Getty Images', 'boundless choices', 'real stars', 'hemp seeds', 'extra 50 cents', 'First things', 'clear winner', 'several conditions', 'antibiotic resistance', 'registered dietitian', 'wellness adviser', 'Love Wellness', 'excellent source', 'many nutrients', 'vitamin D', 'fatty acids', 'medical officer', 'Organic Valley', 'decent amount', 'shelf life', 'Whole Foods', 'THOMAS URBAIN', 'nutrition labels', 'Almond Breeze', 'heart condition', 'carbohydrate intake', 'occurring sugar/carbohydrate', 'less naturally', 'one thing', 'The envir', 'milk production', 'oat milk', 'milk choices', 'label sleuth', 'many brands', 'accessible brands', 'private label', 'saturated fat', 'less fat', 'many factors', 'harmful ingredient', 'best option', 'Kylene Bogden', 'skim', 'show', 'point', 'retailers', 'times', 'demand', 'Advertisement', 'oats', 'almonds', 'peas', 'soy', 'list', 'latte', 'order', 'planet', 'sensitivity', 'question', 'stomachache', 'issues', 'experts', 'hormones', 'sugars', 'thickeners', 'variety', 'example', 'lot', 'carrageenan', 'forms', 'cow', 'rgGH', 'rbST', 'risk', 'way', 'lifestyle', 'genetics', 'HuffPost', 'calcium', 'potassium', 'CLA', 'Omega-3s', 'magnesium', 'chief', 'Medi-Weightloss', 'manufacturers', 'vitamins', 'minerals', 'increased', 'Horizon', 'lactose', 'Silk', 'instance', 'Blue', 'Diamond', '7 grams', 'additives', 'mind', 'type', '15 grams', 'serving', 'rice', 'higher', 'coconuts', 'grains', 'conversation']",2021-06-16,huffpost.com,ICE Clear Europe

This is the electric vehicle that’s not only reduced your transport running costs and made your daily commute safer, it’s also helped reduce impact on the environment and relieve pressure on the national electricity grid.You can’t remember the time when you heard the traffic roaring past on the nearby highway, and you think fondly of your friend who has built a business repurposing second-life car batteries, and how he’s successful and employing people in a business that didn’t exist five years ago. This is a future that’s possible if South Africa takes advantage of the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition’s ideas suggested in “The South African Road to Production of Electric Vehicles (The Roadmap)”, published for public consultation in May 2021. The roadmap sets out a vision that could transform parts of our economy in some exciting and surprising ways, giving the country’s 15 internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturing plants their own roadmap to a sustainable future after Europe’s phase out of ICE cars comes into effect from 2030.Ivan Reutener If you’re wondering how a move towards electric vehicles could happen, and how they could change so much in our environment when they’re priced beyond most people’s affordability, take a moment to look beyond the ’now“ and into the future: All imported vehicles (and their components) attract an 18% taxation but because electric vehicles are considered to be a luxury item, they attract a 25% taxation plus a further 15% ad valorem tax – and it’s this that puts them well beyond the reach of regular car owners. More people could buy electric vehicles if they were no longer considered to be a luxury. Engaging with the government to encourage it to adapt its regulations about electric vehicles could make them more affordable. If the parts for electric vehicles were more affordable, local manufacturers would be more likely to make them, which in turn would make them even more affordable. More job opportunities would be created, and more diverse skills learnt.Electric vehicles don’t have ICE, which means that they have fewer moving parts, and they don’t need servicing as often. Even better, electricity is vastly less expensive than petrol, so running costs are much lower too. Electric vehicles are more affordable than ICE vehicles to run, and if they were more affordable to buy too, public transport services could use them – meaning that South Africa’s most financially stressed people – public transport users – could have lower transport costs. If you’re worried about a consistent energy supply to charge your electric vehicle, don’t be. Battery technology continues to improve, and it’s even possible for electric vehicle batteries to lighten the load off the grid by powering homes at peak times when electricity demand is high. It’s even possible for setups like these to sell power back into the grid – if regulation allows it.Electric vehicles include a wide range of safety technology, which means that they’re able to warn drivers of upcoming hazards or changes in road conditions. The early warnings could prevent accidents and save lives – and reduce the demand on South Africa’s Road Accident Fund too.

NALCAB provided direct emergency financial assistance to Latinx-led nonprofit affordable housing providers to keep 2,000 Latinx families in their homes during the height of the economic crisis.The firm is also expanding innovative housing models aimed to lower the cost of affordable housing production.

It's part of a broader $30 billion pledge announced last October to ease racial inequality.A $156 billion problemDiscrimination in the housing industry is both a result of and a contributor to America's massive racial wealth gap. That's because buying a home requires savings for a down payment (and these days, even all-cash offers ), and owning a home is the most common way to build wealth.Homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are valued on average $48,000, or 23%, less than those with few or no Black residents, according to a 2018 Brookings Institution analysisThat gap existed even after the researchers controlled for differences in schools, crime and other neighborhood characteristics. This problem has amounted to $156 billion in cumulative losses, Brookings found.""Discrimination and bias in appraisals contribute to inequity in housing values and adversely affect a critical source of wealth accumulation for minority families,"" Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, said Tuesday at a virtual event on home appraisal bias. ""The impact is large and cannot be ignored.""Worse than before redlining was bannedThe appraisal gap is just one part of the overarching inequality that exists in housing.The Black homeownership rate is just 42% in the United States today, compared with 72% for White Americans, according to the Urban Institute. Incredibly, that 30-percentage-point gap is larger than it was in 1968 — when housing discrimination was legal.In a new policy paper, JPMorgan warned that ""worsening housing market conditions,"" including a shortage of affordable homes, rising prices and barriers to down payments, ""have put sustainable homeownership further out of reach for many Americans,"" especially Black and Latinx people and low-income families.""The hill is very steep,"" said Jesse Van Tol, CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a group that promotes fairness in banking and housing. ""I don't think we've even begun to put a dent in that program.""Appraisal industry 'needs to be revamped'JPMorgan said other potential reforms to the appraisal industry include establishing new ""anti-bias training requirements"" for appraisers, allowing equal access to valuation data and techniques and creating new national standards for valuation methods.""It's an industry that really needs to be revamped, utilizing less judgment and more data,"" Mark O'Donovan, CEO of Chase Home Lending, told CNN Business.To promote that revamping, JPMorgan said it made a $1 million philanthropic investment in Ashoka and Brookings to launch a challenge that will study innovations to help narrow the appraisal gap.The experience of Carlette Duffy put an exclamation point on these appraisal problems.The appraised value of Duffy's Indianapolis home more than doubled after she concealed she is Black by removing family photos and other items that indicated her race. Duffy had a White friend pose as her brother and meet the appraiser, and only communicated via email.""The fact that I had to remove myself from my home in order for my home to have value — that's the part that really hurts,"" Duffy told CNN's New Day last month. ""It felt dehumanizing, it felt demoralizing.""Less than 2% of appraisers are BlackJPMorgan and other big banks have been criticized for relying on discriminatory appraisals.In March, JPMorgan agreed to pay $50,000 to an African American woman who alleged the bank undervalued her home because of her race. The agreement, approved by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, called for JPMorgan to provide mandatory training related to appraisals to the bank's home lending advisers and client care specialists.Diversity is clearly lacking in the appraisal industry.As of early 2019, 77.7% of appraisers identified as male and 85.4% as White, according to the Appraisal Institute . Less than 2% of appraisers identified as Black.""There is a lot of subjective judgment that goes into making an appraisal. That means there is a lot of room for bias,"" said Van Tol. ""Banks should be thinking about who they do business with. Are they inadvertently supporting low valuations in minority communities?""In an effort to promote more diversity, JPMorgan said it will provide mentors for trainees in an industry diversity pipeline program that aims to attract new people to the field and overcome barriers to entry.The bank also said it has hired more than 100 people to a new role, known as the Chase community home lending adviser, that aims to help people become homeowners. JPMorgan said these are not commission-based positions.O'Donovan, Chase Home Lending CEO, said the bank is trying to hire more people who ""look like the communities we are investing in.""",negative,0.01,0.04,0.95,mixed,0.1,0.1,0.8,True,English,,"['black', 'gap', 'bias', 'calling', 'reforms', 'stop', 'appraisal', 'housing', 'jpmorgan', 'lending', 'industry', 'chase', 'racial', 'exclusive', 'homes']",2021-06-16,cnn.com,ICE Clear Europe

By combining its unique set of business, data, policy and philanthropic resources, the firm aims to improve housing affordability and stability as well as homeownership opportunities for Black and Latinx households. This includes:Addressing housing stability, affordability and wealth creation: A five-year $400 million philanthropic commitment that includes low-cost loans, equity and grants targeted to nonprofits and organizations in the affordable housing space that work to improve affordability and stability for Black and Latinx households; Creating more paths to affordable and sustainable homeownership : New Chase Community Home Lending Advisor role to help more people on the journey to homeownership, and actively engaging with industry partners and regulators to find ways to address gaps in the residential appraisal process; Making data-driven policy recommendations : The JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter will partner with policymakers and community leaders to advance data- and evidence-based solutions to tackle housing challenges.“We’re trying to address some of the barriers to affordable housing and homeownership to help provide family stability and build generational wealth for Black and Latinx families,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Whether you rent or own your home, more families deserve fair, sustainable and accessible options and businesses have a responsibility to develop housing solutions for those who lack access to opportunity.”1. Addressing Housing Stability, Affordability and Wealth CreationJPMorgan Chase’s five-year, $400 million philanthropic commitment will help tackle the housing crisis for Black and Latinx households. The firm will launch new housing initiatives to advance affordability and stability in underserved communities across the U.S.:Working with the Urban Institute to identify, test and scale innovative affordable housing solutions, such as eviction prevention programs and ways to address appraisal gaps, to better serve Black and Latinx households;to identify, test and scale innovative affordable housing solutions, such as eviction prevention programs and ways to address appraisal gaps, to better serve Black and Latinx households; Collaborating with Center for Community Investment at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy to advance solutions such as preserving affordability of existing homes and expanding community ownership models in Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans and Seattle.Due to the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need to help stabilize housing for Black, Latinx and other households of color. JPMorgan Chase will:Provide philanthropic support to nonprofits that fund foreclosure and eviction programs such as emergency financial assistance, rental repayment plans and negotiation support;Provide liquidity – including emergency financial assistance -- to nonprofit providers of affordable housing and to small landlords facing their own financial strains;Advance effective housing preservation models to maintain existing affordable units, such as protecting small buildings at risk of losing affordability.JPMorgan Chase Institute research has shown almost one in four renters experienced a greater than 10 percent drop in total income during the pandemic, even after accounting for government support, but did not have a forbearance safety net like homeowners, which creates economic vulnerabilities for both renters and landlords. The firm is working with the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB) to provide support to renters affected by the pandemic and at risk of evictions. NALCAB provided direct emergency financial assistance to Latinx-led nonprofit affordable housing providers to keep 2,000 Latinx families in their homes during the height of the economic crisis.""This announcement underscores JPMorgan Chase's understanding of systemic issues of inequity and their commitment to driving economic justice. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt in waves, and we are on the brink of an even deeper affordable housing crisis than currently exists,” said Marla Bilonick, NALCAB President and CEO. “NALCAB is pleased to work with our member organizations to provide emergency financial assistance to ensure that 2,000 Latino families are able to stay in their homes. Nothing could be more critical to recovery than ensuring stable housing and JPMorgan Chase has risen to the occasion, once again.""The firm is also expanding innovative housing models aimed to lower the cost of affordable housing production. For example, the firm recently made an equity investment in Factory_OS, which is reducing the cost and time of multifamily housing production by up to 40% through the utilization of offsite factory construction.2. Creating More Paths to Affordable and Sustainable HomeownershipChase’s Home Lending business is focused on four key pillars to help address the barriers to affordable and sustainable homeownership: hiring people, expanding its presence, enhancing its products, and participating in policy reform.Hiring people and expanding its presence: Chase is expanding its traditional home lending advisor network to include a new job called “Community Home Lending Advisor,” which is designed to be located in minority and low-to- moderate income communities. These individuals are experts in local housing and down payment assistance programs. To date, Chase has hired more than 100 Community Home Lending Advisors nationwide and will continue to expand.Enhancing its products: Chase offers an array of products and programs that span the full economic spectrum. To address two of the biggest barriers to affordable lending, Chase expanded its Homebuyer Grant program to $5,500 to help more customers with closing costs and down payment assistance when buying a home in more than 6,700 minority communities nationwide.Participating in policy reform: The Home Lending business is also actively engaging with industry partners and regulators to find ways to address gaps in the residential appraisal process, including:Promoting increased diversity in the appraisal industry: JPMorgan Chase is providing mentors for trainees in the Appraiser Diversity Pipeline Initiative. This initiative, led by the Appraisal Institute and Fannie Mae, is designed to attract new people in the field, help trainees overcome common barriers to entry and foster diversity.JPMorgan Chase is providing mentors for trainees in the Appraiser Diversity Pipeline Initiative.

Investing in innovation: JPMorgan Chase made a $1 million philanthropic investment in Ashoka and Brookings – two organizations known for their innovative, independent and data-driven analysis – to launch the Valuing Homes in Black-Majority Neighborhoods challenge to collect and study the most promising innovations to help address the appraisal gap.“We’re taking a comprehensive approach to address what is a very complex challenge in this country,” said Mark O’Donovan, CEO of Chase Home Lending. “We are hoping to see meaningful impact for the people who need it most and will continue partnering with the public sector – at the federal, state and local levels – to ensure that’s the case.”3. Advancing Data-Driven Policy SolutionsThe JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter released new data-driven policy recommendations to improve household stability weakened by the pandemic and increase the availability of and equitable access to affordable housing for renters and homeowners, particularly Black and Latinx households. Among its recommendations, the firm will help advance:Addressing the affordable rental supply gap by preserving existing and producing new affordable units and stabilizing vulnerable renters;Implementing effective and targeted rental assistance to households and landlords most economically impacted by the pandemic recession;Incentivizing eviction reforms that improve outcomes for tenants and landlords and establishing a national eviction tracking database;Building on COVID-19 protections to effectively support homeowners, such as establishing permanent foreclosure prevention support that offers legal counseling to distressed homeowners;Promoting reforms to increase mortgage market liquidity and improve access to affordable, sustainable mortgages that better serve people of color and low-income borrowers;Advancing federal housing policies that advance fair housing and mitigate bias in the home valuation process.The firm will work to advance these policy reforms and work with policymakers to support housing stability and affordability for households in need.“Businesses, community leaders and policymakers need to work together to advance solutions that address housing instability and bring foundational change to the housing market,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter and Co-Head of Global Philanthropy. “These data-driven policy reforms will help families across the country who have previously been locked out of stable, affordable housing.”About JPMorgan ChaseJPMorgan Chase & Co.

However, as it became clear that the EV market was not going to explode as quickly as forecast, many of these stocks have disappointed to date.Nevertheless, there’s no such thing as a sure thing. But there are some current SPAC offerings that appear to have a bright future. Here are three picks that should be on your watch list.PIoneer Merger Corp. (PACX)The first SPAC on this list is Pioneer Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:PACX) which is bringing the savings and investing app Acorn public. Financial technology (fintech) is one of the hottest sectors in the market. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon recently acknowledged that fintech is disrupting the traditional banking system.Acorn’s signature product is a mobile app for savings and investing. The company’s signature offering lets customers automatically invest the spare change from their debit or credit card purchases directly into index funds. However in recent years, it has expanded its services to include traditional banking products, a debit card and even an automated retirement account service.The deal is valued at approximately $2.2 billion and is expected to close in the second half of 2021. Acorn will trade on the NASDAQ exchanged under the ticker symbol OAKS.Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp (KCAC.N)The next SPAC on our list is Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. (NYSE:KCAC). Kensington is known for bringing many companies public (hence the .N in the above ticker). This time around the company is eyeing Wallbox, the Spanish electric vehicle charger maker.This is an interesting SPAC because it is “competing” in a sense with another SPAC, TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp. (NYSE:TPGY), that is bringing public EVBox, the largest EV charging company in Europe. Wallbox could be the first European company to go public in the EV charging space.This is not an area without risk. In the United States, ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) stock has so far failed to live up to its hype. Nevertheless, electric vehicles are already more widely available and accepted in Europe and a larger infrastructure will still be needed for widespread adoption.DPCM Capital Inc. (XPOA)The last SPAC on our list is DPCM Capital Inc. (NYSE:XPOA). This company is bringing Jam City, the mobile game developer public. As part of the merger, Jam City is acquiring Ludia Inc., a game publisher based in Montreal. Ludia makes games based on the “Jurassic World” movie franchise.The optimism surrounding the deal can be summed up in one word, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). Since going public via a direct listing in March 2021, RBLX stock has surged lately.Jam City has had a history of acquiring new companies as well as developing its own games in-house.t And the company has a multiyear gaming agreement in place with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The purpose of the SPAC is to generate the additional capital that it needs to fuel even greater growth. For example, the company is projecting $1 billion in booking revenue after the merger is finalized. That compares to the $471 million the company recorded in 2019.Featured Article: What is a Buy-Side Analyst?Companies Mentioned in This ArticleCompany MarketRank™ Current Price Price Change Dividend Yield P/E Ratio Consensus Rating Consensus Price Target Pioneer Merger (PACX) 0.0 $9.91 +0.1% N/A N/A N/A N/A Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.

I like to think of it broadly as being about connection. It’s about devices that can connect with each other, and with the internet. And this provides users with the solutions that are making our lives more convenient.The most basic, and ubiquitous, example of an IoT device is the smartphone that many of us have with us at all times. But think about what that has led to. Home assistants, security cameras, fitness apps, and so much more are all enabled by the internet of things.IoT took on even more importance in the pandemic as businesses had to find a way to ensure the security and viability of their networks even as their employees were scattered remotely. This created demand for edge and cloud computing solutions that are also facilitated by the internet of things.And yes, this is just the start. The need for more and more data is powering demand for IoT solution in areas such as autonomous vehicles.But the good news is that this is an area that is still very much in its growth phase. And that means there is no lack of companies that you can find to trade in this sector. To help you get started, we’ve put together this special presentation that highlights seven such companies and the reasons why we believe they merit adding to your portfolio.",negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.55,0.08,0.37,True,English,,"['corp', 'example', 'spac', 'internet', 'public', 'stocks', 'investing', 'merger', 'risk', 'capital', 'company', 'worth', 'companies']",2021-06-16,marketbeat.com,ICE Clear Europe

This should not come as a surprise as society is slowly shifting towards cashless payment options. Sure, the global pandemic may have accelerated the process due to fears of virus transmission through traditional banknotes. However, we are aware that the future of financial services would revolve around cashless options with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, online wallets, and even the existing credit and debit cards.With traditional banks such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) making moves to jump into the fintech bandwagon, it is not difficult to understand why investors are looking for top fintech stocks to buy. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley also announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) to accelerate the firm’s digital transformation and future innovation in the financial services industry. If anything, technology is no longer a novelty in the financial industry, but a necessity.From here, we can see that traditional investment banks are also not resting on their laurels as they recognize the importance of technology influencing the industry. With that in mind, here is a list of some of the top fintech stocks to watch in the stock market right now.Best Fintech Stocks To Watch Right NowSquare IncTo kick off the list, we have the financial services company, Square. The company specializes in digital payments that enable sellers to run and grow their businesses. It combines software with hardware to enable sellers to utilize mobile devices and computing devices for payments and point-of-sale solutions. It has played a vital role in the digital economy and has empowered millions to shift to its digital payment solutions.Late in May, the company announced a new integration with Google Merchant Center. This allows Square sellers to reach new customers through direct product listings on Google. For example, retail sellers could add their item catalog to Google’s surfaces including Search, the Shopping tab, Images, Maps, and Youtube. In the long term, this would help Square’s sellers to reach more customers and ultimately benefit the company as well.Square also reported a strong first-quarter earnings report last month. The company’s gross profit came in at $964 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. Out of which, its Cash App generated a whopping $495 million, up by 171% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its net revenue was $5.06 billion for the quarter, an increase of 266% year-over-year. Given its strong financials coupled with the resilience shown by the company during the pandemic, would you consider SQ stock a top fintech stock to buy?Source: TD Ameritrade TOS[Read More] 4 Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch Right NowUp Fintech Holding LtdNext, we have one of the leading online brokerage firms that focus on global investors, Up Fintech. The company is also known as “Tiger Brokers” in Asia. Its trading platform enables investors to trade in equities and other financial instruments on multiple exchanges around the world. Furthermore, it offers its customers comprehensive brokerage and value-added services, including trade order placement and execution, margin financing, account management, and investor education.In May, the company posted record-high financial figures for the first quarter of 2021. Total revenue came in at $81.3 million, representing a staggering 255% increase year-over-year. Also, the non-GAAP profit was $23.5 million, 22 times that of the first quarter of 2020. Its strong first quarter was most likely due to a surge in trading volumes and increasing adoption by new customers.For a brokerage company, the number of new customers plays an important role in Up Fintech’s long-term growth. Its total number of accounts was 1.4 million at the end of the quarter, up by 88% from last year. Up Fintech also continues to expand its international reach with a growing presence in Singapore. It introduced new products and services in Singapore including its Fund Mall, Daily Leveraged Certificates (DLCs), and US-listed over-the-counter (OTC) equities. Given that TIGR stock has more than tripled since the start of the year, could it keep up its momentum?Source: TD Ameritrade TOS[Read More] 4 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Right NowVisa IncVisa is a payments technology company that needs no introduction. The company enables global commerce through the transfer of value and information among participants. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards. V stock has risen by over 20% over the past year.Last Thursday, the company, along with Airwallex, introduced the Airwallex Borderless Card for businesses in Hong Kong. Its users will be able to instantly generate and issue multi-currency virtual payment cards to pay third parties. The transaction can be done in more than 140 currencies and make payments to merchants globally where Visa is accepted. This goes to show that Visa is fully aware that the demand for virtual cards is on the high as businesses look for a modern solution to transact money and also control their finances.The company is certainly not resting on its laurels as it also partnered with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) to help businesses move money effortlessly around the world. Through its implementation of Visa B2B Connect and Visa Direct Payouts, Goldman Sachs will help its clients simplify the complexities and costs associated with existing systems. This marks an important milestone for both companies as an effort to break down traditional processes and help spur innovation in the fintech industry. All things considered, would you invest in V stock now?Source: TD Ameritrade TOS[Read More] Top Stocks To Buy Now? 3 E-Commerce Stocks To WatchApple IncTo sum up the list, we have the tech titan, Apple. Essentially, it designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players. Surely, you have heard of some of its products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and many more. Well, the company also has software applications such as Apple Pay which allows it to penetrate the financial services market.Apple Pay is designed to move consumers away from physical wallets and allow debit and credit card transactions to be made on your iPhone or Apple Watch. It works anywhere that accepts contactless payments. So, if the contactless payments symbol or Apple Pay symbol is available, then they will most likely accept Apple Pay. Over 75% of stores and restaurants in the U.S. support Apple Pay and over 99% of stores and restaurants in Australia support it too.Earlier this month, Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) announced that its cryptocurrency debit card will be compatible with Apple Pay and Google Play. The Coinbase card is a Visa debit card that allows users to spend cryptocurrency as cash across the globe. Support for Apple Pay will allow its users to make contactless payments on the iPhone or Apple Watch. All these coupled with its strong presence in a tech-driven world, would you add AAPL stock to your portfolio?Source: TD Ameritrade TOS",neutral,0.14,0.85,0.01,mixed,0.58,0.11,0.31,True,English,,"['services', 'financial', 'apple', 'today', 'payments', 'stocks', 'stock', 'pay', 'watch', 'company', 'fintech']",2021-06-15,stockmarket.com,ICE Clear Europe

JPMorgan Chase,1,PyNews API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-jpmorgan-chase-co-jpm-233348748.html,Should I Avoid JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)?,In this article we look at what those investors think of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has seen a decrease in hedge fund sentiment of late.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was in 111 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March.Now let's take a look at the fresh hedge fund action surrounding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average.,"The latest 13F reporting period has come and gone, and Insider Monkey is again at the forefront when it comes to making use of this gold mine of data. We at Insider Monkey have plowed through 866 13F filings that hedge funds and well-known value investors are required to file by the SEC. The 13F filings show the funds' and investors' portfolio positions as of March 31st. In this article we look at what those investors think of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has seen a decrease in hedge fund sentiment of late. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was in 111 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 123. Our calculations also showed that JPM ranked 14th among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.Glenn GreenbergGlenn Greenberg of Brave Warrior CapitalStory continuesAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, advertising technology one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this under-the-radar adtech stock that can deliver 10x gains.

We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Now let's take a look at the fresh hedge fund action surrounding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).Do Hedge Funds Think JPM Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?At Q1's end, a total of 111 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -1% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 112 hedge funds with a bullish position in JPM a year ago. With hedgies' capital changing hands, there exists a select group of notable hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions).The largest stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was held by Fisher Asset Management, which reported holding $1018.7 million worth of stock at the end of December. It was followed by Citadel Investment Group with a $484.3 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Gardner Russo & Gardner, Adage Capital Management, and Brave Warrior Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Global Frontier Investments allocated the biggest weight to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), around 32.13% of its 13F portfolio. Brave Warrior Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 10.85 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to JPM.Due to the fact that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has experienced falling interest from the aggregate hedge fund industry, we can see that there were a few fund managers that decided to sell off their entire stakes in the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that Daniel Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners said goodbye to the largest stake of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, totaling about $1013 million in stock, and Robert Pitts's Steadfast Capital Management was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $230.4 million worth. These transactions are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds in the first quarter.Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). We will take a look at Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

That figure was $5254 million in JPM's case. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the least popular one with only 58 bullish hedge fund positions. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for JPM is 69.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and beat the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately JPM wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on JPM were disappointed as the stock returned 5.9% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market.

""Employers across industries have come together to reimagine how they can contribute to a more inclusive economy on the other side of the crises we've faced this past year. They understand that now is the time to reimagine and rebuild corporate talent practices in a way that emphasizes equity, puts people at the center of business strategy, and creates widespread economic mobility,"" said Cat Ward, managing director a JFFLabs and leader of JFF's Corporate Leadership practice.

The Fed is not expected to announce any plans to pare its bond purchases until its August economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, though it may start dropping hints that it has started to talk about a taper. Policymakers will also update their economic projections and markets will be focused on whether they upgrade their inflation projections and see a rate hike as likely in 2023. Treasury yields tumbled last week after data showed a sharp increase in inflation for May, which some analysts interpreted as the market capitulating to the Fed’s view that recent price pressures will be temporary. Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale, said that the recent move was more likely driven by positioning as investors betting on further yield rises covered their trades. “This rally in rates seems very counterintuitive. I still haven’t found a very strong case besides perhaps the offset of positioning, people are getting out of trades ahead of the FOMC,” Rajappa said. Benchmark 10-year yields rose four basis points on Monday to 1.50%, after falling to a three-month low of 1.43% on Friday. They have dropped from a one-year high of 1.78% in March. The risk heading into Wednesday’s meeting statement is that the Fed could sound more hawkish than markets are currently pricing for, as the economy reopens and inflation posts strong increases, Rajappa said. “It seems like too much of a lull given the risks associated with a taper communication,” she said. Analysts at JPMorgan recommended going short Treasuries in the 10-year sector in a report sent on Sunday. The ""FOMC meeting could be a catalyst for higher yields, especially with valuations now appearing extremely rich, and markets priced for a slow pace of tightening after liftoff,"" they said. Another key focus at this week’s meeting will be whether the Fed raises the interest its pays on excess reserves (IOER) and on reverse repurchase agreements (repo) as money market investors struggle with a lack of high-quality short-term assets. The Fed’s reverse repo facility, which offers approved money managers the option to lend money to the Fed overnight in return for Treasury collateral, set a record $584 billion on Monday. Demand is expected to continue to grow as the Treasury continues to pare issuance of Treasury bills. Borrowing rates in the overnight repurchase agreement market were at one basis point on Monday. Some analysts say that the Fed is unlikely to make any adjustments unless the fed funds rate falls below 5 basis points, which it has so far held above. The rate was at 6 basis points on Friday.

The benchmark 10-year yield was up 2.7 basis points at 1.5161% in morning trading and had reached as high as 1.535%. Much of the movement came after the U.S. Labor Department said its consumer price index increased 0.6% last month after surging 0.8% in April, which was the largest gain since June 2009. Separately, the department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in 15 months. The increase in the 10-year yield broke a pattern of declines in recent days but left the note still below its range of last week. Several analysts said the inflation report was not a major surprise, keeping the focus on what new guidance if any might come from U.S. Federal Reserve officials next week. ""I think the market is really buying into the narrative that the rise in inflation is in fact transient because you're not seeing that necessarily being priced into fears in the bond market,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy for Societe Generale. The trading pushed up the part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations. It was at 136 basis points, about 2 basis points higher than Wednesday's close. The 10-year TIPS yield was at -0.843% and the breakeven inflation rate was at 2.354%, still near its lowest since April. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up less than a basis point at 0.1568%. The yield on the one-month note was at 0.0025%, the lowest since May when it touched 0% for the first time since March 2020.

Both headline and core measures increased in a broad-based manner. Healthcare cost rose, reflecting higher spending on account of pandemic. Rising crude prices and logistics costs have also led to higher prices, outweighing weaker demand pressures. Higher than expected outturn in inflation is likely to keep the RBI cautious.""""Nonetheless, the price pressures are triggered by supply-side disruption, which are likely to subside as restrictions are eased gradually. As such, this print is not expected to trigger a change in RBI's monetary policy stance.""YUVIKA SINGHAL, ECONOMIST, QUANTECO RESEARCH, DELHI""Looking ahead, we expect downward pressure on inflation from the anticipated downdraft in food inflation, a negative output gap limiting the passthrough from WPI to CPI inflation, along with demand side price pressures remaining in abeyance for at least the first half for FY22. Having said so, the need for the government to pitch in through supply management of food prices and/or reduction in excise duty on fuel prices to quell some of the price pressures may have turned stronger.""From a monetary policy perspective, the RBI can take comfort from the fact that price pressures are clearly cost-push in nature and not demand-led, thereby allowing it to continue to focus on reviving growth.""RAJANI SINHA, CHIEF ECONOMIST & NATIONAL DIRECTOR – RESEARCH, KNIGHT FRANK INDIA, MUMBAI""After five months of staying within the RBI's comfort band, CPI inflation for May has again shot up above 6%. The surge in inflation has been across all components including, food, fuel and core inflation. WPI inflation has also inched up sharply in last few months in response to the rise in global commodity prices.""""For businesses, apart from raw material prices, labour price has also gone up in the last few months due to labour shortage. While the demand force in the economy remains weak currently, the concern is that the supply-side factors could continue to put upward pressure on inflation going forward.""MADHAVI ARORA, LEAD ECONOMIST, EMKAY GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES, MUMBAI""The surge in inflation has been across all components including, food, fuel and core inflation.

While the demand force in the economy remains weak currently, the concern is that the supply-side factors could continue to put upward pressure on inflation going forward.""SUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANAND RATHI SECURITIES, MUMBAI""The kind of rise is quite surprising and the biggest component has been again the turn around in vegetable inflation. Prices of other food products have also gone up. Inflation is definitely a concern and the RBI is likely to be perturbed by this. But we think that with growth being the focus and the damage done by the second wave, don't think inflation will get much weightage in the policy decision.""KUNAL KUNDU, INDIA ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, BENGALURU""A closer look at the data gives tell-tale evidence of supply side disruption playing havoc with retail prices. Despite weak demand condition and inability of producers to pass on rising input costs, inflation continues to stay elevated mainly due to supply disruptions and an inordinately high level of tax on petroleum products.""""While this calls for the RBI bringing all options on the table, including a rate hike, we think that the central bank would continue to believe that the 6% plus inflation is transient and would bank on it dropping within their comfort zone soon there by likely delaying a rate hike.""""While we expected the RBI to opt for a rate hike during 2Q22, there is a high possibility of an early rate cut though we believe RBI would like to explore all options to not hike policy rate in 2021.""PRITHVIRAJ SRINIVAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS CAPITAL, MUMBAI""May CPI is a full percentage point higher than our and street expectations. What is worrying is that the surprise is not narrowly driven by food or fuel, instead it is across the board bump-up in prices. Clearly, businesses are choosing to pass on higher costs despite demand uncertainty, so to that extent we are likely to see higher average inflation this year and should exert some growth sacrifice.""""In step with global peers, the RBI is likely to look through current inflation uptick since it is mostly cost push and potentially transitory.""GARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST - INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI""Disruption to supply chains amid localised lockdown and scorching summer drove food inflation to highest sequential increase in seven months. This along with higher sequential prints in sub-indices like fuel and clothing in line with global reflation cycle and adverse base effect drove annualised CPI print to six month high of 6.3%.""""We expect the CPI prints to remain above 5% until September driving the annual average CPI to 5.2% for FY22. We, however, expect the RBI to continue to tolerate inflation prints close to the upper bound of its target as the recovery from the second wave (of the pandemic) is likely to be more gradual and subdued than first wave.""RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, MUMBAI""CPI inflation at 6.30% is way above the general expectations and falsifies the claim that higher WPI does not imply higher CPI. While statistical base is partly responsible, the sequential build up in cost pressures and disruption of supply chains due to the localised lockdowns have contributed a great deal to the retail price rise. Core inflation too has risen to 6.4%. While the RBI will continue to focus on growth, it will have to finetune its inflation projection for FY22 sooner than later.""Reporting by Rama Venkat and Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi AichOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.17,0.12,0.71,True,English,,"['rbi', '63', 'likely', 'economist', 'months', 'cpi', 'retail', 'accelerates', 'pressures', 'prices', 'highest', 'indias', 'price', 'higher', 'inflation', 'food']",2021-06-14,reuters.com,ICE Clear Europe

Nor does it expect the gap to be closed in 2022, when it reckons the world will still be 23 million jobs short of its pre-Covid path even as economies rebound.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development echoes the warning, saying unemployment will remain above pre-crisis levels in many countries next year.With so many workers still on the sidelines, it should be harder for those in employment to push for big pay increases — even though the cost of living is rising fast in much of the world as supply bottlenecks and surging demand accompany the great reopening from lockdown.No SpiralThat doesn’t mean nobody gets a raise. Wages have been climbing in the U.S. and other countries, especially in industries that are rushing to staff up again as customers return.But it does suggest that a so-called wage-price spiral -– an inflation risk dreaded by some economists and investors, when higher pay and higher prices fuel each other –- is unlikely to become an urgent global problem anytime soon. That leaves room for governments and central banks to keep doing what they’ve been doing since early last year –- support pandemic-stricken economies with more spending and low interest rates.“There still lots of jobs missing,” said Rob Subbaraman, head of global markets research at Nomura Holdings Inc. “To become worried about a wage-price spiral, I would need to see a further pickup in wage growth in the third quarter, alongside a sharp rise in measures of inflation expectations.”Many economies have seen an acceleration in prices over recent months. In the U.S., headline consumer inflation jumped to 5% in May, the highest in more than a decade. Euro-area inflation is running at 2%, just above the European Central Bank’s goal, but the Bundesbank says the German rate could rise to 4% toward the end of this year.Bond markets also suggest investors expect prices to rise more rapidly than they were before the pandemic — judging by breakeven rates, or the gap between yields on inflation-protected government debt and the conventional kind. In the U.S., the expected rate for the next five years hit a peak around 2.8% in May, and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.‘Only the U.S.’Yet policy makers continue to play down the risk of a sustained inflation outbreak, arguing that any price spike will unwind as supply-chain blockages gradually ease. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly argued that inflation pressures will prove transitory. ECB President Christine Lagarde made a similar case last week.While U.S. wages rose faster than expected in the last two months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists led by Jan Hatzius predict pay growth won’t stoke inflation, with the supply of workers set to increase dramatically over the coming months as fear of the virus wanes and a pandemic-era boost to unemployment benefits expires.In Asia’s biggest economies, price pressures are more subdued. Japanese wages unexpectedly snapped an 11-month decline in March, though not at a pace to trouble the Bank of Japan’s 2% inflation target. China’s consumer inflation is expected to stay under 2% this year, according to People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, comfortably below the government’s official target of about 3%.“Only the U.S. is presently characterized by labor shortage, rising union power, and rising wage demand,” said Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore and a former International Monetary Fund official. “Nowhere in Asia or Europe do we see such markers.”‘It Takes Years’Also set to keep the brakes on wage gains is the world economy’s diverging path to recovery. While the Paris-based OECD has revised up its 2021 global growth forecast to 5.8% from 5.6%, it warned that living standards for many won’t return to pre-crisis levels for an extended period.The Geneva-based ILO calculates that global labor income in 2020 was 8.3% lower than it would have been without the pandemic, and it warns that growth in the productivity of labor will remain at less than two thirds of pre-crisis levels.All of this has left most policy makers and economists focused on supply bottlenecks as the chief culprit for this year’s surge in prices. How long it takes to resolve those issues could determine whether they trigger a more lasting bout of inflation.“The growing risk is that temporary pressures last long enough to be embedded in expectations and trigger wage pressures,” said Klaus Baader, global chief economist at Societe Generale SA. “Since it takes years to stoke a wage-price spiral, we won’t know the final answer for some time.”",negative,0.27,0.0,0.73,mixed,0.16,0.1,0.74,True,English,,"['unemployed', 'govts', 'world', 'prices', 'worried', 'wages', 'global', 'wage', 'growth', 'pressures', 'inflation', 'wont', 'economies', 'millions']",2021-06-15,aljazeera.com,ICE Clear Europe
