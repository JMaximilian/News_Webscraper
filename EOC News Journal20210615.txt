Such a late date would leave little room for manoeuvre should the candidate fall through.If the men remain the front-runners, it may also spark questions about lack of diversity as Deutsche seeks to install more female leaders.German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer is the preferred candidate, the three people said.Weimer has publicly dismissed the idea saying earlier this year that his taking the post was “not at all a topic of discussion”. A spokesperson for Weimer declined to comment further.It is unclear whether Weimer could change his mind. His contract as CEO of Deutsche Boerse was extended last year to 2024. Regulators would not approve his keeping both posts, the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.Furthermore, accepting the position at Deutsche Bank would require him to resign from a job that paid him €6m last year — a multiple of Achleitner’s earnings.Also in the running, the three people said, are Norbert Winkeljohann, an accountant and chair of Bayer, and Frank Witter, a new board member who was until recently Volkswagen’s finance chief.Winkeljohann did not respond to a request for comment and Witter declined to comment.Vague plansAchleitner has privately sought to reassure investors that the search is under way. In recent weeks, he told investors that the new chair’s name is very likely to begin with the letter “W”, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.But the vague nature of his plans has left regulators, and some investors, frustrated.“The quicker we have clarity over a successor the better,” said Vanda Rothacker of Union Investment, a shareholder in the group.Regulators have struggled for years to rein in Deutsche Bank after numerous scandals and governance issues.The US department of justice has investigated the lender’s role in the €200bn Danske Bank money-laundering scandal, people familiar with the inquiry have said.Deutsche has also had to pay nearly $700m in fines by US and British regulators in a separate money-laundering case involving $10bn in so-called mirror trades from Russia.The bank has said it has significantly improved controls in recent years.Earlier this year, the ECB clashed with CEO Christian Sewing, demanding he relinquish day-to-day oversight of Deutsche’s sprawling investment bank, fearing he had too much on his plate.Sewing, who eventually complied, has sharply criticised the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy that has required lenders to pay to deposit money with the central bank and eroded profits.Reuters",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.1,0.1,0.8,True,English,"['Deutsche Bank', 'ECB', 'European Central Bank', 'ECB', 'Deutsche Bank', 'ECB', 'ECB', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Deutsche', 'Deutsche', 'Deutsche', 'BaFin', 'ECB', 'central bank', 'Deutsche', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Bayer', 'Volkswagen', 'Union Investment', 'Deutsche Bank', 'US department of justice', 'Danske Bank', 'Deutsche', 'ECB', 'Deutsche', 'ECB', 'central bank', 'Reuters']","['Deutsche Bank', 'ECB requests', 'chair', 'successor', 'German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer', '€200bn Danske Bank money-laundering scandal', 'The European Central Bank', 'ongoing high-level communication', 'separate money-laundering case', 'ultra-loose monetary policy', 'three German men', 'global financial system', 'new board member', 'sprawling investment bank', 'three shareholder votes', 'CEO Christian Sewing', 'finance chief', 'money-laundering safeguards', 'chief supervisor', 'money-laundering controls', 'financial watchdog', 'Union Investment', 'biggest bank', 'recent months', 'two changes', 'a year', 'The ECB', 'Andrea Enria', 'close watch', 'critical part', 'major setback', 'enough time', 'Female leaders', 'late date', 'little room', 'recent weeks', 'one person', 'vague nature', 'Vanda Rothacker', 'numerous scandals', 'governance issues', 'mirror trades', 'Three people', 'new chair', '10 difficult years', 'recent years', 'two people', 'huge fines', 'direct knowledge', 'biggest lenders', 'Norbert Winkeljohann', 'Frank Witter', 'Vague plans', 'US department', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'preferred candidate', 'British regulators', 'Paul Achleitner', 'Frankfurt', 'successor', 'term', 'matter', 'office', 'billions', 'euros', 'losses', '64-year', 'less', 'pressure', 'Germany', 'question', 'official', 'profit', 'health', 'world', 'lapses', 'problem', 'tenure', 'BaFin', 'April', 'mandate', 'special', 'monitor', 'track', 'progress', 'repeated', 'demands', 'search', 'shortlist', 'announce', 'February', 'March', 'manoeuvre', 'front-runners', 'lack', 'diversity', 'idea', 'post', 'topic', 'discussion', 'spokesperson', 'mind', 'contract', 'position', 'job', 'earnings', 'running', 'accountant', 'Bayer', 'Volkswagen', 'request', 'comment', 'investors', 'way', 'name', 'letter', 'clarity', 'group', 'justice', 'role', 'inquiry', 'Russia', 'day', 'oversight', 'plate', 'Reuters']",2021-06-11,businesslive.co.za,Euroclear
