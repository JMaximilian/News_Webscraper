WisdomTree Bitcoin (BTCW) and WisdomTree Ethereum (ETHW) each have a total expense ratio of 0.95% and are already listed on Germany’s Börse Xetra and SIX, the Swiss Stock Exchange.The listings of BTCW and ETHW on the Euronext exchanges follow a series of new developments across WisdomTree’s digital assets platform. In April, ETHW launched on Börse Xetra and SIX. Also in April, BTCW listed on Börse Xetra. WisdomTree offers Europe’s lowest priced physically-backed bitcoin and ether ETPs.Jason Guthrie, Head of Digital Assets, Europe, WisdomTree, said: “Listing on Euronext opens up more access points for investors to conveniently allocate to, and trade, both BTCW and ETHW. Since we launched our digital assets platform in 2019, we have seen a lot of development in the space. This milestone represents the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, the evolving European regulatory landscape and the latest signal that digital assets are here to stay. A willingness from regulators and exchanges to list cryptocurrency ETPs is lending further credibility to this growing and popular asset class. This development will buoy institutional investors, trading via Euronext, that have been waiting for further signs of acceptance before making their first allocations to digital assets.”BTCW and ETHW provide investors with a simple, secure and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to the most liquid and popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether. The ETPs allow investors to access bitcoin and ether without the need to hold the cryptocurrencies directly, store private access keys or interact with the blockchain or digital currency infrastructure in any way. Investors also receive access to institutional-grade storage solutions without needing to set it up with a custodian themselves.To ensure the highest level of security, WisdomTree leverages regulated, institutional-grade digital currency custodians, Coinbase and Swissquote, who maintain highly secure cold storage facilities.Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe, WisdomTree, added: “Our commitment to support investors on their journey into digital assets is reinforced with the listings of BTCW and ETHW on Euronext. We have built a best-in-class digital assets platform, made up of the most investor-friendly bitcoin and ether ETPs. Our heritage provides a level of comfort and expertise investors are unable to get from other physically-backed cryptocurrency ETP providers. This translates into a market leading product from price point through to unrivalled product structure.”WisdomTree’s digital assets product range1 has over $235m2 in assets under management.Jonathan Steinberg, CEO, WisdomTree, concluded: “We know digital assets and blockchain are top of mind for our clients and we want to help them understand and navigate the space.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File photoPARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - Pan-European financial markets operator Euronext (ENX.PA) said on Thursday that it had resolved the technical glitches which knocked out index derivatives trading for nearly four hours earlier in the day.Euronext, which runs the Paris, Milan and Amsterdam stock markets among others, said earlier index derivatives contracts had been suspended, although trading in other areas was not affected and proceeding as normal.The latest glitch in index derivatives - which allow holders to buy contracts at pre-determined prices - comes at a sensitive time for the market operator, which controls nearly a quarter of the equity trading flow in Europe after its successful acquisition of Borsa Italiana last year.It is the second such outage this year, on top of a more widespread stoppage in October 2020 when a disruption to derivatives and cash trading from Dublin to Paris forced traders to sit on the sidelines for hours. read moreEuronext said the cause of the outage, which began shortly before 0700 GMT, had been resolved and trading and the post-trade process on other segments was taking place as normal. It did not elaborate on the cause of the disruption.When outages hit U.S. markets, investors can seamlessly migrate their trading onto other exchanges, but Europe does not have any back-up system in place and the issue has become more urgent as exchanges across Europe have embarked on a consolidation spree. Euronext operates six major stock markets in the region.While trading of stocks can also be done on other platforms such as Cboe Europe, Aquis and Turquoise, traders generally use Euronext as the reference market.Unlike cash trading, which was largely unaffected by the disruption on Thursday, outages are slightly different in the derivatives market where there is less competition among trading venues.Usually derivative contracts are traded on a single exchange but increasingly other operators are also vying for a piece of the pie. Cboe Europe, the largest alternative venue operator on the continent, plans to launch a European equity derivatives exchange in September.Cboe declined to comment.In a paper published in May, Cboe Europe and Aquis Exchange proposed an industry-wide plan to respond to primary cash market outages, which would see them handle much of the process following a glitch.Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Alison WilliamsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.0,0.03,0.97,mixed,0.06,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['Euronext', 'Euronext', 'REUTERS', 'Reuters', 'Euronext', 'PA', 'Euronext', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Euronext', 'Euronext', 'Cboe Europe', 'Aquis', 'Turquoise', 'Euronext', 'Cboe Europe', 'Cboe Europe', 'Aquis Exchange', 'Thomson Reuters']","['derivatives trading glitch', 'four-hour outage', 'Euronext', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'Pan-European financial markets operator Euronext', 'largest alternative venue operator', 'six major stock markets', 'European equity derivatives exchange', 'primary cash market outages', 'earlier index derivatives contracts', 'Amsterdam stock markets', 'U.S. markets', 'equity trading flow', 'market operator', 'derivatives market', 'single exchange', 'reference market', 'derivative contracts', 'cash trading', 'Aquis Exchange', 'business district', 'La Defense', 'coronavirus disease', 'Benoit Tessier', 'File photo', 'technical glitches', 'derivatives trading', 'other areas', 'determined prices', 'sensitive time', 'successful acquisition', 'Borsa Italiana', 'widespread stoppage', 'other segments', 'back-up system', 'consolidation spree', 'other platforms', 'less competition', 'other operators', 'industry-wide plan', 'Sudip Kar-Gupta', 'Alison Williams', 'Euronext logo', 'trading venues', 'latest glitch', 'post-trade process', 'other exchanges', 'Cboe Europe', 'outbreak', 'COVID', 'Paris', 'France', 'ENX', 'Thursday', 'Milan', 'others', 'holders', 'quarter', 'October', 'disruption', 'Dublin', 'traders', 'sidelines', 'hours', 'cause', '0700 GMT', 'place', 'investors', 'issue', 'region', 'stocks', 'Turquoise', 'piece', 'continent', 'September', 'paper', 'May', 'Reporting', 'Standards']",2021-06-17,reuters.com

The global animal health market generated annual revenue of circa $33bn in 2019, of which circa $20bn, or 60% of the market, represents livestock animals. The Company is the 6th largest company by revenue in the livestock health industry (including livestock animal vaccine products), and the 2nd largest by revenue in swine and poultry animal health (excluding vaccines). With more than half a century of expertise, the Company is dedicated to offering high quality products and services to help customers improve livestock animal health.. The global animal health market generated annual revenue of circa $33bn in 2019, of which circa $20bn, or 60% of the market, represents livestock animals. The Company is the 6th largest company by revenue in the livestock health industry (including livestock animal vaccine products), and the 2nd largest by revenue in swine and poultry animal health (excluding vaccines). With more than half a century of expertise, the Company is dedicated to offering high quality products and services to help customers improve livestock animal health. Based in the European Union and with main production sites in Italy, France, Bulgaria and the United States across a total of 13 locations, the Company is highly self-sufficient; more than 95% of its finished products are produced internally.The segment of livestock animals in which the Company operates (poultry, swine, cattle, sheep and aqua) is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% for the years 2019 to 2024 (in nominal terms) according to Vetnosis - a faster rate than other animal health areas, such as companion animals, which is expected to have a CAGR of 2.5% over the same period (according to Vetnosis). The growth is mainly driven by three factors: an increase in the global population; a larger and growing middle-class in developing countries demanding more high-quality animal proteins; and increased food safety concerns and demand for higher quality standards resulting in increasing demand for better quality meat. Though there is growing trend of vegan alternatives in developed markets, the Group expects that the impact of this trend on the overall mid to long-term demand for food animal products will be limited.The Company’s leadership lies in its operational model that combines an exclusive focus on key livestock growth areas with best-in-class reliable and tailored products made to the highest health and safety standards, all based on customer proximity and service models that foster trust and loyalty.The Group has developed a vertically integrated production and supply model that stretches beyond those of its peers designed to ensure reliable, safe supplies and control over the value chain. The Company operates a client-demand driven approach, which anticipates localized and tailored customer needs and aims to ensure agility and customer proximity through a sales force of 580 long-standing sales and marketing managers, and additional veterinarians and nutritionists. The Company is commercially represented across the globe, operating in more than 100 countriesThe Company’ growth is mainly organic and achieved by extending its product portfolio through in-house developments. The Company also achieves growth through selected acquisitions that offer a strong strategic fit and high levels of synergies, such as the 2018 acquisitions of Qalian and AgriLabs in the EU and US, respectively.The Company’s diversified product portfolio focuses on high margin areas in enzymes, coccidiostats, feed additives, veterinary products and vaccines.Following investments of €160m in capacity extension between FY2018 and FY2020, the Company’s fermentation capacity is one of the largest in Europe at 10,000m 3 , which allows 90% of API needs to be sourced internally., which allows 90% of API needs to be sourced internally. Over the last three years Huvepharma has consistently grown faster than the market in terms of sales growth. This resulted in revenues of €588m and an EBITDA of €167m with an EBITDA margin of 28.4% in 2020.For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s revenue increased by 11.2% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, with all segments seeing positive growth. The sale of feed additive products was particularly boosted by the rollout of Monimax in Europe and Monovet in the US. The revenue generated from sales to the rest of the world increased by 30.9% as customers shifted supply from Asia to Huvepharma as a more reliable supplier during the pandemic.The Company’s management team includes long-standing experts with an average of more than 20 years’ industry experience, all of them having served more than 15 years at the Company.The Company has invested significantly to protect the environment. For example, modern incinerator plants have been installed to utilize the waste and biomass fuel from its production processes to generate energy. Waste-water treatment plants and a number of exhaust air filtration installations have been integrated into the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Co-generation plants have been built to ensure the supply of ecologically generated energy and steam. The Company is building solar power plants with a total installed capacity of 40MW, which are expected to be fully operational within the next two years. These plants will cover a large part of the Company’s electricity needs and are expected to reduce carbon emissions by 25,000 tons per year from 2023 onward. Significant investments have also been made and will continue to be made in environmentally-friendly packaging, with a lower carbon footprint.The Group’s business has thus far been relatively resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic at a time of global economic turmoil. While working through the significant effects of the current crisis, the Group has since 31 December 2019 traded in line with management’s expectations and the Group believes its medium- to long-term targets continue to be achievable.Kiril Domuschiev, President and CEO of the Company said: “Huvepharma is at the next stage of its development and this IPO is the natural way to accelerate the company’s growth. The IPO will further accelerate the company’s organic growth and new product developments, and also increase the company’s ability to acquire or license new products or technologies, reduce our leverage, as well as enable us to further increase our production capacity. The Netherlands is a leading European country in livestock development, and Amsterdam is the European trading venue with the highest daily turnover in the Eurozone. Amsterdam was therefore an obvious choice as a listing venue for us rooted in a country with a strong agriculture profile. I am excited about our future as a listed company.”OFFER HIGHLIGHTSThe Offer is expected to comprise a primary component of approximately EUR 300 million and a secondary component that is still to be determined.The Company intends to use the expected net proceeds of the issue of any new shares to (i) fund and accelerate its growth capex and (ii) repay part of its outstanding debt in order to improve its leverage ratio, with a targeted leverage ratio below 1.5x at the end of 2021. The Admission will further provide the Company with access to capital markets, and further increase its profile internationally.The Company expects the Admission and the Offer to create a new long-term shareholder base as well as liquidity for the existing and future shareholders. The Offer also aims to provide the Selling Shareholder with an opportunity to realize its investment in the Company. It is the intention of the Company and the Selling Shareholder to create a meaningful free float in the Shares on Admission.An application is expected to be made for the admission to listing and trading of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam.The Offer is to be structured as a private placement to certain institutional investors in various jurisdiction, including the Netherlands.The Company has appointed J.P. Morgan AG, BNP Paribas and Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG as joint global coordinators for the Offer (the “Joint Global Coordinators”). ING Bank N.V. and UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, together with the Joint Global Coordinators, are acting as joint bookrunners for the Offer (the “Joint Bookrunners”).

Within the global animal health industry, there are two distinct segments in which companies can participate that vary in market size according to Vetnosis:Livestock animal segment, with a market size of approximately USD 19.7 billion, andCompanion animal segment, with a market size of approximately USD 13.2 billionThe Group’s core operations focus on the livestock animal segment which, with a market size of approximately USD 19.7 billion (according to Vetnosis), represents approximately 60% of the global animal health industry.Vetnosis projects the global animal health industry for livestock to grow nominally at a CAGR of 5% between 2019 and 2024. The fastest growth rates over this period will be in poultry, expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.2% during the period 2019 to 2024, followed by cattle and sheep at 4.2% and swine at 3.5%. According to Vetnosis, although both the companion animal segment and livestock species segment are expected to grow, all livestock species are expected to grow faster than the companion animal segment, which Vetnosis forecasts to grow at 2.5% from 2019 to 2024.The Group believes this growth will be driven by a number of strong and sustainable factors, including the following:Increased global population.Increased global demand for protein.Significant pressure on producers to improve productivity.Increasing importance of food quality and human health security are driving the evolution of the livestock market.Favourable commercial dynamics in the livestock health industry.Significant growth opportunities driven by developing countries.By species, ruminants (which is comprised of beef and dairy cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs) are expected to remain the largest market by revenue going forward but poultry is expected to drive future growth.Vaccines are expected to drive overall growth in the market.Additional key structural characteristics of the food animal health industry that contrast favourably with the human health industry, such as time to market of new products, sustained brand loyalty customer relationships, diversified product portfolios, and self-pay markets.COMPETITIVE STRENGTHSA leading animal health company with an established global presence and a nearly exclusive focus on livestock.The Group is a top ten animal health company measured by revenue, with EUR 587.9 million revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 with an established global presence and a nearly exclusive focus on livestock such as poultry, swine and cattle (including sheep). The Group is the second largest player in poultry and swine animal health, excluding vaccines, in terms of the combined revenues in those categories. Based on Vetnosis’ analysis of 2019 revenues, the Group is the sixth largest player in the livestock health industry (including livestock animal vaccine products).The Group has a broad and diversified product portfolio and sells its products in over 100 markets worldwide. The Group has a direct sales presence in major livestock markets, which accounted for approximately 90% of its sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Group realized 10% of its sales through carefully selected distributors. The Group has strong market positions in the United States and Europe, with an expanding footprint in the rest of the world which accounted for 32%, 45% and 23%, respectively, of its sales for the year ended December 31, 2020.The Group also believes that it is well positioned in the livestock market with strong exposure to both fast-growing species and higher margin regions, particularly, North America and Europe, which are highly regulated markets.Proven ability to develop and commercialise new products in high growth opportunities.The Group has a strong culture of product innovation. In 2019, it realized over 500 new product registrations, in 2020 it launched ten new products and currently it has a pipeline of 25 new products. In the last three years, 35% of the Group’s revenue growth was attributable to the sales of new products launched during the same period, with 25% from products developed internally and 10% from two acquisitions made during this period. Consistent with its strategy of focus on value-added solutions, the Group’s new products are focused on high growth and high margin areas, specifically vaccines, veterinary products, enzymes, coccidiostats and medical feed additives. The Group’s vaccine development leverages new product lines adding to its existing coccidiosis vaccines lines. Furthermore, the Group believes that it is well-positioned to accommodate expected shifts from medicinal feed additives to non-antibiotic alternatives.Vertically integrated business and well invested asset base offering secure, cost-efficient and reliable operations, positioned to deliver revenue growth with increasing margins.The Group believes it is a leader in terms of manufacturing quality and supply reliability. The Group’s core activity is fermentation, with over 10,000 m3 of fermentation capacity in Europe, making it one of the largest and most efficient players in Europe, in terms of bioprocessing, as of the year ended December 31, 2020. The Group operates 13 production facilities in Europe and the United States, including an 8,500 m2 logistic centre with capacity for 10,000 pallets. Its strong manufacturing capabilities drive the Group’s competitive edge in terms of the quality and continuity of supply of its products. The Group’s vertically integrated model covers: each stage of the manufacturing process from development to production, regulatory, marketing, sales and services. The Company has invested EUR 160 million of capital expenditure in its production capabilities from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. These strategic investments enable the Group to capture future revenue growth and increase its margins, with low maintenance capital expenditures at 1.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.Experienced management team with strong track record supported by a dynamic talent pool.The Group’s founder-led management team is comprised of experienced professionals from a wide range of leading animal health and related industries, globally. The team has led the Group through the last 20 transformational years and has a demonstrated track record of delivering strong organic growth supported by selective acquisitions to accelerate development with a focus on returns.Track record of strong profitable growth which provides cash flow that allows for reinvestment in improvement of facilities.The Group has generated approximately 90% of its growth organically with a 14% CAGR over the last 10 years, growing from revenues of EUR 122 million in 2010 to EUR 469 million in 2020.While most of its historic growth has derived from organic initiatives, the Group has also demonstrated its ability to source and integrate acquisitions and realize synergizes such as Agrilabs in the US and Qalian to gain critical mass in France in 2018. In both cases, the Group achieved a payback in less than three years due to the synergies and operational gains that resulted from the acquisitions.STRATEGYAs a pure player focusing on the health and production of livestock, the Group aims to build on its current position to become the world’s leading livestock health company by revenue, by providing high quality products, services and support to its customers. To extend the Group’s leadership across all segments of the livestock health market, the Group has six strategic objectives:Drive profitable growth in the cattle market and further expand strong position in poultry and swine animal health markets.Expand its product portfolio through customer-centred R&D.Build future growth with opportunistic acquisitions.Leverage strong sales force to expand the Group’s offering to new and existing clients.Focus on its strength in manufacturing to drive operating efficiency.Prudent financial management with focus on returns.KEY FINANCIALSThree months endedMarch 31, Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2020 2019 2018 (Euro in thousand) Revenue 160,918 144,762 587,937 548,016 485,562 Organic growth (%) 12% 16% 7% 9% 8% Gross Profit 72,435 63,787 266,027 229,142 210,755 Gross Profit Margin (%) 45.0% 44.1% 45.2% 41.8% 43.4% EBITDA 48,768 37,372 166,745 127,086 121,965 EBITDA margin (%) 30.3% 25.8% 28.4% 23.2% 25.1% Capital expenditures (21,716) (40,141) (95,817) (134,606) (156,332) Cash conversion (%) 55.5% (7.4)% 42.5% (5.9%) (28.2%) Net leverage ratio (x) 2.89 3.69 2.87 3.75 3.24For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group’s revenue increased by 11.2%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, with all segments seeing positive growth.

Prospective investors should read this Prospectus and, in particular, should read the section on “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain factors which should be considered in connection with an investment in the Shares.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/PoolLONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Think of an exclusive poker game where the minimum bet is close to $1 million. The stock-trading version, ""dark pools"" that host blockbuster trades, are pulling in major money in Europe.Their rise has been swift.On June 24, 2016 - the day after the Brexit vote - just 3% of trades on the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise shares platform were carried out in its dark pool via so-called block trades, mega-bets of around $800,000 or more.Fast forward about four years to Nov. 9, 2020 - another momentous day for markets, when Pfizer was the first COVID-19 vaccine developer to announce it had produced an effective shot - and 58% of trades were executed in these giant blocks.The ballooning interest is evidence that U.S.-style block trading of shares is ""becoming truly mainstream"" among European institutional investors, according to Robert Barnes, global head of primary markets at LSE Group.The LSEG is one of a handful of European exchanges trying to grab a slice of the action, having seen dark pools - traditionally run by investment banks or specialised platforms - siphon off growing trading volumes from their industry.Pan-European exchange operator Euronext told Reuters it was preparing to launch its own business - Euronext Block - in coming months.Block trades are so big - EU regulators stipulate at least 650,000 euros ($795,000) for large-cap stocks - they are, in practice, too costly for investors to make on mainstream exchanges where they can move the market and take a big hit on price.Such ""off-exchange"" deals accounted for 4.2% of overall EU monthly trading volumes in February, up from 1.5% in January 2017, according to investment bank and research firm Rosenblatt Securities. Over that period, block trades in the more mature U.S. market eased from 9.6% to 6.7%.Thus business is brisk for dark pools, which match buyers and sellers away from wider market and regulatory scrutiny.Goldman Sachs told Reuters its European block-trading volumes in the first quarter of 2021 had already surpassed full-year levels for 2020, which itself had doubled from 2019. It declined to disclose volumes. Another top U.S. bank confirmed similar rates of European growth on condition of anonymity.Among other leading venues, more than $7 billion worth of shares were traded on CBOE's European block-trading platform in April, and more than $10 billion at Liquidnet, according to data from broker and analytics firm Instinet.Jason Lenzo, head of trading at London-based Russell Investments, said if block-trading volumes continued to rise, investors had to adapt. Russell has increased its share of block trades from 30% of all trade volumes a couple of years ago to the ""mid-30s"" now, he added.""If there is more block trading, then you certainly need to shift your trading strategy,"" he said. ""You want to be in the market where the liquidity is focused.""LSE AND EURONEXTThe shift towards the dark has alarmed some mainstream European stock exchanges, which are lobbying for tighter controls on such rival venues, saying they hinder transparency.Prices of deals on dark pools are only shared with the wider - or ""lit"" - market after the trade takes place, unlike on exchange where it is displayed until it's executed.Germany's Deutsche Boerse said dark pools trading could have a negative impact on price discovery, when it came to smaller-sized orders, and that this would eventually push up trading costs for issuers and investors.""Trading in the dark should be limited in order not to harm price formation in the long run,"" said Sandra Vincent, head of market structure and regulation at Deutsche Boerse Cash Market.EU regulators are concerned too. With MiFID II in 2018, they ruled that only 8% of a stock's average trading volume can be transacted via dark pools and set minimum limits for the size of each trade that can preclude all but the biggest fish.Yet the LSE's dark pool has become an important source of earnings since Britain's decoupling from the EU and its rules.Trading on Turquoise, a trading venue majority-owned by the LSE, doubled to around 241 billion euros last year compared with 2015, when the exchange started reporting full-year volumes for the unit. Over the same period, volumes on the LSE's main bourse declined 18% to 1.4 trillion euros.The block-trading business received a fillip in December when regulators in Britain, now competing with the continent for investment money, said international investors would be allowed to trade near-unlimited amounts of shares in the country.Euronext told Reuters it was taking a different tack. Rather than compete with existing players more focused on large-cap stocks, it said it was going to launch a block-trading venue for small and mid-caps, which it described as ""underserved and neglected"" in European trading as a whole.""In the next few months, I can't give a date yet, we're just onboarding offer to customers, we're going to be launching something called Euronext Block,"" said Simon Gallagher, head of cash equities and derivatives at Euronext.""In the midcaps, it could be 10,000-euro order sizes, which is equivalent to a blue-chip trade in the lit market.""BLOCKBUSTER SAVINGS?The cost savings offered by block trades are a big draw for the European investment industry, where many are already facing higher regulatory scrutiny over client fees.A block trade would have saved an investor nearly 90% of the transaction cost they would otherwise incur, according to an analysis at the end of 2020 by trading platform Instinet, which runs a European dark pool called Blockmatch. It defines transaction cost as ""the price achieved for an order vs the price available at the time you decided to make a trade or more importantly vs the expected cost"".Danny Mallinson, head of EMEA execution services at Goldman Sachs, said costs savings made block trading increasingly attractive for investors.""In the last 12 to 18 months, we have been living in a market environment where the cost of trading has gone up as spreads have widened,"" he added.With trading concentrated at the start and end of each day, increasingly thin-volume markets make transactions expensive and almost impossible to hide. Bid and offer prices are often far apart, meaning even medium-sized trades can move markets.""Some of those spreads can be 20 basis points wide or some can be as much as 500 bps wide,"" said Lenzo at Russell Investments.ARCHEGOS SCANDALIn the United States, block trades have been part of the investment scene for the best part of two decades. Many exchanges operate a dual strategy, with separate platforms focused on retail and institutional investors.These platforms usually co-exist peacefully as institutional clients trade with their peers without worrying about information leakage, while the retail investor can trade tiny chunks without worrying about large orders swamping the market.Problems can arise when these markets collide, though, as happened this year when the implosion of Archegos Capital led to institutional investors dumping large amounts of shares via dark pools. The news leaked, fuelling a selloff across the broader mainstream market, and led to some retail investors questioning why big players were party to sensitive information first.U.S. regulators are not stepping up scrutiny of dark pools directly, but are looking into the relationship between investment banks and hedge funds.Ben Stephens, global head of product management at Instinet, said the advantages of block trading, particularly electronic midpoint blocks and guaranteed prices from dealers, meant the practice was here to stay in Europe.""The opportunity cost of not trading a block vs trading in the lit market is so high that it means asset managers will continue to choose to execute blocks electronically where they can,"" he added.($1 = 0.8175 euros)Additional reporting by Huw Jones in LONDON; Editing by Sujata Rao and Pravin CharOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.18,0.13,0.69,True,English,"['Reuters', 'REUTERS', 'Pool', 'Reuters', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Pfizer', 'LSE Group', 'LSEG', 'Euronext', 'Reuters', 'Euronext Block', 'EU', 'EU', 'Rosenblatt Securities', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Reuters', 'CBOE', 'Liquidnet', 'Instinet', 'Russell Investments', 'Russell', 'LSE', 'EURONEXT', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Deutsche Boerse Cash Market', 'EU', 'LSE', 'EU', 'Turquoise', 'LSE', 'LSE', 'Euronext', 'Reuters']","['European stock traders', 'blockbuster bets', 'dark', 'Reuters', 'U.S.-style block trading', 'overall EU monthly trading volumes', 'Chinese Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua', 'top U.S. bank', 'first COVID-19 vaccine developer', 'mature U.S. market', 'Deutsche Boerse Cash Market', 'mainstream European stock exchanges', 'Exchequer Philip Hammond', 'exclusive poker game', 'average trading volume', 'other leading venues', 'Pan-European exchange operator', 'European block-trading platform', 'Such ""off-exchange"" deals', 'London-based Russell Investments', 'growing trading volumes', 'European block-trading volumes', 'European institutional investors', 'London Stock Exchange', 'dark pools trading', 'Turquoise shares platform', 'mainstream exchanges', 'European exchanges', 'European trading', 'investment bank', 'first quarter', 'European growth', 'trading screen', 'trading strategy', 'trading costs', 'trading venue', 'rival venues', 'full-year volumes', 'EU regulators', 'market structure', 'block trades', 'British Chancellor', 'Henry Nicholls', 'minimum bet', 'stock-trading version', 'major money', 'Brexit vote', 'momentous day', 'effective shot', 'giant blocks', 'ballooning interest', 'Robert Barnes', 'The LSEG', 'specialised platforms', 'coming months', 'large-cap stocks', 'big hit', 'research firm', 'Rosenblatt Securities', 'regulatory scrutiny', 'Goldman Sachs', 'full-year levels', 'similar rates', '$7 billion worth', 'analytics firm', 'Jason Lenzo', 'tighter controls', 'negative impact', 'smaller-sized orders', 'long run', 'Sandra Vincent', 'MiFID II', 'minimum limits', 'biggest fish', 'important source', 'main bourse', 'investment money', 'near-unlimited amounts', 'different tack', 'existing players', 'Euronext Block', 'block-trading business', 'trade volumes', 'price discovery', 'price formation', '241 billion euros', '1.4 trillion euros', 'wider market', 'international investors', 'blockbuster trades', 'same period', 'global head', 'primary markets', 'LSE Group', '650,000 euros', 'opening', 'Britain', 'REUTERS', 'rise', 'June', 'mega-bets', 'four', 'Nov.', 'Pfizer', 'evidence', 'handful', 'slice', 'action', 'industry', 'practice', 'February', 'January', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'CBOE', 'April', 'Liquidnet', 'data', 'broker', 'Instinet', 'mid-30s', 'liquidity', 'shift', 'transparency', 'Prices', 'place', 'Germany', 'issuers', 'regulation', 'earnings', 'decoupling', 'rules', 'unit', 'fillip', 'December', 'continent', 'country', 'mid-caps']",2021-06-03,reuters.com

We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page.(Reuters) - Five law firms, including Sullivan & Cromwell, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, are arranging a William Ackman-backed special purpose acquisition company’s roughly $4 billion deal to buy 10% of Universal Music Group (UMG) from French media company Vivendi SE.Billionaire investor Ackman’s blank check firm, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, will pick up a stake in the record label behind artists like Drake and Taylor Swift, the companies announced on Sunday.The SPAC is working with Sullivan & Cromwell and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft for guidance on the stake purchase. The Cadwalader team is led by corporate partners Stephen Fraidin and Gregory Patti Jr.Fraidin and Patti previously led the Cadwalader team that guided the blank check company's $4 billion initial public offering last July, which made Pershing Square Tontine the largest SPAC ever.UMG has turned to longtime advisor Freshfields for advice. The firm’s team is headed by corporate and mergers and acquisition partners Sebastian Fain and Dirk-Jan Smit, and financing and capital markets partner Pamela Marcogliese.The record label is headquartered in both the United States and the Netherlands. Freshfields’ team included attorneys in both countries.On the seller’s side, French firm Cabinet Bompoint and Cleary are supporting Vivendi. The Cleary attorneys include M&A partners Paul Shim, capital markets partners Jorge Juantorena and Adam Brenneman and litigation partner Jared Gerber.Cleary counts Vivendi among its longtime clients. The firm represented the media company in its legal actions against Italian commercial broadcaster Mediaset SpA over the company’s business deals and strategy. Vivendi is one of Mediaset’s significant investors.Cleary also advised UMG on securing a five-year 3 billion euro financing from a group of banks, according to a March firm press release.The Ackman SPAC's deal with UMG strays from the usual SPAC merger, where a blank check firm uses the funds raised in its IPO to buy a privately held company, thus taking it public.Theentertainment company instead plans to separate from Vivendi and list on the Euronext Amsterdam in late September, according to a press release. The stake purchase values UMG at an enterprise value of about 35 billion euros ($41.55 billion).The blank check company said that after the stake buy, which is expected to close in 2021’s third quarter, it will continue to exist but will no longer be a SPAC. The entity will retain $2.9 billion to pursue a merger with a different company, the press release said.The SPAC board of directors’ financial advisor on the stake buy is Perella Weinberg Partners.Read more: Ackman’s SPAC signs deal to buy 10% of Vivendi’s Universal Bill Ackman's blank check company raises $4 bln in U.S. IPO Ackman reinvents SPAC in Universal Music deal talks",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.69,0.13,0.18,True,English,"['Ackman SPAC', 'UMG', 'Reuters', 'Universal Music Group', 'UMG', 'REUTERS', 'Sullivan & Cromwell', 'Freshfields', 'UMG', 'Cabinet', 'Vivendi', 'Reuters', 'Sullivan & Cromwell', 'Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer', 'Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton', 'Universal Music Group', 'UMG', 'Vivendi SE', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd', 'SPAC', 'Sullivan & Cromwell', 'Cadwalader', 'Wickersham & Taft', 'Cadwalader', 'Pershing Square Tontine', 'UMG', 'Freshfields', 'Cabinet Bompoint', 'Cleary', 'Vivendi', 'M&A', 'Vivendi', 'Mediaset SpA', 'Vivendi', 'Mediaset', 'UMG', 'Ackman SPAC', 'UMG', 'SPAC', 'Theentertainment company', 'Vivendi', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'UMG', 'SPAC', 'Perella Weinberg Partners', 'SPAC', 'Vivendi', 'Universal', 'SPAC', 'Universal Music']","['$4 bln UMG stake', 'Law firm', 'Ackman SPAC', 'headlines', 'Reuters', 'M&A partners Paul Shim', 'Italian commercial broadcaster Mediaset SpA', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd', '$4 billion initial public offering', 'U.S. IPO Ackman', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'five-year 3 billion euro financing', 'Universal Music deal talks', 'French firm Cabinet Bompoint', 'March firm press release', 'Universal Bill Ackman', 'Five law firms', 'capital markets partners', 'Perella Weinberg Partners', 'Universal Music Group', 'Billionaire investor Ackman', 'law firm names', 'blank check firm', 'French media company', 'blank check company', 'Cleary Gottlieb Steen', 'Summary Law firms', 'Gregory Patti Jr', 'The SPAC board', 'Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer', 'The Ackman SPAC', 'The Cleary attorneys', 'usual SPAC merger', 'Cleary rep Vivendi', 'The Cadwalader team', 'acquisition partners', '$4 billion deal', 'corporate partners', 'litigation partner', 'Theentertainment company', 'different company', 'Cleary counts', 'Arnd Wiegmann', 'Cadwalader guide', 'William Ackman-backed', 'record label', 'Taylor Swift', 'longtime advisor', 'Sebastian Fain', 'Dirk-Jan Smit', 'Pamela Marcogliese', 'United States', 'Jorge Juantorena', 'Adam Brenneman', 'Jared Gerber', 'longtime clients', 'legal actions', 'business deals', 'significant investors', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'late September', 'enterprise value', 'third quarter', 'financial advisor', 'stake purchase', 'stake buy', 'feedback tab', 'Stephen Fraidin', 'Vivendi SE', '35 billion', 'logo', 'UMG', 'building', 'Zurich', 'Switzerland', 'REUTERS', 'Sullivan', 'Cromwell', 'text', 'article', 'feature', 'beta', 'right', 'page', 'Hamilton', 'artists', 'Drake', 'companies', 'Sunday', 'Wickersham', 'Taft', 'guidance', 'advice', 'mergers', 'Netherlands', 'countries', 'seller', 'side', 'strategy', 'banks', 'strays', 'funds', 'list', 'entity', '2021']",2021-06-21,reuters.com

He also unveiled plans to launch a new investment vehicle and deploy up to $14 billion on future transactions.Ackman's SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, hopes to acquire the UMG shares from Vivendi, a French media conglomerate. Vivendi plans to list UMG on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange in the third quarter of this year, and PSTH shareholders would receive their UMG shares shortly afterward.""Universal Music Group is one of the greatest businesses in the world,"" Ackman said in a press release, adding his target was ""the world's leading music company, with a royalty on the growing demand for music.""The Pershing Square Capital Management chief also touted the deal as an ""iconic transaction."" He highlighted UMG's leading market share, stellar management, exposure to streaming music, minimal capital needs, and several other attributes that attracted him to the business.""Thank you for your patience Tontards!"" Ackman tweeted, referring to the retail investors on Reddit who have been closely following the SPAC deal and speculating on the identity of his target for months.PSTH will finance the deal with the $4 billion plus interest it garnered from its IPO last summer, and another $1.6 billion from Pershing Square funds and affiliates. It will use $4.1 billion of that sum to acquire Universal Music and cover its costs, leaving $1.5 billion to spare.Unusually, PSTH will remain a public company after the transaction, but will no longer be treated as a SPAC. Ackman's hedge fund and its affiliates have the right to buy another $1.4 billion of PSTH stock, meaning the vehicle could be armed with almost $3 billion to pursue another business combination.Separately, a Pershing Square affiliate has formed Pershing Square SPARC Holdings to sniff out another megadeal. The vehicle plans to distribute transferable rights to purchase its shares for $20 a pop to PSTH shareholders. Those rights can only be exercised after the SPARC (special-purpose acquisition rights company) reaches a definitive agreement with a target.If all of the rights are exercised, the SPARC would raise $5.6 billion. It also intends to tap Pershing Square affiliates for another $1 billion to $5 billion of investment.As a result, the SPARC would have between $6.6 billion and $10.6 billion to pursue a business combination. The vehicle's novel structure promises to avoid several of the disadvantages of a SPAC. It won't lock up capital, as investors can't exercise their rights or buy shares in the SPARC until a deal has been struck, and it doesn't have to close a deal within two years.Ackman's team will file a confidential registration statement for the SPARC with the SEC shortly.

Guns N’ Roses kept fans waiting 15 years for 2008’s “Chinese Democracy”, a patchy record at best. Billionaire Bill Ackman can expect a similarly flat reception to his blank-cheque firm announcing it is in talks to buy 10% of Universal Music for $4 billion.To be fair, Ackman seems to have secured a fair price for investors in his special purpose acquisition company, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH.N), some of whom call themselves Tontards on social media. The implied enterprise value of 35 billion euros ($42 billion) is 21 times the EBITDA that Bernstein analysts reckon Universal will generate this year, compared with rival Warner Music’s (WMG.O) 20 times. The world’s biggest label, home to Drake and Taylor Swift, probably merits the premium given its superior profitability and growth.But in other ways Ackman’s acolytes have a right to be disappointed. Universal was going public anyway. French parent Vivendi (VIV.PA), a media conglomerate controlled by Gallic tycoon Vincent Bolloré, is spinning off 60% to shareholders through an Amsterdam listing. Ackman is merely allowing them to get in slightly early at a price close to fair value. Compare that with other thwarted targets like financial-info empire Bloomberg, a competitor of Breakingviews parent Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), or $90 billion home-sharing app Airbnb (ABNB.O).Tontards could arguably get exposure to Universal at an even better price simply by buying shares in its parent. Vivendi’s businesses excluding its equity stake in the music label are worth almost 8 euros per share after deducting net debt and other liabilities, based on Breakingviews calculations using Bernstein valuations. That leaves 21 euros per share for its 80% Universal stake, implying an equity value for the whole thing of 29 billion euros. Instead, Ackman’s deal implies an equity value of 33 billion euros, 11% more. Investing through Vivendi rather than the SPAC would also allow Tontards to avoid fees.Another quirk is Ackman’s SPAC retaining $1.5 billion of capital for a future deal. While that leaves room for another new release, the vehicle’s shares fell by nearly 6% to $23.50 in after-market trading on Thursday, after reports of the Universal deal. It’s not exactly the rock ’n’ roll finale investors were hoping for.Follow liamwardproud on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- Bill Ackman’s special purpose acquisition company, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH), said on June 4 that it was in discussions with Vivendi to acquire 10% of Universal Music for about $4 billion.- The deal represents an enterprise value of 35 billion euros for Universal. Unlike most SPAC business combinations, PSTH and Universal will not combine into one company. Instead, Universal will complete its previously announced listing on Euronext Amsterdam in the third quarter. After that, PSTH will distribute Universal shares directly to PSTH shareholders.- Current PSTH shareholders will subsequently own three separately traded securities: ordinary shares in Universal valued at $14.75 a share before accounting for warrants; a security worth $5.25 a share representing the remaining PSTH resources; and so-called Special Purpose Acquisition Rights (SPARs), giving them the right to acquire common stock in Pershing Square’s so-called Special Purpose Acquisition Rights Company (SPARC) for $20 a share.- The latter can only be exercised after SPARC strikes a definitive agreement on a new deal. SPARC is expected to have $10.6 billion for a combination.- Pershing Square Tontine Holding’s shares were down nearly 6% at $23.50 in after-market trade on June 3, close to its initial public offering price of $20, after reports of the potential deal.SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href="""" target=""_blank""></a> | Editing by Ed Cropley and Oliver Taslic",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.3,0.16,0.54,True,English,"['Ackman SPAC', 'Universal', 'Reuters', 'Reuters', 'Guns N’ Roses', 'Universal Music', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holdings', 'PSTH', 'Universal', 'Warner Music', 'WMG', 'Universal', 'Vivendi', 'VIV.PA', 'Bloomberg', 'Breakingviews', 'Thomson Reuters', 'TRI', 'Airbnb', 'Tontards', 'Universal', 'Vivendi', 'Universal', 'Vivendi', 'SPAC', 'Tontards', 'SPAC', 'Universal', 'Twitter', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holdings', 'PSTH', 'Vivendi', 'Universal Music', 'Universal', 'PSTH', 'Universal', 'Universal', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'PSTH', 'Universal', 'PSTH', 'PSTH', 'Universal', 'PSTH', 'Pershing Square', 'SPARC', 'SPARC', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holding']","['Ackman SPAC', 'Universal denouement', 'Reuters', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Rights Company', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'Gallic tycoon Vincent Bolloré', 'three separately traded securities', 'Pershing Square Tontine Holdings', 'billion home-sharing app Airbnb', 'most SPAC business combinations', 'initial public offering price', 'financial-info empire Bloomberg', 'other thwarted targets', 'BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS', 'rival Warner Music', 'remaining PSTH resources', 'Billionaire Bill Ackman', 'Current PSTH shareholders', 'French parent Vivendi', 'one company', 'other ways', 'other liabilities', 'Reuters Breakingviews', 'Breakingviews parent', 'Breakingviews calculations', '35 billion euros', '29 billion euros', '33 billion euros', 'Guns N', 'Chinese Democracy', 'patchy record', 'flat reception', 'blank-cheque firm', 'fair price', 'social media', 'enterprise value', 'Bernstein analysts', 'biggest label', 'Taylor Swift', 'superior profitability', 'VIV.PA', 'media conglomerate', 'fair value', 'Thomson Reuters', 'equity stake', 'music label', 'net debt', 'Bernstein valuations', 'equity value', 'new release', 'market trading', 'CONTEXT NEWS', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'third quarter', 'common stock', 'definitive agreement', 'market trade', 'Ed Cropley', 'Oliver Taslic', 'future deal', 'new deal', 'potential deal', 'Amsterdam listing', 'ordinary shares', '80% Universal stake', 'Universal Music', 'Universal deal', 'Universal shares', '8 euros', '21 euros', 'LONDON', 'albums', 'Roses', 'fans', 'talks', 'investors', 'EBITDA', 'WMG', 'world', 'Drake', 'premium', 'growth', 'acolytes', 'competitor', 'ABNB', 'Tontards', 'exposure', 'businesses', 'thing', 'fees', 'quirk', 'capital', 'room', 'vehicle', 'Thursday', 'reports', 'rock', 'roll', 'finale', 'liamwardproud', 'Twitter', 'June', 'discussions', 'warrants', 'security', 'SPARs', 'SPARC', 'latter', 'BVsubscribe', 'Editing']",2021-06-04,reuters.com

After an intense acquisition period, Unifiedpost is now fully focused to maximise the value of its platform and the scale of its business network. While Unifiedpost has already announced FY 2021 to be a ‘construction year’, the fintech company is on track to deliver upon its future growth plans. The Group’s guidance for FY2021 is made explicit and its goals for FY 2022 and FY 2023 are reiterated.Performance highlightsin EUR million Q1 2021 Q1 2020 YoY growth Digital processing revenue1 24.2 16.9 +43.2% Organic 18.6 16.9 +10.1%(1) Acquisitions 5.6 - - Postal & parcel optimisation revenue2 15.6 - - Total statutory revenue 39.9 16.9 +136% (1) An additional 3.5% of organic growth of Q1 is delayed to later quarters because of COVID impact in Q1.Double digit growthUnifiedpost Q1 2021 digital processing revenue amounted to a new quarter high of €24.2 million, a 43.2% increase compared to Q1 2020. This is a combination of an organic growth of 10.1% and the digital processing revenue resulting from the acquisitions of 21 Grams, Akti and BanqUP. Revenue from Crossinx, Digithera and Efactura is not yet included.Management is delighted to report another quarter of double-digit growth in digital revenue, as Q1 2020 was impacted in only a limited way by the global pandemic while Q1 2021 is still affected by the (soft) lockdown of European economies, especially in Belgium, UK and Slovakia. Some projects and signed new contracts were postponed to Q2 2021.The recurring part of the revenue continues to be very high. In the first quarter, 95% of the company’s revenue was recurring.Continued expansion of customer baseStory continuesIn Q1 2021 Unifiedpost grew the number of SMEs to +480,000 in total (excluding the recent acquisitions). With the 5 acquisitions closed in Q1 the company added another 70.000 by the end of Q1. With the acquisition of Crossinx (early Q2) the customer base expanded further to +900,000 SME’s and +2,500 corporates.The number of Billtobox customers grew in Q1 with 28%. For JeFacture (France) near 1,000 accountants already subscribed (out of a total of 20,000). We see good onboarding of follow-through customers. The massive onboarding of SMEs is planned for the period September 2021 - December 2022 (majority at the end). This will be pushed by the French e-invoicing law which enters into force in September 2021.Entering a new phase of the acquisition strategyIn the first quarter of 2021, five strategic acquisitions were closed: Akti, BanqUP, 21 Grams, Digithera and Efactura. The Crossinx acquisition was closed on the 9th of April (Crossinx). All acquisitions add value for Unifiedpost in terms of full functional coverage from small businesses to large corporates and extended functionality. Moreover, the Group also expanded its presence to a total of 26 countries today.Construction yearAligned to the earlier mapped-out strategy, management’s focus will now shift more towards the integration of these acquired businesses and the realization of the budgeted synergies. During this construction year, all acquired companies and products will now be integrated into our full platform solution for SMEs and corporates.The roll-out of the full SME platform is essential to uplift the growth of Unifiedpost in 2022 and to achieve the future profitability guidance it has given. The roll-out is done on a country-by-country approach in two major waves. The roll-out for each country consist of the following steps: (i) have local SME team operational (23/26 countries ready), (ii) have a local cloud running (15/26 ready), (iii) integrate local functionality and services in the platform (10/26 ready), and (iv) deliver full payment possibilities, including PSD2 connectivity and IBAN accounts (2/26 ready). 2 of the 26 countries have been fully launched (Belgium and France). Other countries will follow in two waves: one wave before summer (+11 countries) and one at year end (+13 countries). Wave 1 is 83% complete, wave 2 is currently 52% complete.OutlookAfter a strong first quarter and an intense acquisition trajectory, Unifiedpost’s organic revenue growth is expecting to accelerate over the next three quarters. Unifiedpost expects an organic revenue growth forecast for the full year of at least 15%.For 2022 and 2023 Unifiedpost confirms the guidance it has given on 12 April 2021 (with an accelerated growth target for 2023).The guidance on growth:The management expects organic growth of 25% of its digital processing revenue for 2022; andAn organic growth of 30% of its digital processing revenue as from 2023.On profitability management confirms its guidance:The management targets a gross margin of +60% by 2023 for its digital processing revenue.Adjusted EBITDA3 margin is expected to exceed 25% by 2023.About UnifiedpostUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on ""Documents"", ""Identity"" and ""Payments"".

Customers can use their mobile device to transfer money from their payment account to another individual's account across Europe without manually exchanging payment information, such as IBAN.This service supports the interoperability between the different existing domestic mobile payment schemes and provides the option to retrieve the necessary payment details like IBAN and beneficiary name, by using well-known aliases like a mobile phone number. Besides the pure P2P payments functionality, this SPL scheme and service could also be complementary to a request to pay (RTP) functionality or to other payment use cases or schemes.Extended functionalitySince its launch the SPL scheme has received several new functionalities like the new alias type ‘e-mail address’. Furthermore, it offers now the possibility to check if an alias exists in the current proxy network. This feature plays an important role during the onboarding process for new customers to show which of their existing personal contacts are also participating in the same payment network.Both extensions will improve the user experience and will extend the customer reach of the existing domestic or closed-loop P2P schemes. In addition to basic P2P payments, it can also be used for more advanced features like Person-to-Professional (P2Pro) payments and bill splitting functionalities that are provided by the mobile payment applications.European payment initiativesThe SPL service became a central component for the success of any P2P payments which are the backbone for the usage of every new payment scheme. So it is not surprising that all new European initiatives refer to the proxy lookup as one of their potential components.For P2P and P2Pro payments the SPL service can be used to retrieve the necessary payment details and in the case of RTP it may be used to identify the consumer (payer) and his/her IBAN as the recipient of the generated payment request.Michael Steinbach, CEO equensWorldline SE, emphasises the importance of such a proxy service for the European payment landscape. “With the usage of such a central proxy lookup service, the user experience and security of person-to-person payments significantly improves. Furthermore, it will strongly support the usage of request-to-pay messages to improve the conversion rate for beneficiaries.”According to Etienne Goosse, Director General of the EPC, harmonisation, competition and innovation in Europe are key to develop a dynamic pan-European payment ecosystem. “The EPC has established the SPL scheme to facilitate European cross-border P2P payments. In this process, equensWorldline has been a reliable and innovative partner during the service implementation and participated actively in the continuous improvement of the service.”",neutral,0.0,0.87,0.13,mixed,0.57,0.19,0.24,True,English,"['EPC', 'equensWorldline', 'equensWorldline', 'equensWorldline SE', 'Worldline', 'Euronext', 'WLN', 'European Payment Council', 'EPC', 'IBAN', 'equensWorldline SE', 'EPC', 'EPC', 'equensWorldline']","['Sepa Proxy Lookup Service', 'EPC', 'equensWorldline', 'contract', 'different existing domestic mobile payment schemes', 'other payment use cases', 'dynamic pan-European payment ecosystem', 'existing European mobile Person-to-Person', 'SEPA Proxy Lookup (SPL', 'European cross-border P2P payments', 'pure P2P payments functionality', 'central proxy lookup service', 'existing personal contacts', 'mobile phone number', 'mobile payment applications', 'European Payment Council', 'necessary payment details', 'current proxy network', 'same payment network', 'European payment landscape', 'closed-loop P2P schemes', 'transactional services industry', 'European payment initiatives', 'basic P2P payments', 'several new functionalities', 'new alias type', 'new payment scheme', 'central SPL service', 'CEO equensWorldline SE', 'Person money transfers', 'mobile device', 'payment services', 'European initiatives', 'European leader', 'payment information', 'central component', 'proxy service', 'P2Pro) payments', 'P2Pro payments', 'payment request', 'SPL scheme', 'Extended functionality', 'person payments', 'user experience', 'beneficiary name', 'important role', 'customer reach', 'advanced features', 'potential components', 'Michael Steinbach', 'conversion rate', 'Etienne Goosse', 'Director General', 'innovative partner', 'service implementation', 'continuous improvement', 'new customers', 'onboarding process', 'The EPC', 'Source', 'subsidiary', 'WLN', 'partnership', 'interoperability', 'account', 'individual', 'IBAN', 'option', 'known', 'aliases', 'RTP', 'launch', 'possibility', 'extensions', 'addition', 'Professional', 'bill', 'success', 'backbone', 'usage', 'consumer', 'payer', 'recipient', 'importance', 'security', 'messages', 'beneficiaries', 'harmonisation', 'competition', 'innovation', 'reliable']",2021-06-24,finextra.com

The innovating technology they created is unique in its market, capable to generate custom fit-to-size packaging for every e-commerce order, making shipments more efficient, significantly reducing the use of cardboard and plastic filling material and contributing to reducing the carbon footprint of e-commerce deliveries. We look forward to working together with the management team in the coming months on how we can best transform the organization into an independently operating company – corporate carve-outs being one of the focus areas of Standard Investment.”The Drachten production site, which has about 240 employees, hosts sales, marketing, service, R&D and production teams for APS as well as for Document System (DS) mid-range folders/inserters, which Quadient will continue to market.
