“Sustainable funds perform a little less badly, but the net impact is still bad,” it said.
The problem, according to Util’s data, is that sustainable funds do not have much positive impact on an absolute basis.

ESG funds on average have net negative impacts on five environmental goals, including clean water and sanitation, as well as protecting life on land and in the water.","Environmental, social and governance funds do little to drive change, largely because they rely on ESG rankings and other data that set the bar for good corporate citizenship “abysmally low”, research suggests.

Most sustainability funds, and the data underpinning them, focus on relative performance of metrics based on self-reported data, rather than on the absolute impact of their business activities on social or environmental goals, according to a report published last week from Util, a London-based fintech, that crunches publicly disclosed data to measure impact on sustainability goals.

As a result, sustainable funds look like and impact the world much like “vanilla funds”, the report noted. “Sustainable funds perform a little less badly, but the net impact is still bad,” it said.

The report is one of a string of recent studies to claim that ESG product providers focus more on looking the part than on effecting meaningful change.

This article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.

However, some managers of ESG or sustainable funds argue that it is difficult to translate data and strategies into tangible outcomes that investors can appreciate.

“Our profession doesn’t do a very good job of working through ambiguity,” said Ethan Powell, chief executive of Impact Shares, which teams up with organisations including the NAACP and YWCA to offer social-outcome-oriented ETFs.

A lot of managers are not “intellectually honest with themselves” about the impact that they are capable of delivering, he added. Instead of dismissing ESG investing outright, asset managers and investors should assess the appropriate level of social and environmental impact for each dollar invested “and have a conversation about how they want their capital to influence the trajectory of the world around them,” he said.

The problem, according to Util’s data, is that sustainable funds do not have much positive impact on an absolute basis.

The average sustainable fund scored 3 on a scale of negative 100 to 100 on performance against the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were established in 2015.

The goals include targets for climate action, responsible consumption, gender equality and ending hunger and poverty.

Non-sustainable funds, meanwhile, received an average score of 1 out of 100.

However, the relative strength is nothing for ESG funds to ride high on, Util wrote. ESG funds on average have net negative impacts on five environmental goals, including clean water and sanitation, as well as protecting life on land and in the water.

“No matter your strategy, it’s likely your capital is contributing to environmental degradation,” the report said.

An increase in impact-focused data — which Util seeks to provide — can help managers better assess the impact that their investments have on the environment, the organisation claimed.

Other data advances may also make it easier for companies to address impacts that are material to their business, said Jennifer Grancio, chief executive of Engine No. 1, an activist hedge fund and ETF sponsor.

“If you go back 10 years, the data was very patchy,” she said last week during her keynote address at the Morningstar Investment Conference. However, more recently, “there’s been huge progress”, she added.

Though ESG ratings may be “simplistic”, her company uses the raw data from providers as part of its core financial analysis of companies.

But looking at data alone does not indicate that a fund is impactful, said Impact Shares’ Powell. “Intent matters,” he said.

Engine No. 1, for example, focuses on the long-term changes that will make a difference, even if it means a short-term financial impact, Grancio said.

The investment industry had let itself “be reduced down to the quarterly income statement analysis” as the primary way of assessing risk and reward, she said.

“The impacts for different companies do have a material impact over time,” she added. “Continually making the case for long-term benefits can effect change.”

Consider the numbers. Industry group Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates that global investment in sustainable assets rose to $35.3tn in 2020 from $22.8tn in 2016. That is an astonishing 35.9% of total global assets under management.

Such funds pursue strategies ranging from integrating ESG factors into financial analysis to corporate engagement, with exclusionary or positive screening in between. Yet whether they will deliver on the ESG promise is another matter.

Fund management groups have commercial imperatives as well as fiduciary obligations. That can cause them to overstate their sustainability credentials – a practice known as greenwashing.

Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainable investment at BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund management group, has publicly denounced these funds as a marketing gimmick, noting that ESG products carry higher fees than non-ESG funds. He now believes that his efforts at BlackRock led the world into a dangerous mirage and that claims that ESG investing will deliver higher returns are dubious.

At the same time the whole area is beset by methodological and data problems. The International Organization of Securities Commissions recently complained that ESG rating and data providers are largely unregulated, lack transparency about their methods, offer uneven coverage and harbour potential conflicts of interest.

And at the OMFIF Sustainable Policy Institute symposium, ‘Revolutionising finance for net zero’, Ignazio Visco, governor of the Banca d’Italia, pointed out that there are neither widely accepted rules for ESG data disclosure by individual firms nor agreed auditing standards to verify the reported data. He pointed to intrinsic difficulties in deciding which indicators are relevant in assigning an ESG score, especially when compared to financial aggregates. He also highlighted estimates suggesting that 55% of funds labelled ‘low carbon’, ‘fossil-fuel free’ and ‘green energy’ have exaggerated their claims.

At company level there is extraordinary fragmentation in reporting standards on ESG issues. While there are initiatives to move towards a more coherent international framework – notably the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board – progress is painfully slow.

This matters because the enforced obsolescence of the global carbon-intensive capital stock that will be required to meet the emissions targets of the Paris agreement – and potentially the COP26 summit in November – will inflict huge damage on many corporate balance sheets and revenue accounts.

A Harvard Business School study has looked at the potential costs of bringing environmental externalities back into company accounts. Its Impact-Weighted Accounts Project found that of 1,694 companies covered, 15% would lose all profitability if external impact costs were included, while 32% would see profitability reduced by 25% or more.

Most companies do not report such information about the cost of shifting their business models onto a more sustainable basis. Few have made explicit commitments to net-zero emissions. A survey of 400 directors by consultant Ernst & Young found that more than half of directors surveyed said they were considering ESG issues only because compliance, disclosure obligations and shareholder pressure compelled them to do so. Small wonder few believe decarbonisation is efficiently priced in global markets.

In fact, there is evidence that the difficulty of securing the transition to a low-carbon economy may perversely be increased by ESG funds. Researchers at Edhec, a French business school, have found that passive exchange-traded funds tracking low carbon, climate change or Paris-aligned indices allocate little of their money to the greenest companies and habitually increase the weighting of companies with a deteriorating environmental performance. They also found that these ETFs were starving sectors that needed to make the biggest investment in decarbonisation.

Fund managers struggling in the ESG data fog place heavy reliance on ESG ratings providers. Yet the ratings are based on widely different methodologies which are, in the end, subjective. This results in weird outcomes. For example, rating firm MSCI currently assigns ExxonMobil a BBB rating (high average) while drug-maker Moderna has a BB rating (between average and high average). So a notorious climate change denier is rated higher than a global leader in providing vaccines for Covid-19.

In that well-worn but apt cliché, few ESG funds really do what they say on the tin. But they have been a fantastic business opportunity for the big fund management groups.

Clearly investors in ESG funds need to bring a more sceptical eye to the contents of ESG portfolios and to the voting records of their fund managers. Investment advisers and journalists should likewise bring a critical intelligence to bear on the sector. As the quality of companies’ reporting on the sustainability of their business models improves over time, this will become easier.

But the underlying assumption that institutional investors can play a key role in securing the transition to a low-carbon economy is highly questionable. Without a firm push by governments for more widespread adoption of carbon pricing, the greening of the global corporate sector will remain elusive.

Just the other day I was thinking there aren’t enough acronyms in the world. Luckily, another one is quickly gaining prominence in the lexicon: ESG.

Many readers probably know what it stands for — Environmental, Social and Governance — but I suspect few understand exactly what it can mean for your organization, or how to successfully integrate it within your on-going strategy and culture.

Don’t be alarmed. This column hopes to help you navigate this emerging landscape.

Yet even the people involved in the “business” of ESG struggle to define it. As with any new benchmark, no standards exist. The myriad rating agencies that “score” a company’s ESG rating are basically making it up as they go along. That will change in time, but for now, for most companies it comes down to a judgement call.

The goal is not to generate an ESG rating for public relations purposes. Rather, it is to develop a plan to integrate it within your overall organization not only to improve your business, but the world around you.

Unless you’re a public company, you can ignore the ratings agency chaos. And the reality is that you should never run your company based on other’s interpretation of what you as a business owner should be doing. What’s right for you with respect to ESG is totally dependent upon the unique characteristics of your business and culture.

I think there is general consensus as to what ESG encompasses, so let’s start there.

Environmental

With the growing focus on climate change, this is arguably the most prominent of the ESG components. It can encompass myriad aspects of a company’s environmental impact. For most companies, it would include energy use, carbon footprint and resource utilization. But for others, very specific environmental criteria might become priorities. For a pharmaceutical company, the treatment of animals would be a critical factor. For agriculture, a major issue would be water usage.

Social

The social component doesn’t only pertain to how you treat your employees but all your company’s stakeholders. The challenge here is the breath of the stakeholder population. A narrow definition of a stakeholder includes employees, shareholders, the community, creditors, investors, customers and owners. However, under the broadest definition, it would be virtually everyone potentially affected by your business — suppliers, competitors, prospective employees, customers and even future generations.

Governance

Governance issues are greatly dependent upon whether your company is public or private. With public companies, stockholders are a focal point as is the composition of the board of directors. For private firms, transparency in accounting, risk management, and data privacy come into play.

These lists represent only a subset of possible variables related to ESG.

QDIAs can be target-date retirement funds, which automatically reset their asset mix to become less risky as the specified target retirement year nears.
Conflicting Views on ESG Funds In Wall Street Journal opposing opinion columns last month, two economics professors at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Ill., squared off over the appropriateness of ESG funds in retirement plans.
Aaron Yoon, an assistant professor of accounting and information management, wrote that ""Offering employees the option of investing in [ESG] funds in their 401(k) retirement-savings plans is essential.
""Even those who are willing to pay extra to support sustainability and a 'green' agenda cannot be sure that ESG funds deliver on that either.""","Page Content

This article has been updated.

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed removing barriers put in place by the prior administration that would have limited plan fiduciaries' ability to consider climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as risk factors affecting workers' financial security when fiduciaries select retirement plan investments and exercise shareholder proxy voting rights.

Some analysts are questioning whether the proposal, as currently worded, could require fiduciaries to consider the economic effects of climate change and other ESG factors when evaluating funds for retirement plans.



The proposed rule, Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights, would apply to investments included in 401(k) and other defined contribution plans, as well as to defined benefit pension plans. The proposal, published in the Federal Register on Oct. 14, follows an executive order signed in May by President Joe Biden directing the federal government to treat climate change as a threat to workers' retirement savings.

In 2020, the administration of former President Donald Trump had issued a final rule, subsequently blocked by the Biden administration, that would have required sponsors of investment-based employee plans to strictly apply the fiduciary duties of prudence under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) when considering plan investments that promote nonfinancial objectives, such as reducing carbon emissions. A separate Trump administration final rule would have barred retirement plan fiduciaries from casting corporate-shareholder proxy votes in favor of social or political positions that don't advance the financial interests of retirement plan participants.



Duties of Prudence and Loyalty



Under the Biden administration, the DOL takes the position that ESG factors, and climate change issues in particular, pose financial risks that plan sponsors should consider as prudent fiduciaries.

According to a DOL fact sheet, the proposed rule ""retains the core principle that the duties of prudence and loyalty require ERISA plan fiduciaries to focus on material risk-return factors and not subordinate the interests of participants and beneficiaries (such as by sacrificing investment returns or taking on additional investment risk) to objectives unrelated to the provision of benefits under the plan,"" a position similar to the prior guidance.



The proposed rule, however, also ""addresses the [DOL's] concern that the 2020 [Trump administration] rules have created uncertainty and are having the undesirable effect of discouraging ERISA fiduciaries' consideration of climate change and other ESG factors in investment decisions, even in cases when it is in the financial interest of plans to take such considerations into account.""

Acting Assistant Secretary for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Ali Khawar said the new proposal ""will bolster the resilience of workers' retirement savings and pensions by removing the artificial impediments—and chilling effect on environmental, social and governance investments—caused by the prior administration's rules.""

He added, ""A principal idea underlying the proposal is that climate change and other ESG factors can be financially material, and, when they are, considering them will inevitably lead to better long-term risk-adjusted returns, protecting the retirement savings of America's workers.""



A 'Significant Change'



According to R. Sterling Perkinson, a partner in the Raleigh, N.C., office of law firm Kilpatrick Townsend, the proposed regulations ""represent a significant change in the DOL's viewpoint of fiduciary duties that relate to ESG factors and shareholder activism, but they do not fundamentally alter the fiduciary duties to make investment decisions and to vote proxies and exercise shareholder rights to enhance investment returns. They may nevertheless have an impact by removing potential barriers from selecting funds that, for example, take into account climate change impacts or corporate governance practices as part of their investment strategies.""



Looking ahead, Perkinson noted, ""It remains to be seen whether the DOL will go a step further in final regulations by mandating consideration of certain ESG factors, or whether they will maintain a more neutral position that they are no different than other traditional investment criteria.""



Along those lines, retirement plan consultancy October Three highlighted the section of the proposal stating that a fiduciary, when evaluating a plan investment, must generally give appropriate consideration to:

""The projected return of the portfolio relative to the funding objectives of the plan, which may often require an evaluation of the economic effects of climate change and other environmental, social, or governance factors on the particular investment or investment course of action. [Emphasis added.]""





The firm advised that ""the italicized language, added by this new proposal, can be read not just to authorize consideration of ESG factors but to require it 'often.' ""



William D. Jewett, a partner at law firm Verrill Dana in Boston, recommended that ""fiduciaries should proceed with caution until the DOL's back-and-forth on ESG has settled into a durable set of rules. The partisan reactions to the proposed regulation that have appeared to date suggest that the back-and-forth is far from over.""



ESG Default Investments

The proposed rule reverses the prior rule's prohibition on using ESG funds as qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs), which are types of mutual funds that plan sponsors can select as the default option in automatic enrollment 401(k)-type defined contribution plans.

QDIAs can be target-date retirement funds, which automatically reset their asset mix to become less risky as the specified target retirement year nears. Mutual fund companies have begun marketing target-date funds made up of investments that meet their ESG criteria.

""This will be a huge win, if the final rule ends up looking like the proposal, for some asset managers who rolled out ESG target-date funds over the past few years,"" Jason Roberts, CEO of the Pension Resource Institute consultancy in San Diego, told RIABiz, an online publication for investment advisors.

The comment period for the proposed rule will run through Dec. 13, 2021. Comments can be submitted at https://www.regulations.gov/.

Conflicting Views on ESG Funds In Wall Street Journal opposing opinion columns last month, two economics professors at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Ill., squared off over the appropriateness of ESG funds in retirement plans. Aaron Yoon, an assistant professor of accounting and information management, wrote that ""Offering employees the option of investing in [ESG] funds in their 401(k) retirement-savings plans is essential. If individuals are making clear that they want the option to invest this way, there is no good reason to deny them the opportunity to do so in their 401(k) accounts."" He wrote that research he conducted with colleagues showed companies with good ESG ratings relevant to the sector in which the company operates delivered superior stock returns. In a counter-argument, Phillip Braun, a clinical professor of finance and associate chairman of the finance department at the Kellogg School of Management, wrote that ESG funds ""tend to be more expensive than other funds""—and that according to a Morningstar study, the asset-weighted average expense ratio of U.S. ESG funds was 0.61 percent in 2020, compared with 0.41 percent for all U.S. open-end mutual funds and 0.11 percent for traditional index funds. He noted that higher fund fees are correlated over time with lower returns on dollars invested, compared to similar funds with lower fees.

""Determining whether a stock or a fund is truly advancing ESG goals is difficult because the investment industry lacks a comprehensive ESG measurement framework,"" Braun added. ""Even those who are willing to pay extra to support sustainability and a 'green' agenda cannot be sure that ESG funds deliver on that either.""

Brooke's Note: There is no way to do business with a person or entity without trusting them. In fact, the more you trust your business partner, the deeper and more effective the business relationship can be. Constant verification is a giant cause of friction. It's time-consuming and is itself a cause of distrust. As the investment industry continues to rapidly advance, the business models that presume high levels of trust like RIAs or ERISA-ruled pensions are going to win out. But now we are asking fiduciaries to raise their game, again, so that we can take on four- or five-level chess after years where one or two seemed sufficient. But we can't begin to put this onus onto them without trusting them. This DOL green light to permit ESG as a key factor in investing for plan sponsors takes a step into that direction.

Federal regulators today announced a proposed rule that takes ESG from being a plan sponsor caveat emptor to one that can be used with impunity as a tie-breaker with pecuniary factors.

Jason Roberts: This will be a huge win, if the final rule ends up looking like the proposal, for a some asset managers who rolled out ESG target date funds



The Department of Labor (DOL), which oversees trillions of dollars in pension assets, took the chill out of an 11th-our rule the Trump administration imposed days before the Nov. 2020 presidential election.

The rule put plan sponsors using environmental, social and governance factors to decide portfolio composition on ice skates for a potential audit or lawsuit.

""While the prior rule was only in “effect” for a few months, we did see a chilling effect on plan sponsors’ willingness to consider ESG factors,"" says Jason Roberts, CEO of Pension Resources in San Diego.

""Advisors were also reluctant to introduce such factors into their analysis.

The DOL's move to eliminate ESG factors took a vital tool away from asset managers, Aron Szapiro, director of policy reseach at Morningstar writes. He was formerly a senior analyst at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), specializing in retirement security issues and pension plan policy.

""We have argued for some time that the Labor Department should not have raised barriers for plan sponsors that wish to use ESG analysis to select investments,"" he said. ""In fact, ESG considerations can be financially material, and many asset managers integrate them into their analysis.

""Today, the DOL unveiled its proposal. Comments are due within 60 days, so I anticipate a final rule will be published in early 2022 with an effective date in Q2 or early Q3,"" Roberts says.

Huge win

The key line written in the new DOL rule is: If after considering relevant factors, a fiduciary concludes that “competing investments … equally serve the financial interests of the plan … the fiduciary is not prohibited from selecting the investment … based on collateral benefits other than investment returns.”

It's a double-edged sword that plan sponsors can live with, Roberts says.

""Translation: Fiduciaries can use ESG factors to break a tie – even if the factor is not directly tied to performance; they may not, however, accept expected reduced returns or greater risks to secure such,"" Roberts says.

Less known but no less cheered in the industry was DOL's reversal of the Trump rule's prohibition on using ESG factors in Qualified Default Investment Alternatives, also known as QDIAs. It's the product or portfolio that an employee uses to contribute to their plan when they punt on making a selection.

""Most people access retirement investments through these defaults when they are available, so undoing this rule is key to mainstreaming ESG,"" Szapiro says.

The importance of QDIAs is that they become a “safe harbor,” hence the employer is absolved of liability should the QDIA absorb investment losses.

""This will be a huge win, if the final rule ends up looking like the proposal, for a some asset managers who rolled out ESG target date funds over the past few years,"" Roberts says.

BlackRock and Natixis top the list of fund firms with products in this ESG target-date category.

Zeroing risk

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink published a very ESG-centric guest essay in The New York Times, today, simultaneous with DOL's ESG announcement.

The Fink letter begs for a way to use finance to reduce climate change risk in developing countries that lack capital investment. He suggests using government grants and subsidies to supplement institutional investors, like pension funds and insurance companies.

The goal would be to absorb risks characteristic of emerging economies--political instability, credit risk and the enforceability of contracts.

""An essential part of raising the scale of capital necessary to transition emerging market economies to net zero will be using public finance to raise more private capital.""

Essentially, governments would serve as co-signers on private loans made to buy clean infrastructure.

It is based on the fact that emerging markets -- particularly India and Brazil -- will need at least $1 trillion per year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 – more than six times current investment.

Private funding for emerging market climate finance is constrained by a high level of country risk -- a problem because they are currently ""undiversifiable risks.""

""Government funding in the form of grants and subsidies can absorb some of the risks that come with investing in emerging economies. They can make climate projects a viable option for institutional investors,"" he writes.

New game

The Trump rule was proposed in June, 2020, and finalized on Oct 30, four days before Trump went down in defeat at the polls. It officially took effect Jan.12, this year. See: A big wince as Trump's DOL presses efforts to erase Obama-era ESG guidance, with tough new rule to curb do-good funds in ERISA accounts; critics cry 'politics'

It required fiduciaries for private pension plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to avoid investing in ESG products that sacrifice investment returns or take on additional risk to meet ESG goals.

Specifically, it directed ERISA plan fiduciaries to “select investments and investment courses of action based solely on financial considerations relevant to the risk-adjusted economic value of a particular investment or investment course of action.”",neutral,0.03,0.84,0.13,mixed,0.22,0.12,0.66,True,English,"['DOL', 'BlackRock', 'Natixis', 'Labor Dept.', 'ERISA', 'DOL', 'Vanguard', 'BlackRock', 'State Street', 'ESG', 'Department of Labor', 'DOL', 'administration', 'Pension Resources', 'DOL', 'Morningstar', 'U.S. Government Accountability Office', 'GAO', 'Labor Department', 'ESG', 'DOL', 'DOL', 'DOL', 'BlackRock', 'Natixis', 'BlackRock', 'The New York Times', 'DOL']",2021-10-14,riabiz.com,"['Trump-era 401(k) ESG investing chill', 'Big effect', 'ESGs TDFs', 'default option', 'DOL', 'undoing', 'BlackRock', 'Natixis', 'products', 'Trump-era 401(k) ESG investing chill', 'Big effect', 'ESGs TDFs', 'default option', 'DOL', 'undoing', 'BlackRock', 'Natixis', 'products', 'Trump-era 401(k) ESG investing chill', 'Big effect', 'ESGs TDFs', 'default option', 'DOL', 'undoing', 'BlackRock', 'Natixis', 'products', 'U.S. Government Accountability Office', 'plan sponsor caveat emptor', 'Qualified Default Investment Alternatives', 'The New York Times', 'ESG target date funds', 'BlackRock CEO Larry Fink', 'The Fink letter', 'Nov. 2020 presidential election', 'ESG-centric guest essay', 'retirement security issues', 'climate change risk', 'ESG target-date category', 'The Labor Dept.', 'DOL green light', 'many asset managers', 'plan sponsors’ willingness', 'pension plan policy', 'new DOL rule', 'pension funds', 'government grants', 'effective date', 'The Department', 'The DOL', 'policy reseach', 'Zeroing risk', 'Pension Resources', 'retirement investments', 'investment returns', 'investment losses', 'capital investment', 'ESG powers', 'ESG mandates', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG announcement', 'ESG factors', 'legit considerations', 'Constant verification', 'high levels', 'ERISA-ruled pensions', 'five-level chess', 'State Street', 'growing threat', 'shareholder democracy', 'Federal regulators', 'huge win', 'Trump administration', 'ice skates', 'potential audit', 'San Diego', 'vital tool', 'senior analyst', 'Labor Department', 'key line', 'financial interests', 'collateral benefits', 'double-edged sword', 'reduced returns', 'greater risks', 'Most people', 'safe harbor', 'fund firms', 'developing countries', 'institutional investors', 'pecuniary factors', 'governance factors', 'relevant factors', 'business partner', 'business relationship', 'business models', 'pension assets', 'final rule', 'prior rule', 'Trump rule', 'key factor', 'competing investments', 'investment industry', 'Brooke Southall', 'giant cause', 'environmental, social', 'portfolio composition', 'chilling effect', 'Aron Szapiro', 'early Q', 'ESG analysis', 'Jason Roberts', 'fiduciaries', 'October', 'Note', 'way', 'person', 'entity', 'friction', 'distrust', 'RIAs', 'game', 'years', 'one', 'onus', 'investing', 'step', 'direction', 'good', 'problems', 'Vanguard', 'critics', 'Comment', 'impunity', 'tie-breaker', 'proposal', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'lawsuit', 'months', 'Advisors', 'move', 'director', 'Morningstar', 'GAO', 'barriers', '60 days', 'Q2', 'fiduciary', 'Translation', 'performance', 'reversal', 'prohibition', 'QDIAs', 'product', 'employee', 'selection', 'defaults', 'importance', 'employer', 'liability', 'past', 'Natixis', 'list', 'finance', 'subsidies']"

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page.

October 20, 2021 - The millennial generation is undeniably shaping and influencing investment decisions across the economy. Millennials are demanding a heightened focus on equity, racial justice and the environment. With this trend, the focus on valuation of social, environmental and governance (ESG) impacts is increasingly taking center stage while rapidly evolving in the process. Key institutional investors have embraced this trend as good business sense by making sustainability their new standard for investment.

According to Blackrock, part of a company's commitment to long-term sustainable growth involves better data and disclosures to help investors understand ""the deep interdependence between environmental and social issues,"" especially given that ""climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on low-income communities around the world.""

Heeding the call, corporate directors are actively looking beyond short-term profit and loss and demanding to see that their companies are effectively grappling with the realities of social change, the challenges of operational environmental impacts, and opportunities to engage with community stakeholders. This leads to hard questions at shareholder meetings and the push for more information and data in these areas.

While directors may be driven in some instances by personal commitments to the global corporate good, their actions are also rooted in business judgment, as market demands for corporate social accountability are changing the expectations of corporate fiduciary duty. Indeed, ample evidence reveals that poor environmental performance and undesirable corporate impacts may negatively impact operations, limit access to capital, and cause adverse reputational effects.

The Biden administration's ""whole of government"" (https://bit.ly/3lToITK) focus on environmental justice, and particularly its Justice40 movement, which strives to drive 40 percent of federal financial investments to vulnerable communities and communities of color, leverages this evolving ESG movement.

In fact, the government is looking at these ""environmental justice"" or ""EJ"" communities in every aspect of its decision-making across industries and sectors, particularly in connection with climate change and emissions impacts, which are a critical focus of voluntary ESG reporting. As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) works to craft a potential new rule aimed at standardizing ESG reporting among registered companies, climate risk and impacts will likely be a focus.

The increased public, federal, and corporate focus around social, economic and environmental equity presents an incredible opportunity to corporate leaders that lean into this moment. Not only the public, but companies and their shareholders are craving more standardization and improved reporting and disclosure for environmental and social impacts, including around community engagement and commitments. Companies not only have a chance to develop and refine their own disclosures, but also to shape the very rules that will be applied.

Under the evolving principles of ESG, companies are continuously refining approaches to corporate disclosures in the areas of energy use, human rights protection and environmental stewardship. Increasingly, corporate websites, shareholder reports and reports to regulatory bodies are including more than just a passing reference to company performance in the environmental and human capital space. These disclosures now often include data and details such as graphs on air emissions, including greenhouse gas calculations, and energy use trends; inventories of environmental releases; results of employee quality of life surveys; summaries of charitable and educational investments, and even case studies on partnerships and collaborations with neighboring fenceline communities.

There is certainly a business case for ESG and EJ, as investors are now viewing the impacts of climate change as the existential crisis of our time. Over time, it is certainly possible that access to public and private capital may be prioritized for companies that help mitigate environmental stressors rather than exacerbate them. The SEC has emphasized that ESG risks, such as those related to diversity, are important predictors for organizational resilience and maximizing risk-adjusted returns on investments.

In many ways, the crux of ESG involves identifying risks and opportunities that are not readily apparent in the traditional corporate financial disclosures. Evolving ESG expectations reflect the notion that anything perceived by the market as materially affecting a company's long-term value should be measured, managed and reported on — including non-financial, social and environmental information.

Companies at the leading edge of both ESG and the public focus on equity are holding related discussions not just in the Boardroom or C-Suite but are engaging employees at all levels of the company and seeking to understand and evaluate direct or indirect impacts, whether local, national, or global. Internally, employees are assessing sustainability, developing measurable goals, and helping to integrate ESG and other equity considerations, such as environmental justice, in both corporate values and individual performance evaluations — even executive performance bonuses are being tied to performance against social and environmental values.

At this point, however, there are few metrics or rules for companies to directly quantify, for comparison, traditionally subjective impacts. In fact, public reports indicate that board and corporate executives are desperate for more guidance on ""how to do"" consistent ESG disclosures, and they are troubled by the current variability across industry sectors. Many companies just include these burgeoning ESG metrics in their financial reporting while others are releasing standalone ESG reports.

Two of the most widely used ESG voluntary disclosure frameworks, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) take different approaches to ""quantifying"" impacts for the marketplace.

Many of the SASB industry sector frameworks require specific disclosure of the number of facilities located in or near dense areas of population. GRI, on the hand, requires reporting on topics that are ""material."" It is up to the company to decide what is ""material,"" but these include reporting on local community engagement, monitoring, grievance processes, vulnerable groups, and health and safety impacts of products and services.

The wait for a required ESG disclosure framework may not be too far off, as SEC's proposed rule on climate disclosures is expected soon. As a precursor to a potential rule, the SEC launched a new Climate and ESG Task Force earlier this year and appointed its first policy advisory for climate and ESG. Although climate change is the current focus of the SEC, the Biden administration has closely linked climate impacts to environmental justice. The SEC could soon propose new rules regarding disclosures about other ESG concepts, such as environmental justice, racial equity in human capital, and political contributions.

As the SEC explores how to place parameters around ESG reporting, companies should consider how best to describe their organization's strategy around climate and environmental justice, racial and economic equity, and human rights, as well as stewardship of land, natural resources and local economies. Even more challenging will be any consideration (required or voluntary) of cumulative environmental or social impacts, actions taken to address environmental, climate and social inequity, and the results of those actions.

Another federal agency in the environmental disclosure game is the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which issued the Green Guides to prevent companies from making environmental claims that mislead consumers. The guides include general principles that apply to all environmental marketing claims and have historically been used to protect consumers from products with misleading environmental claims — like ""made with renewable energy"" or ""fully biodegradable.""

Citizen groups, however, are pushing the FTC to expand the application of the Green Guides to marketing claims around general business operations and human impacts. A current petition asks the FTC to find that a multinational energy company is misleading the public with any green claims because its core products are fossil fuel derived and its operations disproportionally impact minority communities. As companies trumpet their environmental or social justice accomplishments through ESG reporting, such disclosures and claims are well-served by appropriate and ongoing due diligence to support credibility and avoid challenges.

As the environmental and social justice movements continue to unfold, companies are well served to think ahead and be nimble. ESG disclosures can offer opportunity to reflect the value, and realize the benefit, of corporate actions that implicate both social and environmental impacts. Environmental justice is a prime example of an evolving area of ESG that the market and regulators may likely embrace for increased disclosure.

The companies that will benefit most from increased ESG disclosure are those that have an internal and external strategy for identifying, assessing, addressing and quantifying these risks in their operations. The time is now to seize this moment to meet the expectations of investors, employees, the public, and frankly the world — going forward.

LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Banks are demanding much stricter environmental criteria when financing shipping companies as investor pressure grows on the sector to accelerate going greener, according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Shipping, which transports about 90% of world trade, accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions and BCG forecast the industry will need $2.4 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

""ESG-driven requests are already prompting more action from banks. Shipping is already feeling it and they (shipping companies) are under pressure now,"" said Peter Jameson, partner with BCG, which are consultants for the COP26 UN climate summit that starts on Oct. 31.

Standard Chartered (STAN.L) has already provided loans linked to sustainability targets for drilling group Odfjell and the shipping division of Oman's Asyad Group, the bank has said.

""When looking at lending on new assets, banks are going to create a bigger conduit for CO2 reductions through their policies,"" Jameson told Reuters.

""The banks are also seeing insurance companies feeling shareholder pressure and this is also causing big pension funds to reassess.""

Leading shipping financiers currently provide close to $300 billion of lending to the industry annually, analysts estimate.

Of the $2.4 trillion that BCG estimates will be needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Jameson said $500 billion would be required between now and 2030 with the remaining $1.9 trillion between 2030-2050.

The bulk of the total amount – around $1.7 trillion – would go towards developing future fuels.

""Funding sources are already becoming available, yet plenty more are still required,"" Jameson said.

ESG-related assets under management are estimated to represent up to 80% of total lending to shipping by 2030, BCG said.

UN shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has said it aims to reduce overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050, but industry groups are calling for more progress from governments.

""The risks to balance sheets will start to force more questions being asked to the IMO,"" said Ulrik Sanders, managing director at BCG, adding that this would ""prompt more action towards decarbonisation"".

Oct 12 (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are joining fintech company Ethic, which invests in the environmental, social and governance-focused (ESG) sector, marking yet another major corporate partnership for the couple.

The British couple, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have signed a flurry of corporate deals in a bid to make a living for themselves outside the royal family following a split announced last year.

The couple became investors in Ethic earlier this year and have investments managed by the company as well, it said in a statement.

""They're deeply committed to helping address the defining issues of our time - such as climate, gender equity, health, racial justice, human rights, and strengthening democracy ..."" Ethic said in a statement.

Founded in 2015, Ethic helps investors transition their money toward companies that ""treat people and the planet with respect"".

The partnership comes as more entities are forced to consider the climate when investing and traditional investors are increasingly driven by ESG factors that have earlier not been captured in a company's balance sheet.

Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth, had previously teamed up with the Apple TV+ streaming service to make a documentary with Oprah Winfrey about mental health.

The couple has also inked an exclusive multiyear production deal with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and have signed up to produce programming for Spotify (SPOT.N) that ""uplifts and entertains audiences around the world"" and features ""diverse perspectives and voices"".

He just unveiled plans to relocate the company’s headquarters to Austin. The reasons provided don’t add up, and he probably isn’t escaping the government interference that irked him.

Musk threatened in May last year to up sticks from the Palo Alto area that has served as Tesla’s base since its founding in 2003. The rationale was California’s Covid-19 lockdowns that forced his factory to close, measures he called “fascist”.

Remarks at the annual meeting on Thursday avoided reprising the theme. Instead, Musk linked the decision read more to a lack of space and the cost of living in the Bay Area. Both are valid points, but more for factory workers than well-paid executives. And a head office needn’t be in the same place as what might become its biggest production facility.

There are trade-offs, too. For one thing, Tesla will now be run from a state where its model of selling cars directly to consumers is banned by law as a way of protecting car dealerships. Any Texas residents buying a locally made Model 3 or other vehicle will have to wait until it’s shipped out of state and back first.

Moreover, Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s administration is building a weak track record in green energy. He was one of many right-wing politicians to falsely blame wind power for the state’s electricity generation failure read more in February. He has since pushed to prop up the fossil-fuel industry and load green energy up with more costs.

Women’s rights also have suffered under Abbott. He recently signed a bill outlawing abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, a law now being challenged in the courts read more . Abbott has even implied that Musk supports such policies, though the Tesla boss has obliquely denied it.

These dubious policies are at odds with Tesla’s ambition. It already has faced criticism over how it treats workers, including losing a racism lawsuit read more this week. And it has long been blighted by weak corporate controls. Moving to Texas further mars Musk’s environmental, social and governance credentials, giving investors increasingly focused on such matters even more reasons to think twice.

ESG,PyNews API,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/secs-esg-disclosure-focus-slighting-real-concerns-2021-09-29/,The SEC's ESG disclosure focus — slighting the real concerns - Reuters,"The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 12, 2021.
By engaging in these regulations premised on disclosure, the commission in effect sought to facilitate enhanced corporate governance practices.
The solution is for the securities laws to timely require, absent the presence of justifiable business reason, the public disclosure of all material information.
Moreover, many SEC disclosure documents run well over 100 pages, resulting in information overload.
First, the SEC should undertake an examination of its disclosure rules and minimize requiring disclosure of information that is not material.","The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen at their headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 12, 2021.

September 29, 2021 - From all indications, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler is making ESG (environmental, social, and governance) disclosures a top priority. Disagreeing with this focus, critics argue that the SEC is stretching its mandate too far afield from the economic materiality mandate that underlies the federal securities law framework.

Yet, what the commission is seeking to bring about, as it has done in earlier eras, is to impact substantive corporate conduct through the guise of disclosure. Dating back to 1961, the SEC sought to impact insider conduct by requiring disclosure of management self-dealing transactions.

And, after the Supreme Court in the 1970s rebuffed efforts to elevate the antifraud provisions to encompass substantive fairness, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosure by insiders whether they reasonably believe that a going-private transaction is fair or unfair to unaffiliated shareholders. By engaging in these regulations premised on disclosure, the commission in effect sought to facilitate enhanced corporate governance practices.

The same rationale applies to this latest focus by the commission. Through the requirement of ESG disclosures, the expectation (whether realistic or not) is that publicly held companies will become more sensitized, acting in a more socially conscious manner to protect the environment, promote diversity, and further social awareness — among other objectives.

What is more likely to occur, as it did with the commission's mandate expanding executive remuneration disclosure, is even lengthier disclosure documents exacerbating the information overload problem.

Thus far, the commission is missing the mark. There are real problematic issues that should be addressed. ESG disclosures are mere window-dressing compared to the systematic gaps that currently exist.

In my recent Oxford University Press book ""Rethinking Securities Law,"" I identify 125 recommendations where meaningful reform is needed. A handful of them will be highlighted here. For example, unlike the rule adopted by many developed markets (such as the European Union), a publicly held company has no affirmative duty to disclose under our securities laws all material information to the investing public.

The result is that, without adequate business justification, highly important information can be withheld from the markets. This gap impairs the price efficiency of the securities markets and harms investors. The solution is for the securities laws to timely require, absent the presence of justifiable business reason, the public disclosure of all material information.

As a second example, the status of ""accredited investor"" was adopted by the SEC in Regulation D in 1982. For individuals, it signifies that those persons who have a net worth of $1 million (exclusive of the value of one's principal residence) are irrefutably deemed to have financial sophistication and to have access to registration-type information. The consequence is that in specified exempt offerings, such as Rule 506 offerings, no disclosure is required to be made to such individuals.

Clearly, many of these individuals lack financial sophistication, having reached the $1 million net worth status through, for example, retirement plans, inheritance, or appreciation of personal assets. While the commission should thoroughly reconsider the propriety of accredited investor application, the immediate focus should be on increasing the $1 million net worth level to 2021 dollars adjusted for inflation.

As the commission itself recently admitted, it has declined to do so fearful that such an increase would impede private capital raising. While promoting private capital raising may be a legitimate objective for the commission, it should not outweigh the SEC's investor protection mandate.

Moreover, many SEC disclosure documents run well over 100 pages, resulting in information overload. Relatively few individuals and even organizations have the wherewithal to studiously review these documents.

Two measures, among others, should be adopted. First, the SEC should undertake an examination of its disclosure rules and minimize requiring disclosure of information that is not material. Second, a comprehensive Summary Section should be required for specified SEC filings, such as for registration statements, proxy statements, and quarterly and annual reports.

The inclusion of a mandatory Summary Section contained in the front part of these SEC filings should improve the disclosure process and provide ordinary investors with better access to important information — thereby enabling them to make more informed investment and voting decisions.

As a last example, the U.S. law of insider trading is abysmal. Inconsistencies prevail resulting in disparate treatment for similarly situated persons. Understandably, no other developed market has opted to adopt our approach to insider trading.

Two recommendations are made here. First, a comprehensive ""access"" approach should be enacted, prohibiting those who have unequal access to material nonpublic information from trading on or tipping that information to others.

Second, because insiders always have more information about their companies than outsiders, officers and directors should be required before they trade (rather than afterward which is the current rule) to file a Form with the SEC that is made publicly available.

If the transaction is otherwise permissible, they may then trade their company's securities one business day after filing. As fiduciaries, insiders should not be permitted to be at the front of the line (even with respect to supposedly ""non-material"" information) and relegate shareholders and the investing public to the back of the queue.

There is much meaningful work for the SEC to undertake. The question is whether the members of the commission will have the wherewithal to implement much-needed reform of our securities laws.

Sept 30 (Reuters) - A group of global private equity firms and pensions funds managing over $4 trillion in assets said on Thursday they have agreed to standardize reporting on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance of portfolio companies.

The group, led by Carlyle Group (CG.O) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), will track data on greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, board diversity and other metrics of companies in their portfolio.

The partnership comes at a time when companies, investors and regulators are increasingly asking for more sustainable and inclusive ways of conducting business amid a diversity push and concerns over climate change.

No universally acceptable way of producing ESG metrics exists, leaving investors scrambling to sort through different data from companies as well as disparate scores from ESG rating firms and an alphabet soup of acronyms representing different reporting standards.

""We have found it challenging to effectively measure impact in our private equity portfolio because of the multitude of frameworks and definitions used,"" said Marcie Frost, chief executive officer of CalPERS, which is the largest U.S. public pension fund.

The investor group also includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Blackstone Inc (BX.N), Sweden's EQT AB (EQTAB.ST), Permira and CVC Capital Partners.

Under the initiative, private equity firms will gather and report ESG metrics from their portfolio companies, starting from this year. Boston Consulting Group, a consulting firm, will aggregate the data into an anonymized benchmark.

The founding group plans to meet on an annual basis to assess prior year's data and build on initial metrics, the statement said.

""We were all marching in different directions to achieve similar aims,"" Megan Starr, Carlyle's global head of impact, said in an interview. ""This is actually performance data from the companies themselves and it's not fundamentally competitive with anything that's in the market.”

The group said it will be open to any other private equity firm or investor wishing to join and contribute to its work.

Companies Law firms Firm is launching an ESG institute with UC Berkeley Law

It plans to get more law schools involved in ESG research The company and law firm names shown above are generated automatically based on the text of the article. We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page.

Oct 4 - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison has teamed up with the University of California, Berkeley School of Law to launch a first-of-its kind research initiative centered on ESG — the rapidly growing legal field of environmental, social and governance issues.

As the first partner school in the firm’s ESG and Law Institute, students and professors associated with Berkeley Law’s Business and Society Institute will work with Paul Weiss attorneys to conduct research, convene roundtables and assemble thought leaders in the ESG arena. Paul Weiss will provide two annual $25,000 scholarships to Berkeley students involved in the new institute in the hopes that they will help establish a cohort of young lawyers who are well versed in the many aspects of ESG practice. The firm plans to expand the institute and involve more law schools in the future.

The Berkeley partnership also reflects Paul Weiss' recent Bay Area expansion. The firm launched a Northern California office in July 2020. It now has 17 attorneys.

Institute director Dave Curran, who is also co-chair of Paul Weiss’ ESG advisory practice, said the institute will tackle the big picture, “existential” questions surrounding ESG in a way that lawyers advising clients on day-to-day matters don’t have the capacity to contemplate. And it will bring academic rigor to the conversation around ESG, he said.

“We need a way to convene thought leadership at an elevated and expanded level that I can’t simply do in running a practice,” Curran said. “We also need to involve a broader community, including academics.”

Amelia Miazad, faculty director of Berkeley Law’s Business in Society Institute, said she envisions the new partnership with Paul Weiss bridging the gap between theoretical discussions about ESG and what’s actually happening within companies. Current ESG research tends to fall into either a very practical category like corporate case studies, or very theoretical law review articles.

“What’s exciting here is that we can do something that is really framed for executives and professionals but still leverages that academic rigor and research,” Miazad said.

The research, polling and discussions that the Paul Weiss ESG and Law Institute produces will be publicly available, Curran said, noting that the field is evolving rapidly. Paul Weiss launched its dedicated ESG practice in March of 2020. Kirkland & Ellis; Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld; Norton Rose Fulbright; and Shearman & Sterling were among the earliest firms to launch ESG practices.

“ESG has been around forever,” Curran said. “The difference in the last two years is lawyers recognizing that companies making obligations like social or environmental commitments have to actually live up to those commitments.”

Paul Weiss and its chairman Brad Karp have been notably vocal about social and political issues such as marriage equality, voter protection and reproductive rights. But the firm has also been targeted by critics who say its representation of fossil fuel clients makes it complicit in climate change.

Both Curran and Miazad said they hope the new institute will prompt law schools to incorporate more ESG training into their curriculum. Beyond Berkeley Law, few law schools offer ESG courses other than an occasional class taught by an adjunct, Curran said.

“We want the legal industry to recognize that it’s mission critical for lawyers to deeply understand ESG and how it intersects with the law,” Curran said. “We need students to be thinking about it. This is the fastest growing specialty that no one knows about.”

(Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that other firms also had dedicated ESG practices when Paul Weiss launched its practice last year.)

The EU taxonomy came into force in July last year and aims to help the EU meet climate and energy targets for 2030 and the objectives of the European Green Deal by creating a common definition of ""sustainable.""

The EU taxonomy directs investments toward sustainable businesses by classifying economic activities that are deemed environmentally friendly.

Moody's solution will help market participants navigate the regulation by screening companies and activities against the requirements.

Large players like Moody's developing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance solutions that investment managers can plug and play will be in high demand, given the splurge of related regulations—but smaller fintechs also have a golden opportunity to scale with innovative tools.

In response to allegations of rampant greenwashing , the EU widened its ESG regulatory regime, mandating that corporations disclose nonfinancial ESG performance metrics and making financial market participants disclose sustainability metrics like greenhouse gas emissions.

And with the SEC expected to follow suit imminently, meeting the new regulatory requirements will be a leading priority for investment managers over the next year.

The shift to passive investment strategies is shrinking margins. Rising demand for ESG investing represents one of the few remaining pockets of growth for investment managers, who can charge higher fees for this more nascent strategy.

Fintechs can provide solutions and data to help US investment managers navigate the expanding regulatory requirements and scoop up a slice of the $20 trillion in global AUM that will be created by 2025.

Hopes ESG investment to make FX reserves management sustainable

TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japan will start using foreign reserves to buy securities that meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Friday, joining a trend among global investors to focus on combating climate change.

""Revitalising new ESG investment will help achieve a greener society and carbon neutrality in 2050,"" Suzuki said. ""As the ESG bond market grows, I believe investment in ESG bonds will increase from now on.""

RIYADH, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to issue green bonds soon, an official said on Monday, as the oil-producing kingdom seeks to embrace environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns to expand its investor base and finance a transition to a greener economy.

Hani Al-Medaini, acting chief executive officer of the Finance Ministry's National Debt Management Center, said the government will also be looking at financing backed by export credit agencies, in addition to conventional and Islamic bonds.

He was speaking at an investment conference in Riyadh.

The Gulf has seen a surge of interest in ESG-related initiatives and deals amid growing awareness among global investors about ESG risks.

Saudi Arabia has recently hired banks to advise it on a sustainability financing framework, and sovereign fund Public Investment Fund said it planned to announce soon its first green debt deal. read more

Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, the chairman of Saudi Arabia's Capital Markets Authority, speaking at the same conference, said on Monday he expected an increase in green financing instruments in the kingdom, supported by growth in the domestic debt markets and higher participation of foreign investors.

LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Nearly half of the 100 biggest companies listed on Britain's FTSE Index have no net-zero target at all and just 23 have a scientifically approved plan, according to ESG investment research and asset manager Arabesque.

Britain wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the economy to net-zero by 2050 while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed enthusiasm for leading a green revolution to force Western economies to kick their addiction to fossil fuels.

Arabesque research found that 45 companies on the FTSE-100 Index had no net zero target. Just 23 companies had set net zero targets meeting the standards of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which defines best practice in such targets.

The research found that 28 FTSE companies are on course to contribute to a global temperature rise of 2.7 degrees Celsius or above by 2050. Scientists believe such a rise would lead to a worst-case climate scenario.

The results of the research are a potential embarrassment for the British government just days before it hosts a major climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland.

""These findings show a wide gulf between where the FTSE 100 stands today, and where it needs to be to deliver on the UK’s net zero target,"" Daniel Klier, president of Arabesque, said.

""Most of the UK’s biggest firms are not on a path to reach net zero by 2050 and we will need to see a significant change in business models and capital allocation.""

Among the best performing 20 British FTSE-100 companies on climate were AstraZeneca (AZN.L), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Burberry (BRBY.L), Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L), Arabesque said. The worst performing companies, according to Arabesque, were miners and energy companies.

Klier said Britain’s top firms were performing worse on climate than comparative companies in the United States, Japan, Germany and France.

""The performance of our biggest businesses will be one of our greatest challenges to achieving net zero, but also, where one of our biggest opportunities to reduce emissions will lie,"" Klier said.

""The time for commitments is now passing, however, and 2022 must be a year of action.""

ROME, Sept 30 (Reuters) - ""Bold and urgent"" international coordination is needed to make data companies provide on environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators more robust and prevent greenwashing, the head of Italy's central bank said on Thursday.

A lack of regulation to strengthen ESG indicators has prompted concerns among investors and environmentalists that companies might get better ESG ratings than they deserve because of data that makes them appear more sustainable than they really are.

""The fact that there is no obligation to oversee firms' non-financial communications, the absence of standardised indicators... leave room for firms to attempt to alter the external perception of their sustainability in order to attract funds,"" Ignazio Visco said at a conference.

Visco said ""bold and urgent"" coordination was needed at the international level to deliver better data to measure the impact of climate change on the economy and the financial system.
